Over the two day span, forum moderators will be available online to help new contributors and answer questions as needed.

Working together in person is really fun, so we highly recommend trying to get some folks together if you&#8217;re able, but if that&#8217;s not possible you can still connect to other participants online. Either way, this is a great way to give back to the WordPress project and have some fun helping people at the same time.</p>\n<p>Interested? <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/support/20-questions/">Get the details on how to participate</a>.</p>\n<p>Hope to see you next weekend!</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:39:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"WordPress 4.4.1 Security and Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/01/wordpress-4-4-1-security-and-maintenance-release/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 06 Jan 2016 20:07:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Security";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"4.4";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4041";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:376:"WordPress 4.4.1 is now available.

You can even embed <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/">previews of posts</a> from other WordPress sites by pasting the URL on its own line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There have been a lot of changes for developers to play with as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>REST API (phase 1) </strong>— The underlying infrastructure of the WordPress REST API <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/">plugin</a> has been <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/">included in WordPress 4.4</a>.

Also, the underlying <code>WP_Term</code> class improves caching when working with terms. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14162">#14162</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Improved <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> output</strong> — <code>wp_title()</code> is now deprecated; WordPress can <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/20/document-title-in-4-4/">handle the rendering</a> of the document title automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Comments </strong>— Comment queries are now split for performance.

It can make you reexamine assumptions, take you out of your comfort zone, or make you appreciate the thing you gave up much more when you return to it.

It&#8217;s a valuable service that keeps things moving along in tickets and helps patches make their way into core.</p>\n<p>The most challenging part of testing patches is getting your testing environment set up properly. The WordPress core handbook has <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/patch/" target="_blank">instructions for using Grunt to test patches</a>, but they&#8217;re not easy to follow if you happen to be a more visual learner.</p>\n<p>Yesterday Ryan Boren published a tutorial for <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/flow/2016/02/08/testing-patches-with-vvv-on-mac-os/" target="_blank">testing patches with VVV on Mac OS</a>, complete with screenshots at every step. The bulk of the instructions cover establishing a test environment with <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV" target="_blank">VVV</a>, which requires you to install Vagrant, install Virtualbox, initialize Vagrant, install Git, and finally install VVV. Applying a patch and reverting it after testing is probably the easiest part of the entire process.</p>\n<p>Boren&#8217;s tutorial is one of the clearest and easiest to follow, because it helps you visualize what success looks like at every step. If you want to add mobile testing into the mix while testing patches, check out his <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/03/16/mobile-patch-testing-with-vvv-and-xip-io/" target="_blank">post</a> on using VVV and <a href="http://xip.io/" target="_blank">xip.io</a>. Boren explained how he goes through tickets with patches that change UI and adds mobile and desktop screenshots of his testing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These screenshots hasten UI feedback and usually reveal visual glitches on mobile that are then patched up, making our mobile experience that little bit better,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Until that blue sky someday when I can apply patches to a patch server with a tap, I’ve found VVV and xip.io to be the easiest way to do localhost testing of patches from mobile devices.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The process of setting up a test environment is the most time-consuming aspect of testing patches, but once you have it in place, it&#8217;s easy to apply them.

These include a classic blog, modern blog, portfolio, magazine, and business theme. The new <a href="http://components.underscores.me/" target="_blank">Components</a> website lets theme authors download a theme that includes reusable components tailored to each theme type.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/components-portfolio.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51354"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/components-portfolio.png?resize=1025%2C625" alt="components-portfolio" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51354" /></a></p>\n<p>Each theme includes general layout structures and templates to support the specific type of theme. For example, when you select the &#8216;Portfolio&#8217; starter theme, your download will include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A portfolio post type, courtesy of Jetpack, added to all the necessary files</li>\n<li>A grid portfolio view</li>\n<li>A single column blog template</li>\n<li>A sliding panel for navigation, social menu, and also widgets</li>\n<li>A large featured image with full-width script</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&#8217;s not much to see once the theme is installed, because it&#8217;s just a starting point designed to save time when building layouts and templates. Automattic&#8217;s theme team used its collective knowledge of developing hundreds of themes in order to create these five starter themes with the bare basics required for presenting content via these five major theme categories.</p>\n<p>Components was inspired by the community behind Underscores, according to Automattic theme wrangler David Kennedy. Developers using the starter theme often offered contributions that were beyond the scope of a simple starter theme.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While maintaining and improving Underscores, we always see great pull requests from the community that we turn away because the contributions end up being too specific for a normal starter theme,&#8221; Kennedy said. &#8220;Many of those additions would have been perfect in most themes. Now, some of them have a home in a project that zeroes in on a certain kind of user with each theme it builds.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The project&#8217;s goal is to provide a &#8220;more modular, pattern-based approach to theme development.&#8221; Even if you&#8217;re not building with Underscores, many of the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/theme-components/tree/master/components" target="_blank">theme components</a> included in this project can be easily reused elsewhere as theme building blocks.

There is a proposal on the table by the core team of four contributors — Ryan McCue, Rachel Baker, Daniel Bachhuber, and Joe Hoyle — to ship endpoints to WordPress core iteratively. There is a pushback on this proposal by WordPress Project Lead and co-founder Matt Mullenweg.</p>\n<p>The API should be iterative, and should not require complete admin parity to be included, as Matt has proposed.</p>\n<h3>The state of what’s already in core, and what’s pending</h3>\n<p>The REST API infrastructure is already in core, having been included in WordPress 4.4. The infrastructure provides just that, an underlying infrastructure, to offer plugins a suite of base functionality to utilize, making the development of their own RESTful features easier.</p>\n<p>The infrastructure allows developers to get a huge head start for creating their own REST API endpoints and functionality. The endpoints are how a third party client or developer would actually interact with the API, and the endpoints for WordPress core functionality are what are in debate.</p>\n<p>Every piece of WordPress functionality — data that can be read, created, updated, or deleted — would ideally be available to the WordPress REST API, so that anything possible in WordPress is also possible via the API, and therefore also possible from a third party application interacting with the API.</p>\n<p>However, creating this complete coverage is unrealistic in the current WordPress development structure, and should not be necessary for shipping initial endpoints to WordPress Core.</p>\n<p>The proposal from the core REST API team is to begin by shipping four core WordPress objects: posts (meaning the posts table, which includes all post types), terms, comments, and users. These four core objects have been developed as endpoints, are well tested, and are ready for core. There are kinks to work out, but overall, they are an excellent starting point.</p>\n<p>Matt’s proposal is that the API should not ship in core, with any endpoints, until complete “wp-admin coverage” is available: meaning that until all actions a user can make in the WordPress admin can be achieved via the API, then it shouldn’t go into core. He said in a <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core-restapi/p1454626846001168">meeting about the API</a>, to firm up his proposal, that there should be, &#8220;no partial endpoints in core. let’s design a complete API, not half-do it and foist it on millions of sites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The primary areas not covered by the API currently are as follows: widget management and display, menu management and display, theme and plugin management, multisite management, and site options management.</p>\n<p>So Matt would like to see each of these endpoints be developed and battle tested before any endpoints ship in core. I agree with the REST API team that the first four objects should take priority, and should go in before these other objects are ready. The remaining objects should each be feature plugins of their own, and go in over time, as they are ready, without delaying the four core objects currently under review.</p>\n<h3>Many use cases covered</h3>\n<p>Posts, terms, comments, and users endpoints make up practically all WordPress content. This means that a huge swath of use cases for the API are covered with these four objects.</p>\n<p>Matt’s thinking that a core WordPress REST API should have all or nothing coverage is a false dichotomy. Applications like <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/">Calypso</a> — a WordPress admin replacement based on WordPress.com’s own and separate REST API — are, I believe, the exception for usage of the REST API, not the rule. I believe most people that would take advantage of the REST API’s core inclusion are going to use parts of it only, and I believe most of what they’ll be seeking is content related, versus site management.</p>\n<p>The WordPress admin is exhaustive: it’s pretty much anything and everything one would want to do in WordPress. Custom admins that would utilize the REST API are unlikely to completely mimic the current admin; if they were to do so, it’d be difficult to see the point of making such an application interface, versus just using the tried and true default. I’m certain <em>some</em> new full implementations of the admin will show up (similar to Calypso), but I don’t think it’ll be a common use case.</p>\n<p>More likely, even custom admins would mostly be in the business of manipulating content — specifically catering content editing experiences for a specific type of website — and would be satisfied creating their own custom endpoints for other site management tasks until those endpoints are available through feature plugins or in core itself.</p>\n<p>For tasks such as custom front-end websites that are decoupled from WordPress, the WordPress REST API is immediately useful, using the four proposed objects. <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/05/rest-api-meeting-summary-feb-4/#comment-29219">As K. Adam White said</a>, delaying the endpoints that are ready, “will effectively block a significant group of potential adopters coming from external platforms.”</p>\n<h3>The value of core inclusion, verses keeping endpoints in the plugin</h3>\n<p>Core inclusion of endpoints is a stamp of approval that the endpoints are ready for prime time. Organizations that would use the API for bespoke applications would prefer to know that the endpoints will be ready and available for the long term, and keeping endpoints out of core is a sign — intended or not — that things can change, and will prevent adoption that is important for WordPress’s growth.</p>\n<p>Whereas, <a href="http://journal.rmccue.io/340/progressive-enhancement-with-the-wordpress-rest-api/">a procedure of iterative development</a>, vertically focused by endpoint, can be a signal of readiness provided by the WordPress core team, essentially saying that those endpoints in core are stable and will maintain WordPress’s well known commitment to backward compatibility, while those endpoints in the feature plugin may be stable, but are subject to change.</p>\n<h3>Iteration has been good for WordPress</h3>\n<p>Iteration has been paramount to nearly all WordPress features, and it doesn’t make sense why it wouldn’t be a part of the REST API’s core inclusion.</p>\n<p>In a meeting about the status of the API, Matt Mullenweg said, “I know it’s a minority opinion, but I would be pretty skeptical of merging a partial API into core, I think it would do a lot more damage than benefit.” I fail to understand what kind of damage including these endpoints would cause.</p>\n<p>Matt <a href="https://ma.tt/2016/02/chicken-and-eggs/">has insinuated</a> that the API as-is would be like shipping a car with no wheels, and I vehemently disagree with the analogy. I think the API is more like a Prius, and the goal is a Tesla. It’s a hybrid, with partial but important coverage, that betters the web (or the environment, for the car analogy). It’s not full coverage (like the fully electric Tesla), but it’s better than nothing (gas guzzler!). Okay, enough analogies, because honestly those don’t help that much. But the API as-is is certainly not a wheel-less car. It’s a perfectly drivable and nice car, it’s just not yet fully the car of tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Iteration and WordPress have gone hand in hand for ages. Almost every feature I can think of in WordPress has iterated over time, from the initial release: the Customizer, WordPress media management, custom post types, menu management, and more. It’s important to ship features that work, but that doesn’t mean they have to be exactly what you envision. WordPress itself is far from perfect, yet it’s available for download. Every lead developer could tell you dozens of things they’d like to improve, but they’re perfectly fine shipping new releases without every one of those new features.</p>\n<h3>Vertically integrated API support</h3>\n<p>Let’s do a mental exercise on the difference between building horizontal and vertical support in the API. This isn’t how one would really build an API, but it’s how we’ll envision calculating support for it.</p>\n<p>If you envision the WordPress dashboard, there are many paths you can take. Every top level admin tab is available to you: Add new post, visit the settings page, choose a theme, etc. The REST API cannot currently mimic every action you can take. I would define horizontal support as visiting the admin, identifying each potential action one step away from that first view, and creating that functionality with the REST API. You’d have a lot more endpoints, but the endpoints would be incomplete — and one layer deep.</p>\n<p>The next step, if working horizontally, would be to take each new view you just visited, based on the previous action, and do it again. This would cover <em>a lot more</em> functionality. Change widget order, move menu items around, delete comments, etc. But there are yet further levels you can take each of these screens. However, say the initial screen had 12 possible events, and now each of those 12 has 12 possible events, you now have 144 events to mimic in the API, but you still have layers to go before you have complete support of any particular fully fledged task.</p>\n<p>If you continue that process, you’ll be attacking support horizontally, and you’ll be at it for a long time.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s think vertically. Let’s choose an end goal: like publish a blog post. Okay, now let’s go back to the admin. This time, we’re going to enable support for adding new posts with the API; that’s one action, and we’re going to ignore other possible actions that don’t have to do with adding a post.</p>\n<p>On our next screen, we have new options, but not all of them are explicitly about publishing a post. However, many of these options are important to publishing a post: information like assigning an author (users), and putting the post into a category (terms). So we’re going to do what we need to do with each of these things that enables us to better support posting. </p>\n<p>Okay, so we can now publish a post via the API, and we’ve also enabled baseline support for stuff that posts expect. The next step in the flow may be that someone would comment on that post. So we’re going vertically through the process. We’re providing complete coverage for these steps. And it gets more complicated than what I’ve said so far. Posts could have meta data, or be password protected, or they might be multiple post types. </p>\n<p>Each of these creates new considerations we must account for to have complete vertical coverage of the process of publishing a post. We haven’t even touched managing site settings or other functionality that doesn’t apply to publishing a post. But as we realize the stuff that interacts with this most important task of publishing content, we begin to form a minimum viable product for our API, to know what we need to ship to fully and well support all things posts with the API. You may still take 144 steps, but at the end, you’ll have more coverage of fewer things, versus light coverage of all things.</p>\n<p>This is what the REST API team has done with these four objects. Posts, terms, users, and comments are the content processing experience in WordPress. It’s a fully fledged API experience, without shortcuts. There are challenges of course, and room to improve, but from top to bottom the process of content creation and manipulation is part of the API.</p>\n<p>As the REST API team have said in various channels during this debate, the non-supported endpoints are mostly isolated from the publishing experience. Supporting posts is co-dependent on supporting the author of the post, and the terms for the post. Supporting the settings screens for the website, or managing themes and plugins, or managing widget areas are not co-dependent on the post experience.</p>\n<p>These other verticals are important, and it is everyone’s goals to create broad, horizontal support of WordPress functionality. But it should be done one vertical feature at a time, and we shouldn’t wait to ship something that is near ready for prime time until we’ve supported absolutely everything. For one, the API is useful to many people <em>right now</em>, but also, the API, unless the entire development strategy of WordPress changes, will <em>never</em> be caught up to support every WordPress feature.</p>\n<h3>Truly “complete coverage” would require API-first driven development</h3>\n<p>For the WordPress REST API to truly have “complete coverage” of WordPress features, then the API would have to be the first consideration when building a new feature. This wouldn’t be a bad thing! But it’s not the way WordPress development works right now.</p>\n<p>Stripe is a great example. When you hear a developer talk about Stripe, the popular merchant processor, the first thing they’ll say is how good the API is. Well, that’s because Stripe <em>is</em> the Stripe API. No feature ships unless it started with API coverage.</p>\n<p>Developers love working with Stripe, because anything that can be accomplished with Stripe is accomplished with the API. With WordPress, the REST API team is running to catch up with core development; core development is not centrally focused around the REST API.</p>\n<p>And as long as core development operates outside the scope of API-first, then the API will always be running to catch up, and the smaller team surrounding API development will never maintain pace with core.</p>\n<p>WordPress already learned this lesson with unit testing. For years, unit testing was nice to have, but not required for commit. Today, WordPress has unit testing coverage of <a href="http://scotty-t.com/coverage/index.html">less than 50%</a>, even though all new commits require tests. Unit testing, though now a first class citizen to WordPress development, is still catching up.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying whether or not WordPress should be developed API-first, but I am saying that Matt’s goal of complete coverage <em>before shipping</em> would just mean the API will never ship, because it will <em>never</em> have complete coverage with the current development strategy.</p>\n<h3>The importance of adoption, and design for the majority</h3>\n<p>It was recently pointed out that the REST API infrastructure is only used by 20 plugins. It makes it appear as if it’s not an important WordPress feature, and that sentiment is wrong.</p>\n<p>Consider nearly any other software. I’ll use MailChimp as an example this time. Loads of people use Mailchimp. Mailchimp has a REST API, and I use it for Post Status. My implementation is not one of their official integrations, which they noted they have 845 of <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/planet/feed/">in their 2015 report</a>. Mine is just me interacting with their API — only trackable by counting total API calls.</p>\n<p>Well, Mailchimp has millions of users, and those millions of user accounts sent over 204 billion emails in 2015. A fraction of those users (I assume) are responsible for more than 29 billion calls to Mailchimp’s API, either through custom interactions (like me), or through one of the 845 official Mailchimp integrations. It really doesn’t matter that there are only 845 integrations with Mailchimp’s API; because the impact of those integrations and the developers otherwise interacting with the API had huge implications that make Mailchimp a more attractive service.</p>\n<p>The second <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/">core philosophy</a> of WordPress is to “design for the majority.” It says, “Many end users of WordPress are non-technically minded. They don’t know what AJAX is, nor do they care about which version of PHP they are using.” And while this is true, it doesn’t mean that technical features don’t benefit the majority, even if they aren’t directly interacting with them.</p>\n<p>The WordPress REST API is an invisible feature to most users, but it also will eventually impact nearly all users of WordPress. Like Mailchimp and Stripe, the WordPress REST API can and will impact the overall experience of using WordPress itself. Especially as third parties create gateways for interaction with millions of WordPress installs via the API, the API will be very much for the majority. But it will always be the kind of situation where a small number of integrations are responsible for a large number of interactions.</p>\n<p>We should not base our decision making process for including the API in core on how many plugins are currently supporting the API. We should base our decision making on the potential impact developers can have developing applications with WordPress via the REST API, by utilizing the power in the API — power that can be utilized to improve publishing for everyone.</p>\n<h3>The time for the WordPress REST API is now</h3>\n<p>The time for the WordPress REST API is now. The API is not complete, but it is ready. This is <a href="https://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/">step one</a>. There are <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/05/rest-api-meeting-summary-feb-4/">real issues</a> to be resolved with the first four objects, but the first four objects should not sit on the sidelines, excluded from WordPress core, because “complete coverage” doesn’t yet exist.</p>\n<p>There is a capable and willing team driving the WordPress REST API. We all owe our gratitude to Ryan McCue, Rachel Baker, Daniel Bachhuber, Joe Hoyle, and the other contributors that have worked tirelessly — many of them for many years — to make the WordPress REST API a reality.</p>\n<p>We should not take these efforts for granted. A contributor’s time is finite, and everyone that’s worked hard on the API could have spent that time on other things. While time spent shouldn’t be our metric for including a feature in core, we should consider it now. This team has worked for a long time, all along asking for others to provide feedback, and at the 11th hour a vocal (and powerful) minority have decided to throw considerable roadblocks at their efforts.</p>\n<p>The WordPress REST API is a good feature for WordPress to have. REST APIs are a staple of modern web applications. The endpoints proposed for core inclusion is a reasonable next step after the infrastructure that <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-4-4/">went in WordPress 4.4</a>. Whether these first four objects are ready for 4.5, or get postponed until 4.6 isn’t a huge deal; they should be ready before they are merged. But they should not be sidelined until the fantasy of complete coverage is met.</p>\n<p>The inclusion of the WordPress REST API should be iterative, smart, and focused. It shouldn’t be all or nothing. It should be now.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 09 Feb 2016 21:03:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:103:"WPTavern: WP REST API Team Releases Version 2 Beta 12, Seeks Feedback from WordPress’ Lead Developers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51322";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:109:"http://wptavern.com/wp-rest-api-team-releases-version-2-beta-12-seeks-feedback-from-wordpress-lead-developers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6785:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-rest-api.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-43000"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-rest-api.jpg?resize=1025%2C469" alt="wp-rest-api" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43000" /></a></p>\n<p>The WP REST API team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/02/09/wp-rest-api-version-2-0-beta-12/" target="_blank">released version 2 beta 12</a> today. Daniel Bachhuber highlighted the breaking changes in the release that developers will want to digest before updating. This includes the removal of meta endpoints from the primary plugin into its own feature plugin, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api-meta-endpoints/" target="_blank">now available on WordPress.org</a>.</p>\n<p>In a <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributors-look-for-a-path-forward-for-the-wp-rest-api#comment-143820" target="_blank">comment</a> on our coverage of the continuing discussion, WP REST API team member <a href="https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle" target="_blank">Joe Hoyle</a> clarified the team&#8217;s position on the endpoints&#8217; readiness for core:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For the record, the REST API Team support further iteration on the existing endpoints before being merged into core. That could mean waiting for the WordPress.com API team to use those endpoints in production, or gathering more usage feedback from others. I am strongly against merging anything before it’s been well-proven and well-tested.</p>\n<p>The proposal by the team was to include the 4 content endpoints when they are ready. We had a lengthly overview as to the progress of those endpoints, more details on what we feel is left to be done can be seen at the <a href="https://github.com/wp-api/wp-api/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A2.0" target="_blank">issues queue for the 2.0 milestone</a>.</p>\n<p>Why these endpoints specifically? Because they are co-dependent for the most part. Shipping Posts without support for Taxonomies would not be that useful.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hoyle also cautions that pursuing full coverage of wp-admin is a monumental task that could take several more years:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Going for development of _all_ functionality (somewhere around 8-10 total data routes) should not be underestimated. It’s taken somewhere around a year and a half to get the current 4 to where they are now, and that was with 2 years prior art from Version 1.</p>\n<p>As someone who has been in the weeds of that implementation for a while now, I cannot over over-stress just how tricky trying to retrofit a consistent, coherent interface on 13 years of organically grown code and ideas can become. I’m looking forward to being part of the writing the implementation for the remaining (and majority) of functionality, however I don’t want to stop users and developers benefitting from what is already being built for another [several] years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hoyle emphasized that the team is not proposing merging the existing endpoints now, but he believes they are getting very close.</p>\n<p>With the release of v2 beta 12, Bachhuber urged WordPress lead developers and committers to offer official feedback in hopes of building a consensus. Given the disagreements in the <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-rest-api-delayed-contributors-facing-gridlock" target="_blank">recent meeting</a>, it&#8217;s clear that WordPress contributors have not been on the same page as far as what constitutes core readiness for the project.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Right about now seems like a good time to get official feedback on WP REST API from <a href="https://twitter.com/WordPress">@wordpress</a>''s lead developers and committers. Just sayin''</p>\n<p>&mdash; Daniel Bachhuber (@danielbachhuber) <a href="https://twitter.com/danielbachhuber/status/697067292782235648">February 9, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Feedback from contributors is starting to trickle in. WordPress core committer Jeremy Felt shared his thoughts in a <a href="https://jeremyfelt.com/2016/02/09/thoughts-on-merging-the-wp-rest-api-plugin/" target="_blank">post</a> on his blog today:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’m in favor of the REST API team’s proposal to merge the endpoints for the primary objects in WordPress—posts, comments, users, terms—when they’re ready.</p>\n<p>When the endpoints for these objects are ready, I would like to see them merged early in a release cycle.</p>\n<p>With these primary endpoints in, front end workflows can immediately start to take advantage. This is something groups have been doing for years with custom code already. Getting these groups to use the same structure is valuable.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Core committer Weston Ruter summarized his opinion in a tweet:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/danielbachhuber">@danielbachhuber</a> I''m for iterative inclusion of REST API endpoints, advising clients to make use of feature detection.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Weston Ruter ⚡ (@westonruter) <a href="https://twitter.com/westonruter/status/697088319423778816">February 9, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The plugin is moving forward with regular betas while the discussion continues. Developers who are using the API in beta will need to continue to follow the project closely, as the latest beta makes changes to available features. 10up developer Eric Mann tweeted some of <a href="https://twitter.com/EricMann/status/697111525979328512" target="_blank">his challenges in using the API in beta</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>My client installed the REST API before it included post meta. We had to build a bunch of custom work to support meta. Then the REST API updated to include meta and broke our integration. I spent a chunk of hours refactoring to compensate so we could update. Now, apparently, the REST API is pulling that meta support out and putting it in a separate plugin. Yet people still criticize me for saying I&#8217;m wary of placing too much dependency on the stability of the API.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Joe Hoyle is currently crowdsourcing stats on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V-9s0U407iOR1II6yWOqBboMe9M6J7oeOJmwxpOvd9E/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">projects that are using the WP REST API v2 in production</a>. Developers who have stepped up to use the API have had to be nimble in accommodating its rapid development. At this time, the WP REST API team agrees that further iteration on the existing endpoints will be necessary before merging them into core. Continued feedback from developers with projects that use the API will be critical for demonstrating that the API has been well tested.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 09 Feb 2016 20:33:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"WPTavern: WordPress Theme Review Team Recommends Authors Start Keeping a Change Log";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51297";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-recommends-authors-start-keeping-a-change-log";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2723:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/writing.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-51302"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/writing.jpg?resize=1025%2C472" alt="photo credit: Green Chameleon" class="size-full wp-image-51302" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/8Y0EDX4VP9">Green Chameleon</a>\n<p>Last April, WordPress Theme Review Team member Jose Castaneda <a href="http://wptavern.com/do-wordpress-org-themes-need-a-changelog" target="_blank">proposed that the team adopt a standard change log format</a>. Theme authors are not yet required to keep a change log but the general consensus is that it&#8217;s a good practice that benefits users.</p>\n<p>Castaneda <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1452621691006215" target="_blank">revived the topic of change logs</a> during the team&#8217;s most recent meeting, saying he hopes this will be the year that they can finally standardize the readme.txt file and take action on the change log-related trac tickets. This would require action on <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45" target="_blank">a meta trac ticket</a> to add change logs to the WordPress.org theme listing tabs and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22810" target="_blank">a core ticket</a> that would expose the change log to users in the WordPress admin.</p>\n<p>Castaneda <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2016/02/08/making-a-changelog-work-for-you/" target="_blank">posted</a> some basic recommendations as a first step towards educating theme authors on the proper format for writing a change log:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Listing versions in reverse-chronological order (newest on top)</li>\n<li>One sub-section per version</li>\n<li>Group changes made per version</li>\n<li>Don’t dump commit logs (if using version control)</li>\n<li>Emphasize deprecations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even though a change log is not yet exposed in wp-admin, theme authors can still write one for users who are willing to do a bit of looking before updating.

Differences of opinion are driving a heated debate about what constitutes a goalpost for the API&#8217;s readiness for core.</p>\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href="https://ma.tt/2016/02/chicken-and-eggs/" target="_blank">Chicken and Egg</a>,&#8221; Mullenweg addressed the recent WP REST API discussion while sharing an anecdote from a book that covers history from the mid-90s hip-hop era.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I love the idea of Questlove realizing the song was missing something, and going back to the booth to keep working on it until it resonated with his target audience. A song that doesn’t stand up on its own wouldn’t be any better when bundled as part of an album. (Or Samsung would have the most popular apps on Android.) Fans hear the care and quality of each track, and they become super-fans.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg relates it to considerations when building products for the web:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There’s this tension in everything we produce. Where’s the line to tread between <a href="https://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/" target="_blank">1.0 is the loneliest</a> and <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles" target="_blank">a minimum viable product</a>? Or is it about a <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles" target="_blank">minimum lovable product</a>? Are we building a car with no air conditioning or a car with no wheels?</p>\n<p>&#8216;Pivot&#8217; has become passé, but it’s much worse to assume that distribution will solve something core to your product that isn’t working.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullenweg <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core-restapi/p1454630772001445" target="_blank">mentioned the same car analogy</a> during the meeting last week. In response to a commenter who asked for more clarification on how the analogy applies to the REST API, Mullenweg said the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you want a good heuristic to use generally: there were decades of cars, millions of vehicles and drivers, before they had air conditioning. The core value proposition of a car is transportation, AC just helps you get there more comfortably. You didn’t need a car to get AC, you could have it in your house. AC might cause you to chose one car over another, but you probably wouldn’t walk or ride a horse if the car didn’t have AC, you’d just roll down the windows.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This begs the question, what constitutes wheels? Contributors to this discussion are divided on whether or not the existing endpoints are ready to be merged into core. The WP REST API team members, many of whom are already successfully using the API in production, believe that the endpoints are ready now. The current state of the API offers the ability to get content in and out of WordPress, opening it up for easier communication with other platforms, which many believe is the primary use case.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg and others who joined the discussion last week are in favor of delivering something more complete, a REST API that supports everything available in wp-admin. This includes WordPress&#8217; many site management features and would put the API several releases away from core readiness.</p>\n<p>In a <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-rest-api-delayed-contributors-facing-gridlock#comment-142834" target="_blank">comment</a> on our initial report, Drew Jaynes advocated what he believes to be a middle ground that provides a solid jumping-off point. This would involve resolving the missing pieces in the existing endpoints before merging them (items like password-protected posts, autosaves and post previews, and meta.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I and others from the contributor/committer camp said in the chat, there can be a middle ground,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Whether that ends up looking like the four core endpoints alone, four core endpoints with some flavor, XML-RPC parity, or some measure of wp-admin parity, remains to be seen,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href="http://journal.rmccue.io/340/progressive-enhancement-with-the-wordpress-rest-api/" target="_blank">Progressive Enhancement with the WordPress REST API</a>,&#8221; Ryan McCue outlined a full-on iterative approach that would push for distribution now and roll out more endpoints in future releases:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Progressive enhancement is our key solution to a couple of related problems: forward-compatibility with future features and versions of WordPress, and robust handling of data types in WordPress. Progressive enhancement also unblocks the REST API project and ensures there’s no need to wait until the REST API has parity with every feature of the WordPress admin.</p></blockquote>\n<p>McCue&#8217;s post goes into further detail of the REST API&#8217;s feature detection capabilities, which allow developers to easily detect support for features and build them in a forwards-compatible way while waiting for core support.</p>\n<h3>Is Distribution the Answer?</h3>\n<p>During last week&#8217;s meeting McCue <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core-restapi/p1454633021001594" target="_blank">said</a> that continuing the project&#8217;s development as a feature plugin will do more harm than good. If the REST API is not allowed to ship without offering support for everything in wp-admin, the team would be forced to continue iterating on it as a feature plugin while simultaneously resolving difficult roadblocks in WordPress core. With just four major contributors operating at less than part time on the project, this requirement could stall the WP REST API indefinitely.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe that the progressive enhancement approach is the best approach for continuing API development,&#8221; McCue said. &#8220;Progressive enhancement is a paradigm the REST API project ​must​ adopt, if it’s an API we want to add to (without breaking backwards compatibility) over the next 10 years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg, who has led an iterative approach to development throughout WordPress&#8217; history, is wary of latching onto distribution as the only way forward.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/Krogsgard">@Krogsgard</a> No one is against iteration. It''s: iterate in plugin with low stakes, or iterate in core, shipping to tens of millions of sites?</p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/696765965334290432">February 8, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The larger WordPress&#8217; usage becomes, the louder its footsteps are heard. Iterating on the REST API in core, with distribution to millions of sites, may affect the web in ways contributors cannot yet anticipate. As they say, heavy is the head that wears the crown. The ripples extend beyond WordPress sites to the outside platforms that will also consume the API.</p>\n<p>Contributors are still discussing the nuances of iterative development in core vs. delivering a more complete API. Meanwhile, adoption is stilted by the uncertainty surrounding the project and the fact that it still carries a plugin dependency. It&#8217;s not yet clear whether WordPress contributors will dig in and push for inclusion of the endpoints against Mullenweg&#8217;s recommendation or whether they will opt to spend more time polishing the existing endpoints. If the WP REST API team is required to ensure that the API can support a wp-admin replacement, it may not land in core until the end of this year or later.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 08 Feb 2016 22:06:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"WPTavern: WordPress.org Has Fewer Than 20 Plugins Using the WP REST API in Core";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51234";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-has-fewer-than-20-plugins-using-the-wp-rest-api-v2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6523:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/plugin.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-34902"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/plugin.jpg?resize=1024%2C485" alt="Plugin Recommendations Featured Image" class="size-full wp-image-34902" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/electrospray/164932344/">when i was a bird</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>During <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-rest-api-delayed-contributors-facing-gridlock" target="_blank">yesterday&#8217;s pivotal WP REST API meeting</a>, WordPress contributors discussed adoption of the API. A cursory search of the WordPress.org plugin directory shows that fewer than two dozen plugins are currently using the API scaffolding included in WordPress 4.4. For reference, here are the 20 plugins identified by Mika Epstein during the meeting, along with active installation numbers for each:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-to-rest-api/" target="_blank">ACF to REST API</a> &#8211; 200+</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-to-wp-api/" target="_blank">ACF to WP-API</a> &#8211; 1,000+</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-to-wp-rest-api/" target="_blank">ACF to WP REST API</a> &#8211; 300+</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-contact-forms/" target="_blank">Custom Contact Forms</a> &#8211; 70,000+</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/dashboard-directory-size/" target="_blank">Dashboard Directory Size</a> &#8211; 100+</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/invitations-for-slack/" target="_blank">Invitations for Slack</a> &#8211; less than 10</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jwt-authentication-for-wp-rest-api/" target="_blank">JWT Authentication for WP REST API</a> &#8211; 100+</li>\n<li>oEmbed API &#8211; no longer available as of 2/5/2016</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/prayers/" target="_blank">Prayers</a> &#8211; less than 10</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/" target="_blank">WP REST API</a> &#8211; 9,000+</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-json/" target="_blank">REST JSON</a> &#8211; less than 10</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-routes/" target="_blank">REST Routes</a> &#8211; less than 10</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/searchwp-api/" target="_blank">SearchWP API</a> &#8211; 20+</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/store-locator-le/" target="_blank">Maps by Storelocator Plus</a> &#8211; 10,000+</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tabulate/" target="_blank">Tabulate</a> &#8211; 100+</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-api-categoriestags/" target="_blank">WP API Categories + Tags</a> &#8211; 10+</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-api-menus/" target="_blank">WP API Menus</a> &#8211; 700+</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rest-api-log/" target="_blank">WP REST API Log</a> &#8211; 100+</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rest-api-sidebars/" target="_blank">WP REST API Sidebars</a> &#8211; less than 10</li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wprestapiextensions/" target="_blank">WPRestApiExtensions</a> &#8211; less than 10</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With a few notable exceptions, most of these plugins are hovering around a range of 10 &#8211; 100 active installs. These low numbers may indicate that plugin authors have not yet readily embraced building with the scaffolding that was merged into core in 4.4. However, some developers who have embraced building with the API have opted not to offer their plugins and themes for large scale distribution on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the plugin directory is the wrong place to look for adoption,&#8221; WordPress developer <a href="https://twitter.com/natewr" target="_blank">Nate Wright</a> said at the most recent meeting. &#8220;As a plugin author myself, I have to bend over backwards to ensure compatibility with tens of thousands of weird plugins and themes. Javascript itself is highly unstable in the ecosystem because of all the terrible code out there. I&#8217;ve used the API in client projects and am currently integrating it with some customizer tools I&#8217;m building. My publicly available plugins will be the last thing I&#8217;ll introduce to the API.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Taylor Lovett, author of <a href="http://wptavern.com/custom-contact-forms-plugin-passes-1-million-downloads-on-wordpress-org" target="_blank">Custom Contact Forms</a>, believes that it&#8217;s important to get REST API-powered plugins into the hands of users, despite the support challenges of public distribution.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It pushes plugin and theme developers to start working around API JavaScript conflicts now,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;There are many plugins that conflict with the API for a variety of reasons, one of the big ones being modifying Backbone.sync. Having plugins use it now is painful but will push people to start reporting those JS conflicts.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Custom Contact Forms is currently the most widely-used plugin running the WP REST API with more than 70,000 installations, but the journey to using the current version has been fraught with challenges.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There have been a number of backwards compatibility breaks with the JSON REST API project,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;If I had known going into it what would happen, I probably would have not used the API.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am still not completely comfortable with using the API because of the perceived instability of the project,&#8221; he said.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, public distribution has brought Lovett considerable feedback from users which has been invaluable for his contributions to the REST API project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ve had a number of patches to the API that were discovered through Custom Contact Forms,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I’ve discovered some real edge cases while maintaining the API across more than 70K installations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Distributing his plugin on WordPress.org while the API went through significant changes was more challenging than Lovett anticipated, but through it the API has gained more exposure.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The faster the API is exposed to people and people get comfortable using it, the sooner we will see some major strides in applications being built around WordPress,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 05 Feb 2016 23:06:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"Matt: Chicken and Eggs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=46021";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"https://ma.tt/2016/02/chicken-and-eggs/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5798:"<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-46028" src="http://i2.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2016/02/mometablues.jpeg?resize=245%2C376" alt="mometablues.jpeg" />I&#8217;ve been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1455501352/">Questlove&#8217;s <em>Mo&#8217; Meta Blues</em></a>, and it’s an incredible education. The book is helping me appreciate an era of music that inspired the era that inspires me &#8212; the music that drove the Roots, J Dilla, Fugees, D’Angelo, Common, Erykah Badu, Kendrick Lamar, and so many more to create what they have.</p>\n<p>Chronologically, I’m in a chapter covering mid-90s hip-hop, which is full of conflict. There’s a tension alluded to in the book of the musicians that made it and those that didn’t: does increased radio play make songs popular? <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-repetition-can-turn-almost-anything-into-music">There&#8217;s some science that suggests yes</a>. Or is there something intrinsic to the record that puts it in that virtous loop of requests and airplay, the equivalent of usage and virality in a web product?</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a great ancedote in the book that I think is useful when thinking about products. All of the links are my addition, not in the original text.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There was one moment during the recording of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1ecv8bJajqX9E0EOX2g3eI"><em>Voodoo</em></a> that really brought this home. We were recording <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6GEykX11lQqp92UVOQQCC7">DJ Premier&#8217;s</a> scratches for &#8220;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3dOzhSPnBrRIcPyDUAqQYd">Devil&#8217;s Pie</a>,&#8221; and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3ZotbHeyVQKxQCPDJuQ4SU">Q-Tip</a> had just let the room to go work on something else, so there were four of us left there: Premier, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0IVcLMMbm05VIjnzPkGCyp">Dilla</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/336vr2M3Va0FjyvB55lJEd">D&#8217;Angelo</a>, and myself. During the break, Premier asked if anyone had any new shit to play for the group, and D&#8217;Angelo went for a cassette and played a bit of a new song, and the whole room just erupted in hooting. Then Dilla put on some new <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1020a42xVklY6c56imNcaa">Slum Village</a> shit and it was the same thing: an explosion of excitement. Then Premier, who had started the whole thing, played an <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/1BH45DVSTeGBvcYXNCd67g">M.O.P.</a> song and some new <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5cMgGlA1xGyeAB2ctYlRdZ">Gang Starr</a> material that he was working on for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6U2LlflINhafc0e9vhs0lp"><em>The Ownerz</em></a>.</p>\n<p>I was last at bat. All I had on me was a work tape for what would eventually become &#8220;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7frJEBqz0olVg8sQpXD5BF">Double Trouble</a>&#8221; on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0qbl8aNaCUOvX8HGsZYLfh"><em>Things Fall Apart</em></a>. It didn&#8217;t have finished vocals yet, didn&#8217;t have <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Mz5XE0kb1GBnbLQm2VbcO">Mos Def&#8217;s</a> verse. It was just a skeleton. I played it, and I will never forget the feeling that came over the room, including me. It wasn&#8217;t that they didn&#8217;t hoot and holler like they had for the other songs. They did. But they didn&#8217;t mean it. I know the move people resort to when they&#8217;re not quite into a song: they keep a straight stare on their face and bob their head a bit, not saying anything, not making eye contact. That&#8217;s the sign of death. That&#8217;s what they all did to me, and I felt humiliated. I was like Glenn Close in <em>Fatal Attraction</em>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzbVn9Xx3YM">I will not be ignored</a>! I went back into the studio that same night and gave that song a radical, extended facelift. I refused to sleep until I had that thing up and running.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I love the idea of Questlove realizing the song was missing something, and going back to the booth to keep working on it until it resonated with his target audience. A song that doesn’t stand up on its own wouldn’t be any better when bundled as part of an album. (Or Samsung would have the most popular apps on Android.) Fans hear the care and quality of each track, and they become super-fans. The bands that break out weren’t bludgeoned into fan’s ears by radio play, they were pulled by these passionate few into a wider audience.</p>\n<p>I love the mixtape culture that so many of today&#8217;s successful artists have come up through, and it is amplified online. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_discography#Mixtapes">Drake had three ever-improving mixtapes before his first album</a>.

There are a few outstanding issues with these four core objects, which the team wants to tackle via a feature plugin approach instead of holding the API back from merge. These outstanding items include things like password-protected posts, autosaves and post previews, and meta handling.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For now, we&#8217;re not going to support them, and will be working on them in a separate feature plugin instead,&#8221; WP REST API project lead Ryan McCue <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core-restapi/p1454628784001310" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;Again, this will be an enhancement to the API in the future, and doesn&#8217;t block compatibility here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In September 2015, McCue and contributors outlined <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/" target="_blank">a merge plan for the REST API</a> which brought the infrastructure into the 4.4 release with the endpoints on deck to follow one release later in 4.5. Contributors to the REST API believe that the project is still on track for this goal.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our proposal is that we ​merge the four core objects​ in the REST API with full read, create, update, delete support, with the more peripheral features to come ​when they&#8217;re ready,&#8221; McCue said.</p>\n<p>Several WordPress contributors, including project lead Matt Mullenweg, voiced concerns about the REST API shipping without the features that have been temporarily spun out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know it’s a minority opinion, but I would be pretty skeptical of merging a partial API into core,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;I think it would do a lot more damage than benefit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>McCue contended that the team has been working towards shipping a product that can be progressively enhanced.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The API is specifically structured around progressive enhancement, which is a key difference from many APIs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Allowing clients to detect features and support them when they&#8217;re ready allows us huge flexibility.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Does the WP REST API Need Full wp-admin Coverage?</h3>\n<p>Aaron Jorbin noted that while the four core object types allow for some innovative themes and content editors, they do not yet allow for full wp-admin replacements. This particular point was a deal breaker for several contributors attending the meeting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The cases where the current API covers today aren’t terribly interesting because they’re not really enabling something that was impossible to do before,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;It’s just a different approach to doing something that was already possible before. I don’t even think we have XML-RPC parity of feature support yet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wouldn’t have included REST examples in the SoTW, or encouraged plugins to use the scaffolding, or even let the scaffolding in the last release, if I didn’t think it was the most promising thing out there right now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But uptake definitely feels slower than I would have expected. It’s taken so long to get to this point, if we don’t pick up the pace, it could be another year or two before we get full wp-admin coverage.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that the <a href="http://wptavern.com/a-day-of-rest-conference-successful-81-would-attend-again" target="_blank">WP REST API recently had its own conference</a> dedicated to it, most of the people who are building with it are those who are also contributors on the project. Adoption is not yet widespread, but this could be due to the fact that many developers don&#8217;t want to build on it until the core endpoints are officially merged.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a bit of a chicken and egg: without core adoption, potential API consumers are hesitant to take the plunge, but without adoption it won&#8217;t be tested sufficiently to be merged,&#8221; REST API contributor K. Adam White said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From a project point of view I’m not really excited about shipping an API that has &#8216;some assembly required,&#8217; vs making the core release paired with interesting non-trivial killer apps (mobile apps, something calypso-like, big plugins using / supporting it),&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;To me a complete API is one that covers everything that’s possible within wp-admin. A subset of that is a partial API.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Multiple contributors on the REST API project, however, agreed that shipping with full admin replacement capability is unrealistic, especially after Mullenweg <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core-restapi/p1454632381001548" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that it should support everything possible in the admin, including the file editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re significantly more interested in getting read/write access to core types, so that we can interact with WP from a host of other platforms,&#8221; K. Adam White said. &#8220;I think that pushing everything off until it&#8217;s &#8216;Calpyso ready&#8217; blocks myriad use cases before they can get off the ground.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In response, Mullenweg asked why WordPress should support something in its web interface that isn&#8217;t supported through its official API. At the conclusion of the two-hour meeting he summarized his final proposal: &#8220;No partial endpoints in core. Let’s design a complete API, not half-do it and foist it on millions of sites,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>This is a critical juncture for the WP REST API project. While most contributors seemed agreed on further iterating the existing endpoints and ramping up usage before merging them into core, attendees remained divided about the need to have full wp-admin coverage prior to merge.</p>\n<p>WP REST API team members are squarely committed to iterating separately on peripheral features, but another contingent of WordPress contributors who joined the meeting yesterday are adamant about seeing a more polished API with better support for the admin. A plan forward has not yet emerged.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 05 Feb 2016 06:59:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"WPTavern: Pantheon Launches Community Resource for Scaling WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51157";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"http://wptavern.com/pantheon-launches-community-resource-for-scaling-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6075:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wordpress-at-scale.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51196"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wordpress-at-scale.png?resize=1025%2C406" alt="wordpress-at-scale" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51196" /></a></p>\n<p>When people ask the question, &#8220;Can WordPress scale?&#8221; they are often pointed to some of the largest websites running on WordPress, such as Time Magazine, TechCrunch, NBC Sports, Playstation, the New York Observer, and others. But how do you get there and what does it take to deliver WordPress at scale to millions of visitors?</p>\n<p>Yesterday <a href="https://pantheon.io/" target="_blank">Pantheon</a> launched a new resource to answer this question with a knowledge base of best practices from experienced developers. <a href="https://www.scalewp.io/" target="_blank">WordPress at Scale</a> is a community-driven project that aims to educate site owners and developers about scalable website infrastructure and optimizations that many large scale sites employ.</p>\n<p>The site&#8217;s content is managed via a <a href="https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wordpress-at-scale" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> where anyone can <a href="https://github.com/pantheon-systems/wordpress-at-scale/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">contribute</a>. Topics currently range from elastic architecture to object caching to recommended development workflows for scaling.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wordpress-at-scale-links.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51198"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/wordpress-at-scale-links.png?resize=1025%2C521" alt="wordpress-at-scale-links" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51198" /></a></p>\n<h3>Pantheon Aims to Make Scalability and Performance Commonly Understood Best Practices</h3>\n<p>&#8220;We work with a lot of web agencies and dev shops, and we’ve also spent a lot of time working within the community at WordCamps over the past 18 months,&#8221; Pantheon co-founder Josh Koenig said. &#8220;It definitely seems like there’s a need for go-to resources when it comes to questions about scale. We wanted to set a serious goal for ourselves to make an impact in the WordPress ecosystem.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While you can find scattered tutorials around the web about how to scale WordPress, this collaborative community effort is one of the first to aggregate resources into a collection. Knowledge of scalability doesn&#8217;t come easily and isn&#8217;t always shared with the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Very often learnings about scalability don’t make it out of projects or companies because they can be hard to generalize (or because people think there’s proprietary value in them),&#8221; Koenig said. &#8220;Our opinion — and this is based on our experience in the Drupal project with our pre-Pantheon work on PressFlow and ​<a href="https://www.chapterthree.com/blog/project-mercury-pre-configured-drupalvarnish-ec2-ami" target="_blank">Mercury</a> — is that there’s ​vastly more value to be had for everyone in making scalability and performance commonly understood best practices.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In order to accomplish this goal, Pantheon set up the WordPress at Scale microsite as a community project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We wanted this to be a real contribution,&#8221; Koenig said. &#8220;Since we’re a platform provider, doing it &#8216;in house&#8217; would mean it’s ultimately just a marketing piece.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m clearly being up front about the fact that we hope this site has marketing ​value​ to us, but that value should (rightly so) be proportional to how actually useful it is to the community,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We’d never get very far if this was just a Pantheon thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Weston Ruter, CTO at <a href="https://xwp.co/" target="_blank">XWP</a> and contributor to the WordPress at Scale site, agrees on the value of having the site set up as a community project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A community-driven resource like this is important because there is a lot to know, and there is a lot of experience to draw on from the community,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;No one agency or consultant has all of the possible tips and tricks for scaling WP, so having a collaborative resource to draw that information together is very helpful to keep it from being isolated in our respective silos.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although scaling varies widely based on the type of content being served and user activity on the site, many aspects of optimization are fairly straightforward and can be easily applied as needed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I suppose scaling WordPress is more a formula than an art,&#8221; Ruter said when asked which it resembles more. &#8220;If there is art to it, it is having an eye for designing the architecture to take into account the specifics of the site being scaled. Different sites have different techniques required for scaling.

The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/shiny-updates/" target="_blank">Shiny Updates</a> feature plugin was created to hide what project contributors refer to as the &#8220;The Bleak Screen of Sadness.”</p>\n<p>WordPress users received a small taste of shiny updates when the feature was applied to plugin updates in the 4.2 release, but themes still lag behind. For example, when you update a theme, WordPress lets you know exactly how hard it is working behind the scenes to make that happen:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Downloading update from https://downloads.wordpress.org/theme/cover.1.6.4.zip…</p>\n<p>Unpacking the update…</p>\n<p>Installing the latest version…</p>\n<p>Removing the old version of the theme…</p>\n<p>Theme updated successfully.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Shiny Updates hides the ugly parts of updates in favor of making the process appear more effortless. Instead of taking the user to a new screen, updates happen in the background without the need to refresh the page.</p>\n<p>The project is currently a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/" target="_blank">feature plugin</a> in development for WordPress core, led by Konstantin Obenland. In a recent <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/01/27/shiny-updates-v2/" target="_blank">status update</a> Obenland said that the new version of the plugin aims to extend shiny updates to all aspects of updates, installs, and deletes for plugins and themes in WordPress.</p>\n<p>Version 2 of the plugin currently offers the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deleting single plugins, bulk updating, and bulk deleting plugins from the plugin page.</li>\n<li>Shiny plugin installs from the plugin install screen: multiple actions can be queued up.</li>\n<li>Shiny theme installs, updates, and deletes, multiple queue-able, including multisite.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Development for the Shiny Updates project is happening on GitHub where the team is <a href="https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates/issues" target="_blank">collaborating on design and UX improvements</a>. One of their goals, according to the most recent update, is to refine the user experience by &#8220;improving perceived performance and limiting confusing notifications.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Update All the Things</h3>\n<p>WordPress&#8217; update process is somewhat fragmented when there are multiple updates available for core, plugins, and themes on the <em>update-core.php</em> screen. Shiny Updates contributors are exploring <a href="https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates/issues/5" target="_blank">a button that would &#8220;update all the things&#8221;</a> in one pass. The dedicated issue on GitHub has 28 comments of discussion and design mockups for what an &#8220;<em>Update All</em>&#8221; process might look like.</p>\n<p>In addition to adding an <em>Update All</em> functionality, contributors are also working on the following issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Development for <a href="https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates/issues/7" target="_blank">bulk plugin action notifications</a></li>\n<li>Design for <a href="https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates/issues/54" target="_blank">updating themes from the theme card</a> (on top of from details modal)</li>\n<li>Another round of user tests to get more feedback on the new flows</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When asked whether Shiny Updates will be ready for inclusion in the upcoming 4.5 release, Obenland said, &#8220;Even though we’re fairly far into what we want to accomplish with v2, there are still a good number of tasks outstanding.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m going to reach out to the a11y group for a review soon and have already gotten in touch with a few core committers to have the JS part reviewed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We’re also in the process of running more user tests for the new flows. So the decision deadline next week just comes a little too early.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At this time, WordPress 4.6 is a more likely target for including Shiny Updates in core. If you want to assist the team in getting it ready, install the feature plugin from the official directory or via the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/" target="_blank">Beta Tester</a> plugin. Testing version 2 should include both plugin and theme installation, update, and delete actions on both single and multisite installs. Testers can report any bugs to the project&#8217;s GitHub <a href="https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates/issues" target="_blank">issues queue</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 04 Feb 2016 00:56:58 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"Post Status: The first WordPress REST API conference, in review";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=20387";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"https://poststatus.com/a-day-of-rest-review/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24660:"<p>January 28th and 29th of 2016 marked the first ever <a href="https://feelingrestful.com/">A Day of REST</a>, a conference devoted to the WordPress REST API. It&#8217;s also, to my knowledge, the first ever conference completely about a single feature of WordPress.</p>\n<p>Put on by the <a href="https://hmn.md/">Human Made</a> team, there were definitely risks: maybe not enough people would sign up, maybe the content would be too dense, or not dense enough for the audience that showed, maybe the API wouldn&#8217;t be in core yet, and more. Yet, none of these things happened, and the conference was a success.</p>\n<p>I had the privilege to cover the event as the media partner, and I had an excellent time. It wasn&#8217;t a small conference, with over 220 attendees, but it was intimate, utilizing a single track setup, and had a small hack day reserved for 40 people.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20447" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ador-poststatus-20-752x501.jpg" alt="ador-poststatus-20" width="752" height="501" /></p>\n<p>It was also a bit of a risk to host the first A Day of REST in London, where it was quite accessible to the European community, but out of reach for much of the American market. Nonetheless, those of us that came from the US, Asia, and elsewhere were able to make mini-vacations of the conference, and the UK and broader European community made a great showing; the event nearly sold out.</p>\n<h3>Why does the WordPress REST API merit its own conference?</h3>\n<p>The <a href="http://wp-api.org/">WordPress REST API</a> drastically changes the landscape for WordPress development. Now, WordPress can be the data store, while other technologies can (but aren&#8217;t required to, of course) take up pretty much every other aspect of the website. The front end and the back end components of a website can utilize completely custom web stacks, while the data is stored in WordPress.</p>\n<p>The API can be used for modules within existing sites built traditionally with WordPress, or as the engine for entire external web apps. There are so many potential avenues to take WordPress with the REST API, that exploring just a few of them merits a conference like this. In fact, after having seen the conference, I feel that we just scratched the surface. That said, it was an excellent day, where I learned a lot. Here&#8217;s an overview of each speaker, and be on the lookout for videos as well, which will be hosted here on Post Status.</p>\n<h3>Introduction to the WordPress REST API</h3>\n<p>At A Day of REST, we were guided from the beginning, with an introduction to APIs within WordPress, and the role the REST API will play, by WordPress REST API Lead Developer Ryan McCue.</p>\n<div id="attachment_20461" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-20461" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ador-poststatus-6-752x501.jpg" alt="Ryan McCue" width="752" height="501" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ryan McCue</p></div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rmccue/a-day-of-rest-2016">Ryan&#8217;s slides</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://twitter.com/rmccue">Ryan on Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://ryanmccue.info/">Ryan&#8217;s website</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Building Blocks of a REST API project</h3>\n<p>Next, Joe Hoyle &#8212; a core member of the REST API team, Human Made CTO, and my co-host on the Draft podcast &#8212; walked us through the building blocks of a REST API project.</p>\n<div id="attachment_20457" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-20457 size-large" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ador-poststatus-10-752x501.jpg" alt="ador-poststatus-10" width="752" height="501" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Joe Hoyle</p></div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://feelingrestful.com/speakers/89">Joe&#8217;s slides</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle">Joe on Twitter</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://joehoyle.co.uk/">Joe&#8217;s website</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Unlock the Potential of the WP REST API at the Command Line</h3>\n<p>Next, Daniel Bachhuber talked about creating a more RESTful wp-cli.

Human Made is talking to potential partners (and in disclosure, I&#8217;m in these discussions as well) about potential events in the United States and Asia so far.</p>\n<p>Feedback from A Day of REST was quite positive: more than 80% of attendees would definitely attend again, and nobody said they would definitely <em>not</em> attend again. For many, the depth of the talks and willingness for the conference to go deep on one WordPress feature was welcome, especially because this was an advanced audience of mostly developers, and not all just WordPress developers.</p>\n<p>More than 20% of attendees consider themselves primarily JavaScript developers. I imagine the other 80% are all seeking to learn more about JavaScript, especially in context of its uses with the WordPress REST API, and considering Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s challenge during the <a href="https://poststatus.com/state-of-the-word-2015/">most recent State of the Word</a>.</p>\n<p>I imagine we will also be seeing stronger focus on the REST API at larger WordCamps. I could imagine simultaneous developer tracks and REST API tracks. And third party events like A Day of REST can go even deeper, with workshops and smaller group teaching, versus only speaker-driven events.</p>\n<p>I love seeing people get together and learn. A Day of REST was productive, educational, and fun. I look forward to potential future iterations of this event, and getting back to Europe for a proper vacation (this was my first trip there!). Keep an eye out on Post Status for the official videos, and a round table podcast where I talked to many of the speakers about the WordPress REST API.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 03 Feb 2016 22:45:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"WPTavern: A Day of REST Conference Successful, 81% Would Attend Again";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51127";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://wptavern.com/a-day-of-rest-conference-successful-81-would-attend-again";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5606:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/a-day-of-rest.jpeg" rel="attachment wp-att-51128"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/a-day-of-rest.jpeg?resize=1000%2C531" alt="photo credit: Noel Tock" class="size-full wp-image-51128" /></a>photo credit: Noel Tock\n<p>Last weekend more than 200 developers gathered in London for a niche conference devoted to the WordPress REST API. <a href="https://feelingrestful.com/" target="_blank">A Day of REST</a> featured speakers from around the world who are building applications with the REST API at companies like WIRED, The New York Times, Fusion, Automattic, and Bocoup.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The conference was a fantastic proof of just how popular the REST API project is, and it was super encouraging to see everyone there to hear about it,&#8221; Ryan McCue told the Tavern. McCue, a co-lead on the WP REST API project, said he enjoyed the opportunity to connect with the many developers who are already using the API in production. He also said he was surprised by some of the the speakers&#8217; unconventional uses of the API, including using it to supply content from WordPress to <a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank">Ghost</a> themes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The contributor day was wildly successful as we took a feature plugin approach to some long-standing issues,&#8221; McCue said. &#8220;We essentially split the room into six and let every team handle their tasks with fresh eyes. A huge amount of progress was made, and I&#8217;m hoping that this greater ownership of the contributions will encourage contributors to remain involved well into the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>McCue said three quarters of the WP REST API leadership team had the opportunity to meet in person and work through nearly all of their outstanding discussion items to get unblocked for future work.</p>\n<p>In addition to being a boon to the REST API project, the conference was inspirational for developers who appreciated the in-depth technical focus of the event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the most exciting point for me was the realization that the potential of decoupling WordPress from its codebase is far more complete and powerful than I had previously thought,&#8221; said Adam Hollister, an engineer who <a href="https://www.pragmatic-web.co.uk/a-day-of-rest/" target="_blank">attended with colleagues from Pragmatic</a>, a UK-based development agency. &#8220;I’m looking forward to building something with WordPress data in a way that would not have been possible until now.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Human Made Embraces Challenge of Hosting Conferences Curated for Developers</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/a-day-of-rest-jack-lennox.jpeg" rel="attachment wp-att-51148"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/a-day-of-rest-jack-lennox.jpeg?resize=956%2C535" alt="a-day-of-rest-jack-lennox" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51148" /></a></p>\n<p>As many WordCamps are becoming more user-focused, developers are looking for events where they can expand their skills and learn from others in the industry. According to Day of REST stats from co-organizer Petya Raykovska, 41% of the 221 attendees were WordPress developers, 26% PHP developers, 21% JavaScript developers, and 12% other attendees (designers, product managers, and business owners).</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s more challenging to organize a niche conference than it is to organize a WordCamp,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;From the start we wanted to throw a very high quality event, especially curated for developers who want to improve the level of their work. That meant a very precise speaker selection for that particular audience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The organization team at <a href="https://hmn.md/" target="_blank">Human Made</a> wanted the conference to teach and inspire at the same time. Raykovska said that balancing the schedule to achieve this goal was one of their biggest challenges.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the end we are incredibly proud of the lineup of speakers we had and the feedback we’ve been getting from attendees showed that people loved our speakers,&#8221; she said.

But where most people list prior jobs, these applications (and LinkedIn profiles) list projects. When you dig into prior jobs listed, if there are any, they&#8217;re typically in a completely unrelated field like medicine or finance, and under education they list one of these new bootcamps, like Hack Reactor or App Acedemy.</p>\n<p>Here I&#8217;m going to offer a key <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f511.png" alt="🔑" class="wp-smiley" />piece of advice to these folks to help their applications stand out, and can 100% compensate for their lack of professional experience: <strong>contribute to open source</strong>. &#8220;Projects&#8221; done in a coding bootcamp, even when they&#8217;re spelled out in great bullet-point technical detail, don&#8217;t really tell me anything about your engineering ability. Open source contributions show me a passion for a given area, ability to work with others to have a contribution reviewed and accepted, and most importantly show actual code. Even better than one-off contributions, if you can grow into a recognized position in an open source project, that puts you ten steps ahead of applications even from folks with 20 years experience in the field, at least to an Open Source-biased company like Automattic.</p>\n<p>Though I don&#8217;t know any of these boot camps well enough to suggest them, I love the idea in general. Even before the more formal bootcamps I&#8217;ve seen hundreds of examples of people who used free information and technology to rise to a very high level of technical contribution. In fact that&#8217;s very much my own story from the early days of WordPress. So in summary: it&#8217;s okay to learn to code through class projects, but show your value by getting involved in something bigger.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 01 Feb 2016 16:00:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"WPTavern: In Case You Missed It – Issue 2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://wptavern.com?p=51094&preview_id=51094";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"http://wptavern.com/in-case-you-missed-it-issue-2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9722:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICYMIFeaturedImage.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50955"><img class="size-full wp-image-50955" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICYMIFeaturedImage.png?resize=676%2C292" alt="In Case You Missed It Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/112901923@N07/16153818039">Night Moves</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of great WordPress content published in the community but not all of it is featured on the Tavern.

While it&#8217;s great to give back to WordPress, Robinkoff reminds us that we need to invest in ourselves before reinvesting in WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Without giving back to ourselves, giving to the WordPress project would suffer. Invest in the wellness of WordPress by investing in yourself.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Robinkoff is also working on a side project called <a href="http://wpambassador.com/">WPAmbassador.com</a>, a site that aims to bring people together. It will promote camaraderie and wellness throughout the community. It&#8217;s not ready yet but it may launch in February.</p>\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t get a chance to attend or watch his presentation at WordCamp US, I highly encourage you to do so.

The company used password-protected Prologue sites to allow employees to keep track of projects and updates.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/PrologueScreenshot.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51096"><img class="size-full wp-image-51096" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/PrologueScreenshot.png?resize=560%2C342" alt="Prologue in Action" /></a>Prologue in Action\n<p>In March of 2009, <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2009/03/11/p2-the-new-prologue/">Automattic released P2</a>, the successor to Prologue. In 2014, the company transitioned internal sites to <a href="http://geto2.com/">o2, </a>successor to P2 and <a href="http://wptavern.com/o2-is-now-available-on-github">open sourced</a> its code in 2015.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t Read The Comments</h2>\n<p>Anil Dash <a href="https://medium.com/@anildash/against-don-t-read-the-comments-aee43ce515b9#.r110p33yi">published a great post</a> on Medium that looks at the phrase, &#8220;Don&#8217;t read the comments.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’ve made a habit out of telling people not to read the comments online. But what started as a cynical in-joke has become a bad habit, and an excuse for enabling abuse across the web.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s a phrase I&#8217;ve seen many people say on Twitter referencing comments to articles published on the Tavern. Dash goes on to say, &#8220;Preventing abuse online requires the people running a site or an app to invest time, effort and attention into protecting their community. That’s the bottom line.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is one of the reasons why we created a <a href="http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy">comment moderation policy</a> and are taking a more active role this year moderating comments. However, in recent weeks, I&#8217;ve noticed some of the same people who said the phrase above are now engaging in the conversation which is helping to calm the waters.</p>\n<p>For those thinking about disabling comments or need a reminder as to why their important, considering the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There’s a grave cost to assuming online interactivity is always awful. The burden is felt most acutely in denying opportunity to those for whom connecting to a community online may be the only way to get a foot in the door. Those underrepresented, unheard voices are the most valuable ones we lose when we throw the baby out with the bathwater and assume online comments are necessarily bad.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>This Week in Core</h2>\n<p>If you want to keep a close eye on WordPress core development, there&#8217;s no better way than reading <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/week-in-core/">This Week in Core</a>.

In the post, he explains some of the responsibilities his role entails.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are many compelling stories to tell.

The growth comes from eCommerce, publishing, membership sites, inbound marketers etc. These are all users that can benefit from being service providers.</p>\n<p>I think that those of us who empower these users by giving them the tools needed to make their sites have to think API first. Your plugin’s interaction with the client is going to be more and more coming through the API.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content"><p><a href="http://joshpress.net/how-wp-api-changes-wordpress-plugin-development/">How The WordPress REST API Changes WordPress Plugin Development</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Is WordPress Made of Spaghetti Code?</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been around the WordPress ecosystem for any length of time, you&#8217;ve likely run into a conversation or two where someone says WordPress&#8217; code is a mess. On the <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/is-wordpress-code-really-a-mess/">Kinsta blog</a>, Daniel Pataki takes a hard look at what bad code is, whether or not users care, and if it&#8217;s a legitimate reason to avoid using WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Wapuutah!</h2>\n<p>In what is a traditional part of this series, I end each issue featuring a Wapuu design.

The link is usually available via the plugin or theme&#8217;s page on WordPress.org. If you&#8217;ve discovered a useful plugin, consider giving the author a monetary donation.</p>\n<p>Another way to thank plugin and theme authors is to rate and review their work.

A side effect of rating and reviewing plugins and themes, is that it’s one of many ways to contribute back to WordPress.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/BillionThanksFeaturedImage.png" rel="attachment wp-att-34331"><img class="size-full wp-image-34331" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/BillionThanksFeaturedImage.png?resize=796%2C267" alt="Billion Thanks Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/opensourceway/7007768456/">opensourceway</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">WordPress theme directory</a> has more than 2k themes while the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">plugin directory</a> has nearly 47k plugins.

One time, I was the ​<strong>seventh</strong>​ developer on a project, but I was the first paid one and the one to launch the site.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So many of the problems these projects run into are in the very early stages where they went all in with a bad theme, picked the wrong plugin, or quite commonly, didn&#8217;t think through or understand their organization&#8217;s needs and how those should translate to a website,&#8221; Root-Wiley told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>Instead of publishing the information in an e-book, he used WordPress, &#8220;I chose to publish it as a website because I think that&#8217;s the most user-friendly format and I don&#8217;t want anything to get in the way with people accessing the information,&#8221; Root-Wiley said.</p>\n<p>While he doesn&#8217;t plan to open source the site anytime soon, people can submit content suggestions and ideas through the site&#8217;s <a href="http://nonprofitwp.org/about/contact/">contact form</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 22:23:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"WPTavern: First WordPress Meetup in Karachi Draws 125 Attendees";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51051";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://wptavern.com/first-wordpress-meetup-in-karachi-draws-125-attendees";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2907:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karachi-wordpress-meetup.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-51057"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/karachi-wordpress-meetup.jpg?resize=1025%2C532" alt="karachi-wordpress-meetup" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51057" /></a></p>\n<p>The WordPress community in Karachi, Pakistan held its first meetup last weekend led by <a href="https://twitter.com/sewabs" target="_blank">Waseem Abbas</a>. The gathering drew 125 attendees and organizers have been receiving <a href="https://www.facebook.com/s.wasim.abbas/posts/1064760890225282?pnref=story" target="_blank">positive reviews and feedback</a>.</p>\n<p>The meetup featured two sessions, one on &#8220;WordPress Security&#8221; by Ahsan Parwez and the second on &#8220;WordPress Possibilities&#8221; by Usman Khalid. I spoke with Abbas who said that organizers were surprised by the depth of WordPress knowledge among the attendees.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were expecting a beginner level audience,&#8221; Abbas said. &#8220;But when they started asking questions of the speakers, we were amazed. It is clear now that we should have more advanced discussions in future meetups. For the smaller beginner audience, we will be focusing on short live sessions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Karachi, with a population of 25 million people, is one of the largest cities in the world. Pakistan&#8217;s WordPress community is growing rapidly, as evidenced by the <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-growing-in-pakistan-500-attend-lahore-meetup" target="_blank">local meetup in Lahore that recently passed 500 attendees</a>. Karachi is five times the size of Lahore and has the potential to be home to a much larger WordPress community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Pakistan is ranked 3rd on <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/" target="_blank">freelancer.com</a> and most of the projects are based on WordPress,&#8221; Abbas said. &#8220;It shows how people are using WordPress to change their lives in Pakistan. Many of the big WordPress companies have employees working from Pakistan.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Feedback from both Lahore and Karachi organizers indicates that the WordPress community in Pakistan is extensive, but 2015 and 2016 are the first years that leaders have emerged to get everyone connected.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People are working on different WordPress projects and websites professionally but are not connected with each other,&#8221; Abbas said. &#8220;WordPress is used by hundreds of bloggers and developers, but they don&#8217;t have a platform to connect.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After this meetup we have seen many business collaborations and idea sharing in the community,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is a positive gesture and real motivation for us to scale the meetups in future.&#8221; The next Karachi meetup is scheduled for February 27th.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 00:19:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"WPTavern: Your Chance to Give Feedback on WordPress’ Accessibility Coding Standards";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=51041";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"http://wptavern.com/your-chance-to-give-feedback-on-wordpress-accessibility-coding-standards";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4377:"<p>The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/">WordPress Accessibility team</a> is seeking feedback on a draft that outlines <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/accessibility-coding-standards/">accessibility coding standards</a> for WordPress core. According to the draft, new features should meet the accessibility guidelines before merging into core.</p>\n<blockquote><p>All code released in WordPress must conform with the WCAG 2.0 guidelines at level AA. These basic guidelines are intended for easy reference during development, but do not cover all possible accessibility issues.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While the document focuses on core, it&#8217;s also a great reference for developers who want their themes and plugins more accessible.</p>\n<h2>Matt Mullenweg Addresses WordPress&#8217; Accessibility</h2>\n<p>For the second year in a row, <a href="http://mor10.com/">Morten Rand-Hendriksen</a>, an advocate for improving WordPress&#8217; accessibility, brought up the topic during the Q&amp;A portion of the 2015 State of the Word.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Hendriksen notes that in 2014, the WordPress theme directory <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-suck-at-accessibility-its-time-to-fix-it">contained 14 themes</a> with the accessibility-ready tag. In 2015, that number increased to 79.</p>\n<p>Hendriksen brings up the fact that when WordPress adopts modern technologies, so does most of the web citing responsive images as an example. He asks Mullenweg if WordPress can do the same for accessibility in which the audience responds with applause. Mullenweg responds with a simple yes.</p>\n<h2>Thinking of Accessibility as Just a Checkbox</h2>\n<p>Hendriksen then asks a follow-up question, &#8220;Can you tell everyone in this room and community that when they learn JavaScript, to also add on that little accessibility part, so that we&#8217;re building everything accessible and tell the world that the web should be accessible and that&#8217;s the WordPress way?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg responds by agreeing the web should be accessible but says, &#8220;I&#8217;m worried about getting to a point where we think of accessibility like a checkbox. Even though there are great guidelines and things like that, I think that accessibility is a process and it&#8217;s going to be driven sometimes not by every single person, but by groups like the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/">amazing accessibility team</a> and most importantly by the people who need the technology, communicating, and us observing that.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So, I do think that we have presentations on accessibility at every single WordCamp, we have the accessibility guidelines online but I think we&#8217;re a little behind on the theme reviews which is part of the reason the number hasn&#8217;t grown as much because the accessibility reviews are more difficult than a standard review, but I&#8217;m really excited about what this group has been able to do and the growing momentum it&#8217;s gained in the WordPress world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that saying I want things to be accessible moves things forward as much as the continuing education that we&#8217;re doing through every single WordCamp, the guidelines, and the group,&#8221; Mullenweg said. He also highlights the need to think of accessibility in a global sense.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think about the 6.99 billion people who haven&#8217;t used WordPress yet and many of those who can&#8217;t. I also think about accessibility in terms of languages and touch devices.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These are things that as we get there, what we do right can expand to a larger audience. I encourage everyone to keep that in mind, but learn JavaScript as well,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s responses reinforce the fact that accessibility remains a priority for the WordPress project.

By day he is a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.ca.com/us/default.aspx" target="_blank">CA Technologies</a> in Raleigh, working in React/Redux, Node, ElasticSearch, Grails, and Groovy. But at night he is busy building <a href="https://kernl.us/" target="_blank">Kernl</a>, a service that provides private plugin and theme updates for WordPress.</p>\n<p>Once a plugin has been added to the service, the updates delivered from Kernl will look exactly like updates from WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Kernl’s core feature is providing private plugin and theme updates for WordPress developers. However, our differentiating features are what get me excited,&#8221; Slingerland said. &#8220;We have purchase code validation (so only authorized users can download updates) and continuous integration (CI) support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The CI stuff is really neat, because it allows WP developers to push their code into GitHub or BitBucket and then have it automatically packaged and deployed to their customers. CI has been traditionally hard to do on WordPress because your ‘production’ environment is often something you don’t control,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Kernl solves that problem.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The idea for Kernl came to Slingerland after previous years trudging through client work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One thing that constantly nagged at me was how hard it was to get any bug fixes or feature updates out to my clients,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I often didn’t manage their sites, so getting them updates involved lots of emailing and communication overhead.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I originally had the idea for Kernl back in 2011, but never executed on it until last year,&#8221; Slingerland said. &#8220;I was hoping that I could help other people solve the same problem I had.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kernl launched in private alpha in May 2015 with ~65 alpha users. In November he opened it up for public beta and the service now has approximately 100 beta users. Testers are currently putting Kernl through its paces:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kernl hosts 73 plugins &#038; 43 themes (117 total)</li>\n<li>The service processed 4.07 million update checks since May</li>\n<li>Kernl processes around ~2 update status checks / second</li>\n<li>14,100 updates have been downloaded from Kernl</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How does Kernl compare to WP Pusher?</h3>\n<p>I asked Slingerland about how Kernl measures up to <a href="https://wppusher.com/" target="_blank">WP Pusher</a>, which allows developers to deploy WordPress themes and plugins from GitHub and Bitbucket.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Kernl doesn’t require your end-user to install anything besides your plugin/theme,&#8221; Slinglerland said. &#8220;If I understand WP Pusher correctly, you first install WP Pusher, then tell WP Pusher to manage updates for a given plugin/theme via it’s version control repository. But this has to happen on every end user installation and might feel complicated to non-technical users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Kernl works seamlessly with your plugin/theme, just like those that are installed from the WordPress.org repository.  This makes installing and updating feel familiar and blend in seamlessly,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We also have purchase code validation, which is going to be getting some love and an API after we go live.  Kernl also supports versioning your plugin/theme, so intermediary commits don’t get randomly sent out to your customers.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Importance of Continuous Integration</h3>\n<p>One of the reasons Slingerland built Kernl is because he wants to help more WordPress developers add continuous integration to their workflows. This particular aspect of the app (the &#8220;push to build&#8221; feature) posed the biggest technical challenge but was one of the most important problems for Kernl to solve.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are a lot of edge-cases that I didn’t foresee, especially once I started integrating with both BitBucket and GitHub,&#8221; Slingerland said. &#8220;In these cases the beta testers were invaluable in helping ferret out bugs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having a solid continuous integration and deployment workflow really changes the way you think about development,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Instead of having &#8216;big bang&#8217; once a quarter feature releases, it becomes easier to iterate on your idea. Fail fast, validate your ideas/changes, and iterate again. It’s a big enabler of the Agile development methodology, and I feel that the WordPress plugin/theme community has kind of lacked that. It encourages good testing as well, which is almost required if you are deploying continuously.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Slingerland is aiming Kernl at developers who create WordPress plugins and themes that are not hosted on WordPress.org. A handful of his beta users have even been using the service to distribute updates for their own beta testers before they publish an official release to WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>Kernl will host any plugin or theme for free as long as it is both open source and freely available. Pricing for commercial plugins and themes will range from $5 &#8211; $25/month. The service is free to use during the beta period, which is planned to be wrapped up in mid-February.</p>\n<h3>Kernl Will Not Police Product Licensing</h3>\n<p>After further inquiry regarding Kernl&#8217;s position on the licensing of products it hosts, Slingerland states that he will not police his customers&#8217; licensing. This means that authors of non-GPL themes and plugins would be welcome to distribute their software via his platform. Since themes and plugins are derivative works of WordPress, they are required to be licensed under the GPL.</p>\n<p>Slingerland&#8217;s lack of willingness to police non-GPL software has the potential to make Kernl a hive for products that break WordPress&#8217; license. The service makes it easy to distribute non-GPL software that masquerades in the admin as regular compliant plugins/themes when it comes to updates.</p>\n<p>Distributing non-GPL software can be a deal breaker for WordPress developers who feel strongly about the GPL. The GPL protects users&#8217; freedom to use and modify the software for any purpose, and many developers have built their businesses and reputations on upholding that freedom.</p>\n<p>Software hosted by Kernl may or may not comply with GPL licensing, and the user may never know. This leaves the user vulnerable in a way that official updates from WordPress.org does not. Developers who don&#8217;t want to be parcel to supporting a platform that has the potential to distribute non-GPL software may want to look for an alternative.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 18:44:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Matt: Minsky";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=45808";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://ma.tt/2016/01/minsky/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:455:"<p>Very sad to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/26/business/marvin-minsky-pioneer-in-artificial-intelligence-dies-at-88.html">hear that Marvin Minsky has passed</a>.

Most of the major payment gateways are offered at $79 per single site license. There are also <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=woocommerce" target="_blank">hundreds of additional extensions</a> hosted on WordPress.org, including several payment gateway plugins that, if listed on the WooCommerce site, would be in direct competition to its major money makers.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/paypal-for-woocommerce/" target="_blank">PayPal for WooCommerce</a> is one such competitor. It adds PayPal Express Checkout, Payments Pro, and PayPal Plus (for Germany) to WooCommerce in a single, completely free plugin. It also utilizes all of the features PayPal provides in its APIs for seamless integration with WooCommerce. The plugin is active on more than 10,000 sites and has a 4.8/5.0 star rating on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.angelleye.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Angell</a> developed PayPal for WooCommerce after finding inadequacies in the leading plugin options at the time. Prior to creating the plugin, Angell spent many years becoming a PayPal specialist, earning much of his income taking PayPal-related development projects. He is now a PayPal Partner, certified PayPal developer, <a href="https://www.angelleye.com/paypal-developer-certified-award-winner/" target="_blank">3-time PayPal Star Developer award winner</a>, and a PayPal Ambassador.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I first started learning how to work with web services around the time PayPal had just released their first set of public APIs,&#8221; Angell said. &#8220;Payment processing was very important to my general web development work, of course, so I took the time to learn how to tightly integrate the PayPal API, which really taught me how to work with pretty much any API at that point. During this time I spent a lot of time in PayPal developer forums.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As PayPal introduced a wide variety of different API products over the years, Angell was able to become familiar with them one at a time as they were released. He spent a good deal of time providing free support to people looking for help with PayPal development on StackOverflow, which led to a seemingly never-ending supply of PayPal-specific client work and eventually a partnership with PayPal that pays him a revenue share based on the volume of transactions processed through their platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For a long time I was just another web developer that was using the PayPal forums as a way to generate work and prestige for the &#8220;angelleye&#8221; name,&#8221; Angell said. &#8220;The vast majority of the work that was coming to me was WordPress / WooCommerce type work where people wanted help getting PayPal working the way they want. My primary business model was to sell websites and custom jobs, and the PayPal revenue share was a nice little bonus on that.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a general developer/user myself, when I would get these jobs I was thinking, oh great, Woo provides premium extensions for Express Checkout, Payments Pro, etc,&#8221; Angell said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just buy those and we&#8217;ll use those in these projects to keep the time/cost down for my client.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I started doing this, though, I quickly saw that while the Woo community builds a great shopping cart, they left much to be desired in the specific area of PayPal payment integration. Their plugins were missing lots of little features PayPal provides that are useful, and the error catching wasn&#8217;t done well, so successful payments could actually be flagged as failures, and other little things like that were just wrong. I found myself spending so much time extending/customizing their plugins that I just decided I needed to build my own. That&#8217;s how PayPal for WooCommerce was born,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/paypal-for-woocommerce.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50993"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/paypal-for-woocommerce.png?resize=1025%2C331" alt="paypal-for-woocommerce" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50993" /></a></p>\n<p>Angell&#8217;s first official WordPress plugin was a success, thanks to the popularity of WooCommerce as well as PayPal&#8217;s <a href="https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/payments/" target="_blank">67% market share</a> among payment gateways.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because many others were experiencing the same struggles I was with Woo&#8217;s extensions, it [PayPal for WooCommerce] quickly became popular on its own &#8211; enough that it completely changed my business model,&#8221; Angell said. &#8220;I am now entirely focused on building tools like this, giving them away for free, and generating as much volume as I can.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/paypal-plugins.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50996"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/paypal-plugins.png?resize=245%2C300" alt="paypal-plugins" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-50996" /></a>Angell and his team are starting to play with the premium extension models that WooCommerce and many others use, but he said that PayPal for WooCommerce will always be completely free.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our PayPal IPN for WordPress and our Offers for WooCommerce, though, do have some premium extensions that we&#8217;ll be selling licenses for, and we&#8217;ll continue to build on that as well as maintaining our free stuff,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<h3>A Non-Traditional Way of Monetizing a Free WordPress Product</h3>\n<p>Traditionally, the WordPress freemium product business model creates revenue by selling commercial licenses and support. With payment gateways it&#8217;s a little different because revenue sharing offers a more lucrative business opportunity. In this scenario it&#8217;s best if the product is free, although it still requires updates, support, and a reputation for reliability.</p>\n<p>Angell would not share with us his exact cut from the PayPal partnership program but said it&#8217;s only a fraction of a percent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any way to see exactly what this one plugin generated for us, but I can tell you that the combination of all the tools we have processed a total of $207 million in 2015,&#8221; Angell said. &#8220;PayPal for WooCommerce is by far our most popular tool, but we do have about 10 other tools that are helping with those numbers as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Maintaining a payment gateway by staying current with changes to the PayPal API is a ton of work. Add to that the burden of support for 10,000+ active installations, and WooCommerce for PayPal could be a full-time job. The revenue share business model makes supporting this free plugin worthwhile.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The model is just nicer for me because I can simply support the product instead of having so many clients breathing down my neck with deadlines,&#8221; Angell said. &#8220;I simply make sure I respond quickly to people in the support forums and fix bugs in the plugins whenever necessary as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because of the quality development and our expertise in ensuring PayPal is integrated well, we really don&#8217;t have a lot of issues keeping up with support. Most of the bug reports we get involve conflicts with other plugins, so as long as I make sure our stuff continues to work with new updates of WordPress and WooCommerce we can generally get through our days stress free,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have definitely thought about building similar extensions for other plugins like GravityForms, etc. but we&#8217;re still in growth stages here and aren&#8217;t working with a very big budget,&#8221; Angell said. &#8220;Only myself and one other developer are managing all of these tools right now, and that&#8217;s on top of all the client work we still have and do on a regular basis just because we didn&#8217;t want to kill relationships with good clients.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Angell and his team also benefit from keeping PayPal for WooCommerce open source and freely <a href="https://github.com/angelleye/paypal-woocommerce" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a>, where they can receive contributions and bug reports for improvements. Since the business model doesn&#8217;t revolve around selling licenses and limiting the number of sites that can use them, there&#8217;s no need to keep the code locked up.</p>\n<p>The model also works out well for the users, who receive a high quality plugin and support for free as opposed to paying <a href="https://www.woothemes.com/products/paypal-pro/" target="_blank">$79 for a single license of PayPal Pro</a> or $199 for up to 25 sites. PayPal for WooCommerce, on the other hand, can be used on an unlimited number of sites for free.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 21:59:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"WPTavern: First Global WordPress Contributor Drive Set For January 30-31, 2016";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50974";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"http://wptavern.com/first-global-wordpress-contributor-drive-set-for-january-30-31-2016";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2385:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WCSFContributorDayFeaturedImage.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-14814"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14814" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/WCSFContributorDayFeaturedImage.jpg?resize=650%2C200" alt="WordCamp San Francisco Contributor Day Featured Image" /></a>I know a lot of people in the community who got their start answering questions in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/">WordPress support forums</a>.

While a number of WordCamps have a day set aside for attendees to contribute back to WordPress, not everyone has one nearby they can attend. The first drive is focused on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/support">Support Team</a> which answers questions in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support">support forums</a>.</p>\n<p>The drives are composed of challenges that take place over the course of a weekend to give people in different time zones an opportunity to participate. On this drive, contributors are challenged to answer 20 support requests in the forums.</p>\n<p>While individuals can participate, it&#8217;s a lot more fun to do so as a group. Participants are encouraged to work with people from their local meetup group. If this isn&#8217;t feasible, join the <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/forums/">#forums channel</a> on Slack where moderators will be standing by to provide guidance to new contributors.</p>\n<p>WordPress has an amazing world-wide community and if 30 people complete the challenge, 600 threads will be responded too. Initiatives like this are a great idea and an excellent opportunity for new contributors to get their feet wet.</p>\n<p>For more details and directions on how to participate, please view the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/support/20-questions/">guide to contributor weekend</a>.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 19:28:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"WPTavern: In Case You Missed It – Issue 1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50935";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"http://wptavern.com/in-case-you-missed-it-issue-1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6878:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICYMIFeaturedImage.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50955"><img class="size-full wp-image-50955" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICYMIFeaturedImage.png?resize=676%2C292" alt="In Case You Missed It Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/112901923@N07/16153818039">Night Moves</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of great WordPress content published in the community but not all of it is featured on the Tavern. Starting today and every Friday, I&#8217;ll share an assortment of items related to WordPress that caught my eye but didn&#8217;t make it into a full post.</p>\n<h2>Beyond Imagination by Dustin Filippini</h2>\n<p>Dustin Filippini, <span class="st">a web developer based in Milwaukee, WI</span> <a href="http://heropress.com/essays/beyond-imagination/">shared his HeroPress story</a> on how he got involved with WordPress. When Filippini was fired after two years of working in a retail management position, he dedicated all of his resources to learning web design and development in the late 90s and early 2000s.</p>\n<p>While the firing was a blow to his self-esteem, it provided him with the motivation to follow his passion. Filippini turned a bad situation into one of the best things that&#8217;s ever happened to him. Filippini&#8217;s story is another example that shows why local WordPress meetups are the cornerstone of the community.</p>\n<h2>A/B Testing With WordPress</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s a <a href="https://wpchat.com/t/ab-testing-plugin-or-service-what-do-you-use/1259">great discussion on WPChat.com</a> where folks are sharing information on the services and plugins they use to A/B test sites. The thread includes input from Josh Pollock, who develops <a href="http://ingothq.com/">Ingot</a>, an A/B testing plugin for WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Freedom, Speech, and Codes of Conduct</h2>\n<p>Morten Rand-Hendriksen <a href="http://mor10.com/on-freedom-and-speech/">published a great article</a> that dives into the freedom of speech, hate speech, codes of conduct, and the idea of speech as an act. I don&#8217;t understand what so many people have against codes of conduct but I agree with Hendriksen when he says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Codes of Conduct are in place to protect everyone’s rights: They ensure a space in which a civil discourse can take place without anyone resorting to personal attacks and creating an environment that becomes inaccessible or actively hostile to participants or groups. Codes of Conduct ensure open spaces for freedom of expression.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The Story Behind the Wapuu Coins at WordCamp US 2015</h2>\n<p>For many attendees at WordCamp US, the metal challenge coins distributed by GoDaddy <a href="https://twitter.com/benjaminefox/status/676987883954245633">were a hit</a>.

In general, plugins are limited to 12 or less and tags should relate to the plugin&#8217;s features.</p>\n<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content"><p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2016/01/20/reminder-policy-about-tags-in-plugin-readmes/">Reminder: Policy About Tags In Plugin Readmes</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Endless Stream of WordPress Positivity</h2>\n<p>The WordPress project <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-is-revamping-its-testimonials-page-with-ilovewp-social-media-campaign">recently revamped</a> its <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/testimonials/">testimonials page</a> that features testimonials from people sharing their love of WordPress on social media.

It&#8217;s difficult to install older versions of WordPress to obtain screenshots which is why the post is a treasure trove of information. The user interface has come a long way since its creation in 2003.</p>\n<h2>Hot Cocoa/Coffee Wapuu!</h2>\n<p>In what will be a traditional part of this series, I&#8217;m going to end each issue by featuring a Wapuu design. For those who don&#8217;t know, Wapuu is the <a href="http://wapuu.jp/2015/12/12/wapuu-origins/">unofficial mascot</a> of the WordPress project. As it&#8217;s Winter here in the US, Hot Cocoa/Coffee Wapuu, designed by Michelle Schulp, is one most of us can relate too.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Special <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wapuu?src=hash">#wapuu</a> for the season: Hot Cocoa/Coffee Wapuu!

Hosting and developing open source projects on GitHub is much easier than trying to get any participation from the community via a plugin&#8217;s Subversion repo on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>For these reasons Liuiza decided to create <a href="http://deployer.edwinapp.com/" target="_blank">Deployer</a>, a service that allows plugin developers to publish plugins to the WordPress.org Plugin Directory directly from GitHub, without using Subversion at all. He first presented the app at <a href="http://lithuania.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Lithuania</a> in September 2015, but hasn&#8217;t yet given it much promotion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wanted to streamline the process of publishing plugins from GitHub to WordPress.org,&#8221; Liuiza said. &#8220;I have more than 10 plugins in the repository, so I want to do things fast and easily.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last July we covered a similar service called <a href="http://wptavern.com/ship-a-new-app-for-shipping-plugins-from-github-to-wordpress-org" target="_blank">Ship</a>, which offered a hassle free approach to shipping plugins directly from GitHub to WordPress.org. Liuiza, with 10 plugins to maintain, was initially excited about Ship but found there were several drawbacks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;First, Ship required pretty wide access to my GitHub account,&#8221; he said. &#8220;GitHub does not provide granular API access, so I’d have to grant Ship access to all my GitHub repos, not only the one I wanted to publish from. That includes my private repos.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Second, Ship needed my WordPress.org credentials. And because it will need to use them regularly, they could not really hash them and had to store them in plaintext. Again, that would give Ship access to everything in my WordPress.org account. All plugins, all themes, all comments, all translations, etc. Everything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This inspired Liuiza to create Deployer with a new approach that doesn&#8217;t require giving away access and credentials.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In comparison to Ship, Deployer takes a quite opposite stance when it comes to requiring access,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Where Ship requests a lot of privileges, Deployer asks for almost none.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Deployer asks no privileges on GitHub. Public GitHub repositories can be cloned without any limitations by anyone, so Deployer does that. Deployer would need access to set up a WebHook for itself, but instead of requesting access Deployer provides step by step instructions for user how to set up the Webhook manually,&#8221; Liuiza said.</p>\n<p>The Deployer service doesn&#8217;t handle any sensitive authentication data for GitHub or WordPress.org. Instead, it requires a more manual setup.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Instead of requiring user’s WordPress.org credentials, Deployer has a dedicated WordPress.org user, deployer,&#8221; Liuiza said. &#8220;The plugin author has to manually add the deployer user to his plugin’s committer list, thus allowing that user to commit code to plugin’s SVN repository. This also enhances security, because WordPress.org can identify all the commits, made by the deployer user and roll them back in case there is a breach from Deployer’s side.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pushing a new version of a plugin from GitHub to WordPress.org is as easy as tagging the new version on GitHub. Deployer even handles updates to the readme.txt file and the assets directory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In terms of technology, Deployer is basically a single PHP file, that parses calls from GitHub Webhooks and then executes a bunch of shell commands (mostly git and svn) on a small Linux VPS box,&#8221; Liuiza said.</p>\n<p>Since launching last year, 34 plugins have been registered with Deployer, although Liuiza said he doesn&#8217;t keep logs on how many developers are using it regularly. He doesn&#8217;t currently have plans to monetize it but is happy to <a href="http://arunas.co/#coffee" target="_blank">accept donations</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Unless it becomes a drain on my resources (and it does not seem likely at this point) it will always be a free tool,&#8221; Liuiza said.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 20:59:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"WPTavern: WordPress is Revamping Its Testimonials Page with #ilovewp Social Media Campaign";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50890";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-is-revamping-its-testimonials-page-with-ilovewp-social-media-campaign";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6783:"<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/heart.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-50928"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/heart.jpg?resize=800%2C378" alt="photo credit: Wear your heart on a string - (license)" class="size-full wp-image-50928" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/34039290@N06/4683226311">Wear your heart on a string</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>WordPress.org is getting some love in 2016.

I also appreciate that the people behind WordPress, all the way up to the very top, are defenders of free speech and <a href="http://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">advocates of the open web</a>. Even if the technology behind the software makes radical shifts, WordPress&#8217; guiding principles are what make it a publishing platform that will stand the test of time.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 18:07:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"Matt: Testimonials for WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=45800";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"https://ma.tt/2016/01/testimonials-for-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:829:"<p>One area that&#8217;s been unloved for a bit on WordPress.org is the testimonials page, it was almost funny because they were so old they talked about things people don&#8217;t even know what they are any more.

Her proposal and associated mockups like the one below, generated a lot of discussion.

The project is composed of several smaller projects such as, the publishing user experience, automatic saving, the toolbar, metaboxes, and more.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A few of us have been talking about getting these projects going for a while so I wanted to see how much interest there is and how many contributors we have to work with. I am by no means leading this as much as doing what I can to get the people interested in some of these projects going on them. I’ll personally be working on some of the longer projects,&#8221; Arestad told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>A few people have already committed to parts of the project. <a class="mention" href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/karmatosed">Tammie Lister</a> is leading a team focused on improving the Revisions UI while Hugo Baeta is leading the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27159">Toolbar Remix</a> team.</p>\n<p>The Revisions UI project is focused on experimenting with alternative interfaces to improve user friendliness with a secondary goal of providing a way for users to quickly switch between revisions. The Toolbar Remix team will audit the toolbar in the editor and determine whether buttons should be rearranged, added, or removed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of these projects will span multiple releases depending on the complexity of implementations and the number of usability tests required. There might be a few small ones that make 4.5,&#8221; Arestad said.</p>\n<p>A majority of the projects are in the beginning stages. If you&#8217;re interested in contributing to an initiative, contact Arestad on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">SlackHQ</a> or the person leading the project that interests you. You can also <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2016/01/11/improving-post-new/">leave feedback</a> by commenting on the proposal.</p>\n<h2>Looking Forward to Change</h2>\n<p>I work in the post editor everyday and while it&#8217;s a good experience, I want to experiment with alternative interfaces like the conceptual editor in the screenshot above. Consolidating metaboxes into the visual editor is a refreshing idea that I want to use in the real world to see if it speeds up my workflow.</p>\n<p>If I were a betting man, I&#8217;d say the Add New Post screen is the most viewed and used part of the WordPress backend. Any changes to the editor and experience will affect a large number of users as evidenced by <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-4-removes-the-view-post-and-get-shortlink-buttons-from-the-post-editor">the removal</a> of the View Post and Get Shortlink buttons in WordPress 4.4. However, any change that is implemented will likely be meticulously calculated by the core team.</p>\n<p>What changes to the Add New Post screen do you want to see that would improve the way you create content in WordPress?</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 19:07:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:52:"WPTavern: Jetpack 3.9 Introduces New Sitemaps Module";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50845";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://wptavern.com/jetpack-3-9-introduces-new-sitemaps-module";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3218:"<p><a href="http://jetpack.me/2016/01/20/39-sitemaps-skype-sharing/" target="_blank">Jetpack 3.9</a> has just been released with a new module that makes it easy for users to add <a href="https://jetpack.me/support/sitemaps/" target="_blank">sitemaps</a> to their websites. Since <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/" target="_blank">sitemaps</a> are important for SEO, many WordPress sites already have a plugin installed to create them. The new module in Jetpack will detect if you&#8217;re already using one of the popular sitemap plugins before activating.</p>\n<p>Users who prefer their current sitemaps plugin can leave the Jetpack module deactivated. As an alternative, you can remove the extra plugin and simply opt for using the one in Jetpack.</p>\n<p>The new Sitemaps module has nothing to configure. It will automatically create the following two sitemaps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A generic sitemap: yoursitename.com/sitemap.xml\n<li>A news sitemap: yoursitename.com/news-sitemap.xml\n</ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jetpack-sitemaps.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50860"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jetpack-sitemaps.png?resize=1025%2C744" alt="jetpack-sitemaps" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50860" /></a></p>\n<p>The news sitemap is written specifically for publishers who want to show up in Google News. If you meet Google&#8217;s quality and technical guidelines for news sites, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/news/publisher/answer/40787?hl=en" target="_blank">apply to be included</a>. Upon approval, the search engine will index your site using this sitemap. It displays only posts published in the last 48 hours.</p>\n<p>Jetpack also includes two filters that allow you to add more post types to the sitemaps, since they are limited in what they display. The generic sitemap includes posts, pages, and the custom post types included in Jetpack. The news sitemap only includes posts.

Up until now, all of the club&#8217;s themes and plugins have been free, but Justin Tadlock decided to try something new with the release of <a href="http://themehybrid.com/plugins/theme-designer" target="_blank">Theme Designer</a>, priced at $125 (with support).</p>\n<p>The price tag reflects the fact that Theme Designer targets independent theme authors, a very small niche demographic. The plugin is a theme portfolio manager with meta fields that cater to displaying theme data. It is the first of its kind and goes far beyond a traditional portfolio plugin to pull in data from WordPress.org, such as ratings, active installs, and downloads.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/theme-designer.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50840"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/theme-designer.png?resize=1025%2C684" alt="theme-designer" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50840" /></a></p>\n<p>I spoke with Tadlock to find out why he decided to make the plunge into commercial plugin development after nearly a decade of creating free products and charging for support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From my observations, the larger WP ecosystem has changed over the years,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;When I first began Theme Hybrid, people were more willing to pay for support and less willing to pay for an entire theme/plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Commercial plugins were pretty much nonexistent at the time. Today, it&#8217;s a much different picture. Essentially, it&#8217;s a move that I think makes sense for my site as a business.</p>\n<p>He also said that, given the plugin&#8217;s limited audience, &#8220;There&#8217;s a finite number of people who would ever buy it. I couldn&#8217;t justify spending the development time on this as a free plugin.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>&#8220;Plugin development is where the commercial space is moving.&#8221;</h3>\n<p>Tadlock, a co-author on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-WordPress-Plugin-Development-Williams/dp/0470916222/" target="_blank">Professional WordPress Plugin Development</a>, is no stranger to the plugin space, but has always pursued other avenues of monetization (i.e. support and theme reviews.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Plugin development is where the commercial space is moving,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The theme market is saturated, and there&#8217;s only so much you can do with a theme. There&#8217;s still room to innovate with themes beyond the &#8216;slider + 3 boxes + 3 boxes&#8217; design, but that&#8217;s not my primary focus right now. Plugins allow me to explore ideas that I&#8217;d never be able to explore with themes,&#8221; Tadlock said.</p>\n<p>His next product will be aimed directly at plugin developers with a good deal of crossover on features from Theme Designer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll share much of the same UI,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;The WordPress.org Plugins API integration should be a little deeper. Plugin devs have extra info they can add with their <code>readme.txt</code> file.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve still got a bunch of research left though. With Theme Designer, I looked at all the major theme businesses like StudioPress, WooThemes, ThemeForest, and many more. So, I&#8217;ll need to do the same for plugins,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>With hundreds, or perhaps thousands of theme sellers out there, it&#8217;s surprising that the WordPress product space doesn&#8217;t already have more tools for showcasing their work. The theme market has long since matured to the point of sellers needing their own specialized tools. Every shop seems to end up building or adapting its own solution in-house. Tadlock is hoping that introducing commercial plugins like Theme Designer will expand Theme Hybrid&#8217;s user base.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the long run, it should bring in a wider audience of users,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One thing I&#8217;ve noticed over the past couple of years is that more people have already been signing up for plugin support, so the site&#8217;s audience is already in a transitioning phase.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tadlock still plans to build free plugins and themes in addition to the new commercial offerings. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see that changing any time soon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll still build free plugins and themes, so that&#8217;s not changing.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 23:41:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"WPTavern: WP Valet Rebrands Multimillion Dollar WordPress Support Business";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50814";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"http://wptavern.com/wp-valet-rebrands-multimillion-dollar-wordpress-support-business";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6325:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/valet-logo.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50824"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/valet-logo.png?resize=1025%2C385" alt="valet-logo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50824" /></a></p>\n<p>When Mason James hired his first contractor and launched <a href="http://www.valet.io/" target="_blank">WP Valet</a> in 2012, scaling up wasn&#8217;t part of his master plan. He knew he couldn&#8217;t do it alone but couldn&#8217;t imagine having more than a small team. His first contractor, Kim Lipari, became a partner and helped to bring in more customer requests than they knew how to handle. Four years later, the team is now 10 employees and 6 full-time contractors, and the company is hiring aggressively to fill more positions.</p>\n<p>Today WP Valet is dropping the &#8220;WP&#8221; from its name and <a href="http://www.valet.io/we-are-valet/" target="_blank">rebranding as Valet</a>. The company started out providing monthly professional services and support for WordPress website owners, but expanded to take on more client work after acquiring a local design agency.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In 2014, EasilyAmused merged with us and we acqui-hired their team,&#8221; James said. &#8220;James Tryon came on board as our Creative Director to continue leading this team. This made a huge difference as it doubled our team size and allowed us to provide a much higher level of design and development.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The rebranding announced today is a reflection of Valet&#8217;s expanded services. &#8220;We&#8217;re still 100% built on and using WordPress and think it&#8217;ll be an integral part of websites for a long, long time to come,&#8221; James said. &#8220;But we want to expand our customer reach as well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our services are centered around best practices that are applicable to all websites &#8211; regardless of their platform. And finally, our customer needs include branding, design, strategy, and a ton of other things that don&#8217;t specifically require WordPress. The new Valet brand provides us room to have these discussions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Growing the team to take on more custom development, in addition to monthly website support services, has paid off for Valet, which is now a multimillion dollar company.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen steady growth since we started in 2012,&#8221; James said. &#8220;We&#8217;re proud to be a grassroots startup with no funding or investors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our revenue is split pretty evenly between monthly support and individual custom development/design projects. Part of our rebranding goals was to line up our presentation with what we really do today.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While migrations made up a third of our revenue in the first year, it now accounts for less than an eighth! Overall our revenue is in the millions, though closer to 10M than to 100M. Year-over-year revenue growth increased about 45% in 2015.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Raising the Bar on Support</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wp-valet-team.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-50825"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wp-valet-team.jpg?resize=920%2C421" alt="wp-valet-team" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50825" /></a></p>\n<p>As Valet continues to scale its support services team, James is on a mission to change the WordPress support niche. When the company was first starting out, they became well known for handling migrations and maintenance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We reached out to a couple of companies and asked if we could do some migrations for them,&#8221; James said. &#8220;We wanted to better understand their setup and expectations. This resonated well with a few of those companies and we ended up doing thousands of migrations, growing the team to four people who exclusively handled migrations on a day-to-day basis.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, James never aimed for WP Valet to be a migrations and maintenance company and is determined to reshape customer thinking about monthly support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The truth is, WP Valet was founded on the idea of ongoing professional services,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was never meant to be specific to migrations or maintenance. The real passion was to make sure website owners had all the strategy, insights, and support they needed to operate in the month-to-month requirements of running a business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>James is hoping to change the support niche so as not to perpetuate the idea of &#8220;maintenance&#8221; to customers. He said that he doesn&#8217;t like the word and avoids it on purpose.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of our customers are not &#8216;brochure sites&#8217; with WordPress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re businesses. They rely on their sites to help create revenue.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I frequently tell our potential clients, <em>&#8216;Maintenance is fine for your dishwasher, but your business should always be pursuing growth!&#8217;</em> We do this by creating real, targeted metrics for our clients across several key areas of site performance and provide them with the ability to see these stats at any time. More than that, we work pro-actively to make sure key areas like site speed and traffic are improving without the client needing to open a specific request.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Valet team plans to focus on performance benchmarking this year while continuing to support the monthly needs of their customers. According to James, 50% of their revenue still comes from the regular monthly support plans. Balancing the rapid growth of the support team while managing projects as a full service agency is a delicate balancing act.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Growth and scaling are absolutely terrifying,&#8221; James said. &#8220;When people ask me about how fast we scale, I respond with something along the lines of &#8216;as much as we can without me lying in the fetal position under the piano in the den.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s more natural for me to identify and take action on failure then it is to measure success,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Finding success can leave me with a &#8216;now what?&#8217; feeling so I&#8217;m learning to enjoy the moments and victories on the ride.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 17:48:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"WPTavern: iThemes Announces Real-time Backup Service Stash Live";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50805";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://wptavern.com/ithemes-announces-real-time-backup-service-stash-live";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1582:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/StashLiveLogo.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50808"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50808" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/StashLiveLogo.png?resize=725%2C325" alt="Stash Live Banner" /></a><a href="https://ithemes.com/">iThemes</a>, a WordPress company that&#8217;s celebrating eight years in business this month, is announcing a new add-on called <a href="https://ithemes.com/2016/01/19/our-next-wordpress-game-changer-is-coming/">Stash Live</a> which will be part of BackupBuddy 7.0.

While this is great for users, some companies, plugin, and theme developers are struggling to keep up.</p>\n<p>We recently received the following email from a reader concerned with WordPress&#8217; release strategy:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As the pace of WordPress releases grows, plugin and theme developers have to constantly update their products. This is leading to a real and growing problem among WordPress site owners and companies like mine that handle website maintenance and updating.</p>\n<p>This pace is leading to an almost daily need to fix problems, caused by these updates. Plugin updates tend to break things, even though we primarily use professional, paid plugins for the idea of support and generally better quality products.</p>\n<p>I get that it&#8217;s important to patch security issues, but we&#8217;re also seeing a lot of new functionality, moving plugins into core, and other changes. These cause theme developers to push out updates with great frequency and they make mistakes.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m worried that the pace of core updates is driving the larger ecosystem toward failure. Everyone is scrambling to keep things patched, then new conflicts arise and things break down. The person on the end &#8216;companies maintaining their sites, responsibly, or services like mine&#8217; face a constant flow of updates, then testing, then trying to fix things that have broken.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg, Co-founder of the WordPress open source software project, specifically addressed this issue during the Q&amp;A session of the 2015 State of the Word at WordCamp US. Mika Epstein, who voluntarily reviews and approves plugins for the WordPress plugin directory, voiced the concerns shared by developers who are struggling to keep up.</p>\n<p>With the myriad of technologies developers have to learn, including the REST API and JavaScript, Epstein asked Mullenweg if WordPress is moving too fast and if the number of releases per year should decrease by one.</p>\n<div class="embed-wrap"></div>\n<p>Mullenweg answered the question by saying improvements can be made to the plugin directory so that users can share the burden in the testing process. He also said that the speed of WordPress development will increase instead of decrease. Meanwhile, the development team will continue to release three major versions per year.</p>\n<p>He then describes a future where developers may be able to lessen their support burden by using the REST API that&#8217;s slated for WordPress 4.5.

In June 2015, Andrew Nacin began the work of transforming GlotPress into a plugin with a <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/commit/d9d47271c6ce0c8e3d927088853ac47c1d100561" target="_blank">first pass</a> that switched it from using the BackPress external to a WordPress install. Dominik Schilling led the development on GitHub, which included <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/compare/d9d47271...d0a12dc035" target="_blank">352 commits</a> and fixes for <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A1.0+is%3Aissue" target="_blank">70 issues</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the first version the goal was to change as little as possible to get it working well,&#8221; Schilling said in the release announcement. &#8220;But still we had to remove some things in favor of WordPress&#8217; API system.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Version 1.0 includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s a plugin!</li>\n<li>WP-CLI support</li>\n<li>Integrated with WordPress’ user system</li>\n<li>Easy installation through the WordPress.org plugin directory</li>\n<li>Multisite support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a customized GlotPress install and you want to switch to the new WordPress plugin, you will want to review the plugin&#8217;s wiki to take stock of the <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/wiki/1.1-Breaking-Changes" target="_blank">breaking changes</a>. Contributors have also written a guide to <a href="https://github.com/deliciousbrains/GlotPress/wiki/1.2-Converting-Plugins" target="_blank">converting plugins</a> for the standalone version to use the WordPress plugin infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Having GlotPress available as a plugin makes it much easier to use and update. The standalone version had a more complicated installation and configuration process, but it was worth it for the collaboration capabilities that it offered. All this can now be added to any WordPress site with the click of a button.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/glotpress/" target="_blank">GlotPress plugin</a> is now available for download on WordPress.org and includes a beautiful newly designed plugin icon and banner. An <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/wiki/2.-Branding-and-Logos" target="_blank">official branding guide</a> is also available thanks to Hugo Baeta and other contributors.

Last week, project maintainers <a href="http://wptavern.com/open-source-project-maintainers-confront-github-with-open-letter-on-issue-management" target="_blank">published a letter called &#8220;Dear GitHub&#8221;</a> that outlines their concerns and the solutions they hope to see implemented.</p>\n<p>GitHub has not officially responded to these concerns, apart from a new Director of Community dropping <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10905338" target="_blank">a note on Hacker News</a> to recognize the feedback with a disclaimer that he is &#8220;still figuring out how GitHub fits together as an organization but&#8230; happy to take a look into these issues and ensure they are considered in how future work is planned.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GitLab, on the other hand, wasted no time in addressing the group&#8217;s concerns in a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2016/01/15/making-gitlab-better-for-large-open-source-projects/" target="_blank">post</a> that begins, &#8220;Dear open source maintainers:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>We want GitLab to be the best place for any software project, whether open source or not, whether big or small.</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github" target="_blank">The letter of GitHub’s open source community</a> is clearly not addressed to us, but we’re thinking a lot about the issues that were mentioned in it. We see many of these things happening and have been working on them for a long time, not in the least because we develop on <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues" target="_blank">a busy public issue tracker</a> ourselves.</p></blockquote>\n<p>GitLab, which already allows project maintainers to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/doc/customization/issue_and_merge_request_template.md" target="_blank">set a template for an issue and for merge requests</a>, is planning on adding <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/101" target="_blank">multiple templates</a>, and is strongly considering the suggestion of <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/8988" target="_blank">custom fields</a>. A new <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/9088" target="_blank">issue</a> has been created to track discussion and progress on the possibility of using a new_issue.md file for templates.</p>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Jobvo" target="_blank">Job van der Voort</a>, VP of Product at GitLab, addressed every concern mentioned in the open letter to GitHub. He highlighted the fact that<br />\nGitLab already has a voting system that transforms +1s into votes and noted plans for improving the placement of CONTRIBUTING.md at the top of issues screens.</p>\n<p>Van der Voort also created a new issue for the GitLab Community Edition called &#8220;<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/8938" target="_blank">Making GitLab the best place for big open source projects</a>.&#8221; This issue is now home to a long list of of frustrations and suggestions that were included in the original letter to GitHub. Van der Voort and contributors have responded to every single point and have created new issues for improving GitLab where necessary.</p>\n<p>After just four days, the <a href="https://github.com/dear-github/" target="_blank">Dear GitHub</a> letter has received more than 1,100 signatures from open source project maintainers. Although the authors have received no official response from GitHub, the letter has sparked some healthy discussions around the web about how code hosting services can better serve their open source communities.</p>\n<p>Both GitHub and GitLab have built their reputations and business on supporting open source software, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/08/github-data-shows-changing-software-landscape/" target="_blank">which has now become mainstream</a> and more easily adopted by enterprises. Open source software runs the world. No code hosting site that aims to be the leader can afford to ignore the requests of open source project maintainers for long.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 05:34:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"WPTavern: Atom Editor Package Adds Autocomplete for WordPress Actions and Filters";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50670";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"http://wptavern.com/atom-editor-package-adds-autocomplete-for-wordpress-actions-and-filters";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2759:"<p>Nearly two years ago, <a href="https://github.com/blog/1831-atom-free-and-open-source-for-everyone" target="_blank">GitHub open sourced Atom</a>, its new JavaScript-powered text editor.

All of our WordPress content is on a separate database server, so the main content is still intact. I&#8217;ve also been able to extract a <em>few</em> things from a raw image of the damaged drive.  But there were some things (site-specific plugins, child-themes, media content, utility scripts, my email archives) which are likely gone for good, or that will at least be painful to put back into place (uploaded images, etc.).</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s not much use crying over spilt milk, though, so I at least saw this as an opportunity to freshen up and improve upon my previous server configuration. In its previous incarnation, I had been running Apache workers, and PHP-FPM (PHP 5.6.x). But I also had some web experiments in Nodejs, which I had to run on a non-standard port, so as to not conflict with Apache. Since I was starting from scratch anyways, I&#8217;ve decided to put HAProxy in front of everything, so that I can internally run multiple web servers, and just proxy to them transparently. And while I was at it, I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot of good things about the speed improvements in PHP 7, so I figured I&#8217;d upgrade that, as well.</p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t go into the nitty-gritty details of my install (especially since I&#8217;m not finished yet), but I did want to let others know about a problem I&#8217;ve run into: There is a new development build of the php-ssh2 extension for PHP 7, but it is not quite complete yet. Many things do work, but unfortunately, all of the functions which rely on the ability to use the <code>stat()</code> call are broken at this time. This includes other file-checking functions such as <code>is_dir()</code>, and <code>is_file()</code>, <code>file_exists()</code>. In WordPress, if you are using the SSH2 filesystem class (rather than FTP or FTPS), this will prevent you from using the built-in plugin and theme installers, or any of the automatic upgrade functionality.</p>\n<p>After digging around in the php-ssh2 extension source code for a while and comparing to a previous version, I was unable to find the problem myself. My C programming is too rusty, and I just don&#8217;t have the time to start learning PHP and libssh2 internals from scratch. But, I did <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71376">file a bug on the PHP Bugtracker</a>, and the author of the PHP 7 port of the php-ssh2 extension has said that he is working on a fix. So keep an out out for an update on that.</p>\n<p>Just as a side-note, using fstat() on a filehandle opened on an ssh2.sftp file resource, or using the ssh2_sftp_stat() call do work. But that doesn&#8217;t help with the is_dir() and is_file() calls which are failing in the class-wp-filesystem-ssh2.php code. Those functions rely on the PHP internal ssh2.sftp stream wrappers.</p>\n<p>Postscript: I know plenty of people will say, &#8220;You should have had backups!&#8221; or even, &#8220;Your VPS host must suck for not having backups!&#8221;. The former is absolutely true &#8212; I should have done better at backing up some of the things that I did not have backups for. The VPS host is not really to blame. I had gotten a disk size upgrade, and I actually had an opportunity to request a snapshot of my system before I ran the upgrade process to extend my disk. But because I had run it successfully on another server without incident, I got careless. And after the upgrade, the system seemed to run fine for about three weeks before any problems surfaced.</p>\n<p>Original Article: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2016/01/18/wordpress-php7-and-updates-via-php-ssh2/">WordPress, PHP7, and Updates via php-ssh2</a><br />\n<a rel="nofollow" href="http://dougal.gunters.org">Dougal Campbell&#039;s geek ramblings - WordPress, web development, and world domination.</a></p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss yarpp-related-none">\n<img src="http://yarpp.org/pixels/5db43ee24c4f1e1d0e45d08cc91b0130" alt="YARPP" />\n</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 18:14:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Dougal Campbell";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"WPTavern: WPShout’s 2016 Webhosting Survey Results Show Specialized Hosts Are Doing Well";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50665";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"http://wptavern.com/wpshouts-2016-webhosting-survey-results-show-specialized-hosts-are-doing-well";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2889:"<p>WPShout has <a href="http://wpshout.com/wordpress-hosting-review-2016-results/">published the results</a> of its 2016 <a href="http://wptavern.com/wpshout-is-accepting-submissions-for-its-2016-webhosting-survey">webhosting survey</a> taken by 135 respondents.

After pursuing official channels without receiving a response, the group&#8217;s members say that they are frustrated by a lack of communication:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Those of us who run some of the most popular projects on GitHub feel completely ignored by you. We’ve gone through the only support channel that you have given us either to receive an empty response or even no response at all. We have no visibility into what has happened with our requests, or whether GitHub is working on them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Authors of the &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/dear-github/" target="_blank">Dear GitHub</a>&#8221; repository, which has no public members, collectively penned <a href="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github" target="_blank">an earnest letter</a> that outlines three critical problems they perceive with the way issues currently work.</p>\n<p>The first problem the group states is a lack of features for GitHub issues, and they propose a simple solution:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Issues are often filed missing crucial information like reproduction steps or version tested. We’d like issues to gain custom fields, along with a mechanism (such as a mandatory issue template, perhaps powered by a newissue.md in root as a likely-simple solution) for ensuring they are filled out in every issue.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The group is also calling for GitHub to create a &#8220;first-class voting system&#8221; that would declutter the ubiquitous &#8220;+1&#8243;&#8216;s that litter nearly every popular project&#8217;s issues queue. They recognize the +1s as important feedback but demand a better UI to organize this information:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Issues often accumulate content-less “+1” comments which serve only to spam the maintainers and any others subscribed to the issue. These +1s serve a valuable function in letting maintainers know how widespread an issue is, but their drawbacks are too great. We’d like issues to gain a first-class voting system, and for content-less comments like “+1” or “:+1:” or “me too” to trigger a warning and instructions on how to use the voting mechanism.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The third issue directly impacts the open source workflow, which becomes inefficient when issues and requests are improperly submitted. The proposed solution streamlines important information that guides users toward submitting meaningful contributions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Issues and pull requests are often created without any adherence to the CONTRIBUTING.md contribution guidelines, due to the inconspicuous nature of the “guidelines for contributing” link when creating an issue and the fact that it often contains a lot of information that isn’t relevant to opening issues (such as information about hacking on the project). Maintainers should be able to configure a file in the repo (interpreted as GFM) to be displayed at the top of the new issue / PR page instead of that link. Maintainers can choose to inline content there and / or link to other pages as appropriate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Authors of the letter have waited years for progress on these issues. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oGsg02jS-PnlIMJ3OlWIOEmhtG-udTwuDz_vsQPBHKs/htmlview?usp=sharing&sle=true" target="_blank">600+ project maintainers who have signed the document</a> are incapable of making these changes themselves, since GitHub&#8217;s infrastructure is not open source.</p>\n<h3>GitHub&#8217;s Paying Customers Don&#8217;t Share the Same Problems as Open Source Project Maintainers</h3>\n<p>With more than <a href="https://github.com/about/press" target="_blank">12 million people collaborating across 31 million repositories</a> as of January 2015, GitHub is home to the largest collection of code on the planet. Its emphasis on &#8220;social coding&#8221; and free hosting for public projects has made GitHub the defacto place to make code available for collaboration. As a result, many free users often forget that it&#8217;s the <a href="https://enterprise.github.com/home" target="_blank">GitHub Enterprise</a> customers who keep the lights on at the company.</p>\n<p>Julian Dunn, a product manager at <a href="http://www.chef.io/" target="_blank">Chef</a>, wrote <a href="http://www.juliandunn.net/2016/01/14/dear-dear-github-from-your-local-friendly-product-person/" target="_blank">a response to the &#8220;Dear GitHub&#8221; letter</a>. He contends that GitHub, unless forced by heated press coverage, isn&#8217;t likely to address these concerns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I were the product manager for GitHub, the answer to your requests would probably be &#8216;no,''&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;That’s not because I think your feature requests aren’t legitimate. It’s because they don’t impact paying customers very highly. And as a company whose developers have to eat, GitHub is probably going to prioritize those customers first.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His reasoning is that the issue management problems that plague open source communities don&#8217;t affect GitHub&#8217;s bread and butter to the same degree.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Paying customers use private repositories and/or GitHub Enterprise, and the wild[er]-west aspects of an open-source ecosystem simply don’t exist inside a company,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;You’re unlikely to see +1-DDoS-type behavior inside private repos, for example.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GitHub has yet to officially address the &#8220;Dear GitHub&#8221; letter. With a growing list of more than 600 maintainers of popular open source projects signing the document, it will soon be in the company&#8217;s best interest to communicate a response. Authors of the letter are hoping the company will choose to act in support of its open source community to solve the unique challenges that project maintainers contend with when hosting on GitHub.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re an open source project maintainer, is this a letter you would sign? Does the current way that GitHub issues are structured satisfy the needs of your project and its users? Would the proposed solutions make a difference for your project?</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Jan 2016 22:06:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:10:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 08:18:25 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"286695";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 08:15:13 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20160211062508";}', 'no');

Your use of this site is subject to both the Privacy Policy and these TOU.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">12. Limitation of Warranties</p>\r\n<p class="text">JKC PROVIDES THIS WEBSITE AND THE CONTENT, INFORMATION, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ON OR THROUGH IT “AS IS”, AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. JKC SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some states may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so check local laws.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">13. Limitation of Liability</p>\r\n<p class="text">JKC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT OR SERVICES AT THE SITE OR FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE MATERIALS AT THE SITE WILL BE AVAILABLE, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, THAT THIS SITE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, THAT ALL PRODUCTS LISTED, SOLD OR ADVERTISED ARE AVAILABLE, OR THAT ALL TRANSACTIONS WILL BE COMPLETED. NEITHER JKC NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, LICENSORS OR LICENSEES WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE CONTENT, MATERIALS OR INFORMATION CONTAINED AT THIS SITE ARE CORRECT, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, UP TO DATE, AND/OR RELIABLE.</p>\r\n<p class="text">IN NO EVENT SHALL JKC OR ANYONE WHO HELPED DEVELOP, CREATE, PRODUCE, DISPLAY, TRANSMIT OR DELIVER THE CONTENT, MATERIAL AND INFORMATION USED IN THIS SITE BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, TREBLE, ENHANCED, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, USE OF OUR SITE, LINKS TO OR FROM THIS SITE, INFORMATION POSTED ON OUR SITE, OUR SERVICES, ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES YOU PURCHASE, OR THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, FOR ACCESSING THIS SITE. NEITHER JKC NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, LICENSORS OR LICENSEES SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES YOU MIGHT SUSTAIN BY ENGAGING IN TRANSACTIONS WITH BUYERS OR SELLERS WHO YOU MEET AS A RESULT OF CLASSIFIED ADVERTISEMENTS POSTED ON ANY JKC WEBSITE. Some states do not allow the limitation of liability, so check local laws.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">14. Classified Advertisements</p>\r\n<p class="text">Some of our websites provide a forum (such as classified advertisements) in which sellers and buyers may be connected. By engaging in transactions with buyers or sellers that you meet via one of our websites, you proceed solely at your own risk and you agree that JKC is not responsible for any losses that you might sustain as a result of your transactions with such buyers and sellers. You should not engage in any transaction with a person with whom you are not comfortable or whom you suspect might be engaged in improper or questionable conduct. Please be aware that JKC, through certain of its websites, merely provides a forum in which buyers and sellers can connect. Neither JKC nor its websites posting classified advertisements facilitate any transaction, insure any transaction, or act as an intermediary, broker, or escrow agent in connection with such buyer-seller transactions.</p>\r\n<p class="text">You should be very careful before you send money to any seller posting an advertisement on one of our sites. In particular, we urge you to use reputable and well known money-transfer services and on-line merchant account services (such as PayPal) in engaging in transactions with sellers of goods advertised on one of our websites. We urge you to proceed with extreme caution in using such money transfer services, and under no circumstances should you deliver cash to a money transfer service with instructions to disburse the funds to an alleged agent of JKC or the website on which the classified advertisement was posted. Again, neither JKC nor its websites posting classified advertisements act as a transaction intermediary or escrow agent, and you should not do business with any seller who directs you to work with an employee or agent of JKC or the applicable website in completing the transaction.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">15. Indemnity and Hold Harmless</p>\r\n<p class="text">We are not responsible for the accuracy, quality, safety, legality, intellectual property compliance, privacy policy, or content of any information, product or service offered by users, vendors, advertisers, promotional or business partners or any third-party sites, and you irrevocably waive any claim against JKC and its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, licensors and licensees with respect to the same. JKC does not guarantee such accuracy, and makes no representations regarding the use or results of use of any Content on this site in terms of its accuracy, reliability or any other matter. You assume the risk of their use and the entire cost of all necessary loss, servicing, repair or correction as a result of their use.</p>\r\n<p class="text">You agree to hold JKC and its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, licensors and licensees harmless from any and all claims, demands, attorneys’ fees, damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known and unknown, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of, or any way connected with the use of any information at this site, any transaction occurring through this site, the safety or quality of any goods or services purchased or sold through this site, or the truth or accuracy of any claim made about such goods or services.</p>\r\n<p class="text">You also agree to indemnify, defend, and hold JKC and its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, licensors and licensees harmless from any loss, claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of this website, your breach of these Terms of Use or the documents that it incorporates by reference, or your violation of any law or the rights of any third party in connection with your use of this site.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">16.

Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party.

Changes to these TOU shall be effective upon posting. Continued use of the site following the effective date of any changes to these TOU constitutes your acceptance of those changes.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">20. General Provisions</p>\r\n<p class="text">(a) Severability. If any provision of these TOU is held to be invalid or unenforceable, it shall be stricken without affecting the validity of the remaining portions of these TOU. Headings are for convenience only, and are not intended in any way to confine, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.</p>\r\n<p class="text">(b) No Waiver. No waiver by JKC of any breach of these TOU by you shall constitute a waiver of this or any other provision of these TOU or alter or limit our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>\r\n<p class="text">(c) Entire Agreement. These Terms of Use and the materials incorporated by reference herein, including the JKC Privacy Policy, form the entire understanding and agreement between you and JKC with respect to your use of this site and the services offered hereunder, and may be modified only in accordance with the procedures specified herein.</p>\r\n<p class="text">(d) No Agency.

The terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy are hereby incorporated into these TOU, and these TOU are incorporated into our Privacy Policy. Your use of this site is subject to both the Privacy Policy and these TOU.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">12. Limitation of Warranties</p>\r\n<p class="text">JKC PROVIDES THIS WEBSITE AND THE CONTENT, INFORMATION, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ON OR THROUGH IT “AS IS”, AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. JKC SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some states may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so check local laws.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">13. Limitation of Liability</p>\r\n<p class="text">JKC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT OR SERVICES AT THE SITE OR FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE MATERIALS AT THE SITE WILL BE AVAILABLE, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, THAT THIS SITE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, THAT ALL PRODUCTS LISTED, SOLD OR ADVERTISED ARE AVAILABLE, OR THAT ALL TRANSACTIONS WILL BE COMPLETED. NEITHER JKC NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, LICENSORS OR LICENSEES WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE CONTENT, MATERIALS OR INFORMATION CONTAINED AT THIS SITE ARE CORRECT, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, UP TO DATE, AND/OR RELIABLE.</p>\r\n<p class="text">IN NO EVENT SHALL JKC OR ANYONE WHO HELPED DEVELOP, CREATE, PRODUCE, DISPLAY, TRANSMIT OR DELIVER THE CONTENT, MATERIAL AND INFORMATION USED IN THIS SITE BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, TREBLE, ENHANCED, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, USE OF OUR SITE, LINKS TO OR FROM THIS SITE, INFORMATION POSTED ON OUR SITE, OUR SERVICES, ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES YOU PURCHASE, OR THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, FOR ACCESSING THIS SITE. NEITHER JKC NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, LICENSORS OR LICENSEES SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES YOU MIGHT SUSTAIN BY ENGAGING IN TRANSACTIONS WITH BUYERS OR SELLERS WHO YOU MEET AS A RESULT OF CLASSIFIED ADVERTISEMENTS POSTED ON ANY JKC WEBSITE. Some states do not allow the limitation of liability, so check local laws.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">14. Classified Advertisements</p>\r\n<p class="text">Some of our websites provide a forum (such as classified advertisements) in which sellers and buyers may be connected. By engaging in transactions with buyers or sellers that you meet via one of our websites, you proceed solely at your own risk and you agree that JKC is not responsible for any losses that you might sustain as a result of your transactions with such buyers and sellers. You should not engage in any transaction with a person with whom you are not comfortable or whom you suspect might be engaged in improper or questionable conduct. Please be aware that JKC, through certain of its websites, merely provides a forum in which buyers and sellers can connect. Neither JKC nor its websites posting classified advertisements facilitate any transaction, insure any transaction, or act as an intermediary, broker, or escrow agent in connection with such buyer-seller transactions.</p>\r\n<p class="text">You should be very careful before you send money to any seller posting an advertisement on one of our sites. In particular, we urge you to use reputable and well known money-transfer services and on-line merchant account services (such as PayPal) in engaging in transactions with sellers of goods advertised on one of our websites. We urge you to proceed with extreme caution in using such money transfer services, and under no circumstances should you deliver cash to a money transfer service with instructions to disburse the funds to an alleged agent of JKC or the website on which the classified advertisement was posted. Again, neither JKC nor its websites posting classified advertisements act as a transaction intermediary or escrow agent, and you should not do business with any seller who directs you to work with an employee or agent of JKC or the applicable website in completing the transaction.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">15. Indemnity and Hold Harmless</p>\r\n<p class="text">We are not responsible for the accuracy, quality, safety, legality, intellectual property compliance, privacy policy, or content of any information, product or service offered by users, vendors, advertisers, promotional or business partners or any third-party sites, and you irrevocably waive any claim against JKC and its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, licensors and licensees with respect to the same.

Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party.

Changes to these TOU shall be effective upon posting. Continued use of the site following the effective date of any changes to these TOU constitutes your acceptance of those changes.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">20. General Provisions</p>\r\n<p class="text">(a) Severability. If any provision of these TOU is held to be invalid or unenforceable, it shall be stricken without affecting the validity of the remaining portions of these TOU. Headings are for convenience only, and are not intended in any way to confine, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.</p>\r\n<p class="text">(b) No Waiver. No waiver by JKC of any breach of these TOU by you shall constitute a waiver of this or any other provision of these TOU or alter or limit our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>\r\n<p class="text">(c) Entire Agreement. These Terms of Use and the materials incorporated by reference herein, including the JKC Privacy Policy, form the entire understanding and agreement between you and JKC with respect to your use of this site and the services offered hereunder, and may be modified only in accordance with the procedures specified herein.</p>\r\n<p class="text">(d) No Agency.

Limitation of Warranties</p>\r\n<p class="text">JKC PROVIDES THIS WEBSITE AND THE CONTENT, INFORMATION, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ON OR THROUGH IT “AS IS”, AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. JKC SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some states may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so check local laws.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">13. Limitation of Liability</p>\r\n<p class="text">JKC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT OR SERVICES AT THE SITE OR FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE MATERIALS AT THE SITE WILL BE AVAILABLE, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, THAT THIS SITE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, THAT ALL PRODUCTS LISTED, SOLD OR ADVERTISED ARE AVAILABLE, OR THAT ALL TRANSACTIONS WILL BE COMPLETED. NEITHER JKC NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, LICENSORS OR LICENSEES WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE CONTENT, MATERIALS OR INFORMATION CONTAINED AT THIS SITE ARE CORRECT, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, UP TO DATE, AND/OR RELIABLE.</p>\r\n<p class="text">IN NO EVENT SHALL JKC OR ANYONE WHO HELPED DEVELOP, CREATE, PRODUCE, DISPLAY, TRANSMIT OR DELIVER THE CONTENT, MATERIAL AND INFORMATION USED IN THIS SITE BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, TREBLE, ENHANCED, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, USE OF OUR SITE, LINKS TO OR FROM THIS SITE, INFORMATION POSTED ON OUR SITE, OUR SERVICES, ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES YOU PURCHASE, OR THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, FOR ACCESSING THIS SITE. NEITHER JKC NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, LICENSORS OR LICENSEES SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES YOU MIGHT SUSTAIN BY ENGAGING IN TRANSACTIONS WITH BUYERS OR SELLERS WHO YOU MEET AS A RESULT OF CLASSIFIED ADVERTISEMENTS POSTED ON ANY JKC WEBSITE. Some states do not allow the limitation of liability, so check local laws.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">14. Classified Advertisements</p>\r\n<p class="text">Some of our websites provide a forum (such as classified advertisements) in which sellers and buyers may be connected. By engaging in transactions with buyers or sellers that you meet via one of our websites, you proceed solely at your own risk and you agree that JKC is not responsible for any losses that you might sustain as a result of your transactions with such buyers and sellers. You should not engage in any transaction with a person with whom you are not comfortable or whom you suspect might be engaged in improper or questionable conduct. Please be aware that JKC, through certain of its websites, merely provides a forum in which buyers and sellers can connect. Neither JKC nor its websites posting classified advertisements facilitate any transaction, insure any transaction, or act as an intermediary, broker, or escrow agent in connection with such buyer-seller transactions.</p>\r\n<p class="text">You should be very careful before you send money to any seller posting an advertisement on one of our sites. In particular, we urge you to use reputable and well known money-transfer services and on-line merchant account services (such as PayPal) in engaging in transactions with sellers of goods advertised on one of our websites. We urge you to proceed with extreme caution in using such money transfer services, and under no circumstances should you deliver cash to a money transfer service with instructions to disburse the funds to an alleged agent of JKC or the website on which the classified advertisement was posted. Again, neither JKC nor its websites posting classified advertisements act as a transaction intermediary or escrow agent, and you should not do business with any seller who directs you to work with an employee or agent of JKC or the applicable website in completing the transaction.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">15. Indemnity and Hold Harmless</p>\r\n<p class="text">We are not responsible for the accuracy, quality, safety, legality, intellectual property compliance, privacy policy, or content of any information, product or service offered by users, vendors, advertisers, promotional or business partners or any third-party sites, and you irrevocably waive any claim against JKC and its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, licensors and licensees with respect to the same. JKC does not guarantee such accuracy, and makes no representations regarding the use or results of use of any Content on this site in terms of its accuracy, reliability or any other matter. You assume the risk of their use and the entire cost of all necessary loss, servicing, repair or correction as a result of their use.</p>\r\n<p class="text">You agree to hold JKC and its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, licensors and licensees harmless from any and all claims, demands, attorneys’ fees, damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known and unknown, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of, or any way connected with the use of any information at this site, any transaction occurring through this site, the safety or quality of any goods or services purchased or sold through this site, or the truth or accuracy of any claim made about such goods or services.</p>\r\n<p class="text">You also agree to indemnify, defend, and hold JKC and its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, licensors and licensees harmless from any loss, claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of this website, your breach of these Terms of Use or the documents that it incorporates by reference, or your violation of any law or the rights of any third party in connection with your use of this site.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">16. Termination of Services</p>\r\n<p class="text">We may eliminate or terminate any Content or service posted on or made available through any of our websites without notice to you at any time in our sole discretion.

Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this Section, JKC may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any federal or state court having jurisdiction in the event of your violation of these TOU and/or your infringement of JKC’s intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of any other person or party.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">19. Modifications to these Terms of Use</p>\r\n<p class="text">JKC reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these TOU at any time, so please check this site or any other JKC website you use periodically for changes. Changes to these TOU shall be effective upon posting. Continued use of the site following the effective date of any changes to these TOU constitutes your acceptance of those changes.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">20. General Provisions</p>\r\n<p class="text">(a) Severability. If any provision of these TOU is held to be invalid or unenforceable, it shall be stricken without affecting the validity of the remaining portions of these TOU. Headings are for convenience only, and are not intended in any way to confine, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.</p>\r\n<p class="text">(b) No Waiver. No waiver by JKC of any breach of these TOU by you shall constitute a waiver of this or any other provision of these TOU or alter or limit our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>\r\n<p class="text">(c) Entire Agreement. These Terms of Use and the materials incorporated by reference herein, including the JKC Privacy Policy, form the entire understanding and agreement between you and JKC with respect to your use of this site and the services offered hereunder, and may be modified only in accordance with the procedures specified herein.</p>\r\n<p class="text">(d) No Agency.

WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Personal Information.</span> We collect personally identifiable information, such as names, mailing addresses, email addresses, demographic information, and similar information in a variety of situations, including but not limited to the following: (i) when you register at our website in connection with the purchase of a product, publication, or service; (ii) when you enter personal information on our website as a condition of participating in contests, promotions, or sweepstakes offered via the website; or (iii) when you wish to have a product or service fulfilled by a fulfillment partner who can meet the continuing needs of our customers.\r\n        Our site may collect credit card and related financial information if you wish to purchase a product or subscribe to any publication or service offered via the site. If you wish to place an order for products or services online, you must generally establish a credit card account with us or our vendors. Some of our sites also may collect social security numbers from consumers if such consumers of our automotive-related website wish to receive a quote from an automotive lender that is part of the site’s automotive lender network. In such instances, we may collect social security numbers only to fulfill consumers’ requests to receive quotes or other financial offers from a lender in the site’s automotive lender network.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Information Collected Automatically.</span> Our website automatically collects certain information, such as your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times,  and referring website address. This helps facilitate your online experience at our website. See Sections IV and V of this Privacy Policy for more detail on cookies, web beacons, and other information collected automatically by our website.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">II. WHAT DO WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">We use the personal information you provide to allow you to make product purchases, to fulfill your requests, improve our publications, products and services, to send you promotional offers related to JKC or our business partners, and to operate our business. A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving promotional offers by mail or email. We also use collected information to evaluate and administer our products and services, respond to any problems that may arise, such as difficulties in navigating our site or accessing certain features, as well as to gauge user trends to determine what products and services are most popular with users, and to put you in touch with fulfillment partners who can provide services that we cannot. We allow users of our website to send articles or links by email to other parties who may be interested in them. We do not retain any email addresses of either the sender or recipient of such articles or links after they are sent, and do not share “send a friend” email addresses with third parties.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">III. HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        We share your personal information only as described below.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Sharing Within JKC.</span> We may share your personal information with any parent company, subsidiary, or affiliate of JKC. All entities within JKC’s corporate family may have access to your personal information as well as anonymous, aggregate demographic data.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">JKC’s Service Providers.</span> JKC may decide to share your personal information with companies that work on behalf of or with JKC. These companies may use your personal information to inform you about JKC’s products and services, to provide you with information about other exciting products and services, or otherwise to assist JKC in serving its customers, understanding its consumer market, or devising effective marketing strategies to reach more consumers.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Lead Purchasers.</span> JKC may decide to share your personal information with third parties who purchase leads from JKC, such as automotive dealers and banks. Some of our websites require users to disclose personal information as a condition of receiving quotes or offers from fulfillment partners (as described more fully below), such as automotive dealers or banks, who can provide services or products to users that JKC does not directly provide. In these instances, your personal information will be provided to third parties who compensate JKC for leads delivered to such third parties.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Participating Vendors.</span> Some of our sites offer opportunities to make purchases online from special participating vendors. On sites with online purchase opportunities for products and merchandise, we will also give participating vendors the order information and authorization for the merchant bank. Any time you order from a participating vendor, that vendor will automatically have all the information related to the order. Participating vendors may use that information to advise you directly of other products and offerings that they provide.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Credit Card Companies.</span> Third Party Payment Services; Third Party Promotional Sites. As in any transaction, your credit card company will have all relevant information about the name of the vendor, item(s) purchased, and date and total cost. JKC will not otherwise provide any personal data to your credit card company. In some cases, we use third party payment and transaction services to facilitate your transactions and process your orders. In such cases, we will share your personal information and credit card information with the third party payment services solely for the purpose of completing the transaction or processing your order. In some cases, we will share your personal information and credit card information with third parties who may offer you a gift or promotional offer as a result of your purchase or subscription to a JKC product or publication.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Fulfillment Partners.</span> Some of our websites are intended to facilitate transactions between you and a third party. To do so, we collect and share additional personal information, like credit information, so such third parties can provide the product or service you request. As our fulfillment partners may keep and use your information whether or not you purchase their products or use their services, your personal information will be subject to their privacy policies.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Other Third Parties.</span> We may share your personal information with third parties, such as advertisers, sponsors, and other promotional and business partners, only when you have not opted out of receiving communications from third parties. If you wish to opt-out of receiving third party communications, you may exercise this right by following the opt-out procedures contained in any email or written communication JKC sends to you or by following the procedures set forth in Section VII of this Privacy Policy.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Public Postings.</span> You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information, personal or otherwise, online in any community area (whether through JKC’s website or any other service available online), that information can be collected and used by others. Accordingly, you should use caution when sharing any personal information with others in any community area (whether through JKC’s website or any other service available online).\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Required Disclosures of Information.</span> We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request; to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect the integrity of our sites and our property and assure adherence to our terms of use; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation or process.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Changes in Corporate Structure.</span> In developing our business, we might sell certain assets, or the company, or parts of it, may be sold, merged or otherwise transferred. In such transactions, user information, whether personally identifiable or otherwise, may be one of the transferred assets.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">IV. HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        Your Web browser offers “cookies” which, if you allow their use, store small amounts of data on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information about you and therefore cannot be used to identify you personally. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best, and also enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your browser and our website is viewable even if you disable the cookie function on your browser. However, if you disable cookies, some advanced and customized features or offerings on our site will not be available to you. In addition to collecting cookies, JKC may distribute, sell, and/or transfer such cookies to third parties with whom JKC has a commercial relationship. If you do not wish your cookies to be used in this manner, you can modify your browser to disable the collection of cookies.\r\n        Additionally, we use third-party companies to collect non-personally identifiable information (e.g., the pages you visit, and which links you click, which ads you see and click on, and the categories of search terms you enter) when you visit one of our websites. Some of these third-party companies collect information when serving ads on our sites, while others collect information without showing ads on our sites. These companies may use the information outlined above (which does not include your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies often use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">V. HOW DO WE USE WEB BEACONS, WEB ANALYTICS, AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MARKETING TECHNOLOGIES?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        A number of technologies exist to assess consumer behavior both on-line and off-line. JKC employs a variety of these technologies, including web beacons (see below), web analytics techniques, and other behavior marketing technologies, to assess consumer behavior and to understand how we can better serve our customers. Many of these technologies are provided to JKC via third party providers specializing in behavioral marketing and consumer behavior. In the course of using these behavioral marketing technologies, we automatically collect non-personal information from you, including but not limited to the following types of information: Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login, email address; computer and connection information such as browser type and related browser data; content viewed; and purchase history, which may be aggregated with other information for analytic purposes.\r\n        Some of our web pages, promotional email messages, and/or newsletters may contain electronic images known as web beacons, which are also called single-pixel gifs. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information, but they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about the usage of our websites and to track the number of users who have opened and acted up our promotional email messages. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">VI. WHAT ABOUT THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        Some of the banner ads displayed in our websites are provided by third parties. These ads contain cookies and may also contain web beacons. Unlike cookies and web beacons used by JKC in content it controls on its websites, cookies or web beacons received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information. We use third parties to serve some or all of the advertisements that are placed within our sites and they may use information (not including personally identifiable information) about your visits to our sites and other sites to assist in serving advertisements to you. These companies may employ cookies, web beacons, and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. They may share anonymous information with their clients such as date/time of the banner ad shown, the specific ad shown, the IP address, etc. DoubleClick is our primary third party ad server. If you would like to know more about their information gathering practices and “opt-out” procedures, please see http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">VII. HOW CAN YOU CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        We believe that choice in how and when you are contacted is key to customer satisfaction, so we offer several ways for you to update your contact information, change your preferences, or opt out of receiving future communications.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        1.

In those instances, we will retain your information in a “do not promote” file in our database, and you will receive no further communications from us.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        If you have opted out of receiving future emails from us, we will implement your opt-out request within 10 business days of receiving the opt-out request.

SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt important information, such as your credit card data, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access during transmission of your orders over the Internet. We incorporate standard industry practices suitable to the degree of sensitivity of the information involved to maintain the security of your personal information and to avoid its disclosure except as described in this policy. Your personal information may also be protected by the password you created when you registered at our website where this feature is offered. The confidentiality of any password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime by following the instructions at the website where you registered. Although we use our best efforts to assure that your data remains secure when maintained by us, security during Internet transmissions or within any system cannot be assured. JKC employees are made aware of its privacy practices through periodic communications and training. We limit access to personal data only to those JKC employees or agents with a specific need to access or retrieve this information. We store data on multiple service systems, in controlled, secure environments.

If you wish to place an order for products or services online, you must generally establish a credit card account with us or our vendors. Some of our sites also may collect social security numbers from consumers if such consumers of our automotive-related website wish to receive a quote from an automotive lender that is part of the site’s automotive lender network. In such instances, we may collect social security numbers only to fulfill consumers’ requests to receive quotes or other financial offers from a lender in the site’s automotive lender network.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Information Collected Automatically.</span> Our website automatically collects certain information, such as your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times,  and referring website address. This helps facilitate your online experience at our website. See Sections IV and V of this Privacy Policy for more detail on cookies, web beacons, and other information collected automatically by our website.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">II.

A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving promotional offers by mail or email. We also use collected information to evaluate and administer our products and services, respond to any problems that may arise, such as difficulties in navigating our site or accessing certain features, as well as to gauge user trends to determine what products and services are most popular with users, and to put you in touch with fulfillment partners who can provide services that we cannot. We allow users of our website to send articles or links by email to other parties who may be interested in them. We do not retain any email addresses of either the sender or recipient of such articles or links after they are sent, and do not share “send a friend” email addresses with third parties.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">III. HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        We share your personal information only as described below.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Sharing Within JKC.</span> We may share your personal information with any parent company, subsidiary, or affiliate of JKC. All entities within JKC’s corporate family may have access to your personal information as well as anonymous, aggregate demographic data.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">JKC’s Service Providers.</span> JKC may decide to share your personal information with companies that work on behalf of or with JKC. These companies may use your personal information to inform you about JKC’s products and services, to provide you with information about other exciting products and services, or otherwise to assist JKC in serving its customers, understanding its consumer market, or devising effective marketing strategies to reach more consumers.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Lead Purchasers.</span> JKC may decide to share your personal information with third parties who purchase leads from JKC, such as automotive dealers and banks. Some of our websites require users to disclose personal information as a condition of receiving quotes or offers from fulfillment partners (as described more fully below), such as automotive dealers or banks, who can provide services or products to users that JKC does not directly provide. In these instances, your personal information will be provided to third parties who compensate JKC for leads delivered to such third parties.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Participating Vendors.</span> Some of our sites offer opportunities to make purchases online from special participating vendors. On sites with online purchase opportunities for products and merchandise, we will also give participating vendors the order information and authorization for the merchant bank. Any time you order from a participating vendor, that vendor will automatically have all the information related to the order. Participating vendors may use that information to advise you directly of other products and offerings that they provide.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Credit Card Companies.</span> Third Party Payment Services; Third Party Promotional Sites. As in any transaction, your credit card company will have all relevant information about the name of the vendor, item(s) purchased, and date and total cost.

In some cases, we use third party payment and transaction services to facilitate your transactions and process your orders. In such cases, we will share your personal information and credit card information with the third party payment services solely for the purpose of completing the transaction or processing your order. In some cases, we will share your personal information and credit card information with third parties who may offer you a gift or promotional offer as a result of your purchase or subscription to a JKC product or publication.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Fulfillment Partners.</span> Some of our websites are intended to facilitate transactions between you and a third party. To do so, we collect and share additional personal information, like credit information, so such third parties can provide the product or service you request. As our fulfillment partners may keep and use your information whether or not you purchase their products or use their services, your personal information will be subject to their privacy policies.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Other Third Parties.</span> We may share your personal information with third parties, such as advertisers, sponsors, and other promotional and business partners, only when you have not opted out of receiving communications from third parties. If you wish to opt-out of receiving third party communications, you may exercise this right by following the opt-out procedures contained in any email or written communication JKC sends to you or by following the procedures set forth in Section VII of this Privacy Policy.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Public Postings.</span> You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information, personal or otherwise, online in any community area (whether through JKC’s website or any other service available online), that information can be collected and used by others.

In such transactions, user information, whether personally identifiable or otherwise, may be one of the transferred assets.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">IV. HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        Your Web browser offers “cookies” which, if you allow their use, store small amounts of data on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information about you and therefore cannot be used to identify you personally. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best, and also enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your browser and our website is viewable even if you disable the cookie function on your browser. However, if you disable cookies, some advanced and customized features or offerings on our site will not be available to you. In addition to collecting cookies, JKC may distribute, sell, and/or transfer such cookies to third parties with whom JKC has a commercial relationship. If you do not wish your cookies to be used in this manner, you can modify your browser to disable the collection of cookies.\r\n        <br>Additionally, we use third-party companies to collect non-personally identifiable information (e.g., the pages you visit, and which links you click, which ads you see and click on, and the categories of search terms you enter) when you visit one of our websites. Some of these third-party companies collect information when serving ads on our sites, while others collect information without showing ads on our sites. These companies may use the information outlined above (which does not include your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies often use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">V. HOW DO WE USE WEB BEACONS, WEB ANALYTICS, AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MARKETING TECHNOLOGIES?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        A number of technologies exist to assess consumer behavior both on-line and off-line. JKC employs a variety of these technologies, including web beacons (see below), web analytics techniques, and other behavior marketing technologies, to assess consumer behavior and to understand how we can better serve our customers. Many of these technologies are provided to JKC via third party providers specializing in behavioral marketing and consumer behavior. In the course of using these behavioral marketing technologies, we automatically collect non-personal information from you, including but not limited to the following types of information: Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login, email address; computer and connection information such as browser type and related browser data; content viewed; and purchase history, which may be aggregated with other information for analytic purposes.\r\n        <br>Some of our web pages, promotional email messages, and/or newsletters may contain electronic images known as web beacons, which are also called single-pixel gifs. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information, but they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about the usage of our websites and to track the number of users who have opened and acted up our promotional email messages. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">VI. WHAT ABOUT THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        Some of the banner ads displayed in our websites are provided by third parties. These ads contain cookies and may also contain web beacons. Unlike cookies and web beacons used by JKC in content it controls on its websites, cookies or web beacons received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information. We use third parties to serve some or all of the advertisements that are placed within our sites and they may use information (not including personally identifiable information) about your visits to our sites and other sites to assist in serving advertisements to you. These companies may employ cookies, web beacons, and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. They may share anonymous information with their clients such as date/time of the banner ad shown, the specific ad shown, the IP address, etc. DoubleClick is our primary third party ad server. If you would like to know more about their information gathering practices and “opt-out” procedures, please see http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">VII.

SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt important information, such as your credit card data, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access during transmission of your orders over the Internet. We incorporate standard industry practices suitable to the degree of sensitivity of the information involved to maintain the security of your personal information and to avoid its disclosure except as described in this policy. Your personal information may also be protected by the password you created when you registered at our website where this feature is offered. The confidentiality of any password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime by following the instructions at the website where you registered. Although we use our best efforts to assure that your data remains secure when maintained by us, security during Internet transmissions or within any system cannot be assured. JKC employees are made aware of its privacy practices through periodic communications and training. We limit access to personal data only to those JKC employees or agents with a specific need to access or retrieve this information. We store data on multiple service systems, in controlled, secure environments. Remember, however, that we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information, and we are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of any third party.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">IX.

Limitation of Warranties</p>\n<p class="text">JKC PROVIDES THIS WEBSITE AND THE CONTENT, INFORMATION, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ON OR THROUGH IT “AS IS”, AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESSED, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. JKC SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some states may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so check local laws.</p>\n<p class="bold">13. Limitation of Liability</p>\n<p class="text">JKC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT OR SERVICES AT THE SITE OR FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE MATERIALS AT THE SITE WILL BE AVAILABLE, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, THAT THIS SITE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, THAT ALL PRODUCTS LISTED, SOLD OR ADVERTISED ARE AVAILABLE, OR THAT ALL TRANSACTIONS WILL BE COMPLETED. NEITHER JKC NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, LICENSORS OR LICENSEES WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE CONTENT, MATERIALS OR INFORMATION CONTAINED AT THIS SITE ARE CORRECT, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, UP TO DATE, AND/OR RELIABLE.</p>\n<p class="text">IN NO EVENT SHALL JKC OR ANYONE WHO HELPED DEVELOP, CREATE, PRODUCE, DISPLAY, TRANSMIT OR DELIVER THE CONTENT, MATERIAL AND INFORMATION USED IN THIS SITE BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, TREBLE, ENHANCED, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, USE OF OUR SITE, LINKS TO OR FROM THIS SITE, INFORMATION POSTED ON OUR SITE, OUR SERVICES, ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES YOU PURCHASE, OR THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, FOR ACCESSING THIS SITE. NEITHER JKC NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, LICENSORS OR LICENSEES SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES YOU MIGHT SUSTAIN BY ENGAGING IN TRANSACTIONS WITH BUYERS OR SELLERS WHO YOU MEET AS A RESULT OF CLASSIFIED ADVERTISEMENTS POSTED ON ANY JKC WEBSITE. Some states do not allow the limitation of liability, so check local laws.</p>\n<p class="bold">14. Classified Advertisements</p>\n<p class="text">Some of our websites provide a forum (such as classified advertisements) in which sellers and buyers may be connected. By engaging in transactions with buyers or sellers that you meet via one of our websites, you proceed solely at your own risk and you agree that JKC is not responsible for any losses that you might sustain as a result of your transactions with such buyers and sellers. You should not engage in any transaction with a person with whom you are not comfortable or whom you suspect might be engaged in improper or questionable conduct. Please be aware that JKC, through certain of its websites, merely provides a forum in which buyers and sellers can connect. Neither JKC nor its websites posting classified advertisements facilitate any transaction, insure any transaction, or act as an intermediary, broker, or escrow agent in connection with such buyer-seller transactions.</p>\n<p class="text">You should be very careful before you send money to any seller posting an advertisement on one of our sites. In particular, we urge you to use reputable and well known money-transfer services and on-line merchant account services (such as PayPal) in engaging in transactions with sellers of goods advertised on one of our websites. We urge you to proceed with extreme caution in using such money transfer services, and under no circumstances should you deliver cash to a money transfer service with instructions to disburse the funds to an alleged agent of JKC or the website on which the classified advertisement was posted. Again, neither JKC nor its websites posting classified advertisements act as a transaction intermediary or escrow agent, and you should not do business with any seller who directs you to work with an employee or agent of JKC or the applicable website in completing the transaction.</p>\n<p class="bold">15. Indemnity and Hold Harmless</p>\n<p class="text">We are not responsible for the accuracy, quality, safety, legality, intellectual property compliance, privacy policy, or content of any information, product or service offered by users, vendors, advertisers, promotional or business partners or any third-party sites, and you irrevocably waive any claim against JKC and its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, licensors and licensees with respect to the same. JKC does not guarantee such accuracy, and makes no representations regarding the use or results of use of any Content on this site in terms of its accuracy, reliability or any other matter. You assume the risk of their use and the entire cost of all necessary loss, servicing, repair or correction as a result of their use.</p>\n<p class="text">You agree to hold JKC and its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, licensors and licensees harmless from any and all claims, demands, attorneys’ fees, damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known and unknown, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of, or any way connected with the use of any information at this site, any transaction occurring through this site, the safety or quality of any goods or services purchased or sold through this site, or the truth or accuracy of any claim made about such goods or services.</p>\n<p class="text">You also agree to indemnify, defend, and hold JKC and its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, licensors and licensees harmless from any loss, claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of this website, your breach of these Terms of Use or the documents that it incorporates by reference, or your violation of any law or the rights of any third party in connection with your use of this site.</p>\n<p class="bold">16.

Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this Section, JKC may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any federal or state court having jurisdiction in the event of your violation of these TOU and/or your infringement of JKC’s intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of any other person or party.</p>\n<p class="bold">19.

Changes to these TOU shall be effective upon posting. Continued use of the site following the effective date of any changes to these TOU constitutes your acceptance of those changes.</p>\n<p class="bold">20. General Provisions</p>\n<p class="text">(a) Severability. If any provision of these TOU is held to be invalid or unenforceable, it shall be stricken without affecting the validity of the remaining portions of these TOU. Headings are for convenience only, and are not intended in any way to confine, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.</p>\n<p class="text">(b) No Waiver. No waiver by JKC of any breach of these TOU by you shall constitute a waiver of this or any other provision of these TOU or alter or limit our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>\n<p class="text">(c) Entire Agreement. These Terms of Use and the materials incorporated by reference herein, including the JKC Privacy Policy, form the entire understanding and agreement between you and JKC with respect to your use of this site and the services offered hereunder, and may be modified only in accordance with the procedures specified herein.</p>\n<p class="text">(d) No Agency.

JKC SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some states may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so check local laws.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">13. Limitation of Liability</p>\r\n<p class="text">JKC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT OR SERVICES AT THE SITE OR FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE MATERIALS AT THE SITE WILL BE AVAILABLE, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, THAT THIS SITE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, THAT ALL PRODUCTS LISTED, SOLD OR ADVERTISED ARE AVAILABLE, OR THAT ALL TRANSACTIONS WILL BE COMPLETED. NEITHER JKC NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, LICENSORS OR LICENSEES WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS THAT THE CONTENT, MATERIALS OR INFORMATION CONTAINED AT THIS SITE ARE CORRECT, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, UP TO DATE, AND/OR RELIABLE.</p>\r\n<p class="text">IN NO EVENT SHALL JKC OR ANYONE WHO HELPED DEVELOP, CREATE, PRODUCE, DISPLAY, TRANSMIT OR DELIVER THE CONTENT, MATERIAL AND INFORMATION USED IN THIS SITE BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, TREBLE, ENHANCED, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, USE OF OUR SITE, LINKS TO OR FROM THIS SITE, INFORMATION POSTED ON OUR SITE, OUR SERVICES, ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES YOU PURCHASE, OR THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, FOR ACCESSING THIS SITE. NEITHER JKC NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, LICENSORS OR LICENSEES SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES YOU MIGHT SUSTAIN BY ENGAGING IN TRANSACTIONS WITH BUYERS OR SELLERS WHO YOU MEET AS A RESULT OF CLASSIFIED ADVERTISEMENTS POSTED ON ANY JKC WEBSITE. Some states do not allow the limitation of liability, so check local laws.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">14. Classified Advertisements</p>\r\n<p class="text">Some of our websites provide a forum (such as classified advertisements) in which sellers and buyers may be connected. By engaging in transactions with buyers or sellers that you meet via one of our websites, you proceed solely at your own risk and you agree that JKC is not responsible for any losses that you might sustain as a result of your transactions with such buyers and sellers. You should not engage in any transaction with a person with whom you are not comfortable or whom you suspect might be engaged in improper or questionable conduct. Please be aware that JKC, through certain of its websites, merely provides a forum in which buyers and sellers can connect. Neither JKC nor its websites posting classified advertisements facilitate any transaction, insure any transaction, or act as an intermediary, broker, or escrow agent in connection with such buyer-seller transactions.</p>\r\n<p class="text">You should be very careful before you send money to any seller posting an advertisement on one of our sites. In particular, we urge you to use reputable and well known money-transfer services and on-line merchant account services (such as PayPal) in engaging in transactions with sellers of goods advertised on one of our websites. We urge you to proceed with extreme caution in using such money transfer services, and under no circumstances should you deliver cash to a money transfer service with instructions to disburse the funds to an alleged agent of JKC or the website on which the classified advertisement was posted. Again, neither JKC nor its websites posting classified advertisements act as a transaction intermediary or escrow agent, and you should not do business with any seller who directs you to work with an employee or agent of JKC or the applicable website in completing the transaction.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">15. Indemnity and Hold Harmless</p>\r\n<p class="text">We are not responsible for the accuracy, quality, safety, legality, intellectual property compliance, privacy policy, or content of any information, product or service offered by users, vendors, advertisers, promotional or business partners or any third-party sites, and you irrevocably waive any claim against JKC and its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, licensors and licensees with respect to the same. JKC does not guarantee such accuracy, and makes no representations regarding the use or results of use of any Content on this site in terms of its accuracy, reliability or any other matter. You assume the risk of their use and the entire cost of all necessary loss, servicing, repair or correction as a result of their use.</p>\r\n<p class="text">You agree to hold JKC and its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, licensors and licensees harmless from any and all claims, demands, attorneys’ fees, damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known and unknown, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of, or any way connected with the use of any information at this site, any transaction occurring through this site, the safety or quality of any goods or services purchased or sold through this site, or the truth or accuracy of any claim made about such goods or services.</p>\r\n<p class="text">You also agree to indemnify, defend, and hold JKC and its officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents, licensors and licensees harmless from any loss, claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of this website, your breach of these Terms of Use or the documents that it incorporates by reference, or your violation of any law or the rights of any third party in connection with your use of this site.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">16.

In such event, notice shall be deemed given three (3) days after the date of mailing.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">18. Arbitration</p>\r\n<p class="text">Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to your use of the site, or relating to these TOU or the Privacy Policy, or to the services provided by JKC shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any such controversy or claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this Section, JKC may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any federal or state court having jurisdiction in the event of your violation of these TOU and/or your infringement of JKC’s intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of any other person or party.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">19. Modifications to these Terms of Use</p>\r\n<p class="text">JKC reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these TOU at any time, so please check this site or any other JKC website you use periodically for changes. Changes to these TOU shall be effective upon posting. Continued use of the site following the effective date of any changes to these TOU constitutes your acceptance of those changes.</p>\r\n<p class="bold">20. General Provisions</p>\r\n<p class="text">(a) Severability. If any provision of these TOU is held to be invalid or unenforceable, it shall be stricken without affecting the validity of the remaining portions of these TOU. Headings are for convenience only, and are not intended in any way to confine, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.</p>\r\n<p class="text">(b) No Waiver. No waiver by JKC of any breach of these TOU by you shall constitute a waiver of this or any other provision of these TOU or alter or limit our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>\r\n<p class="text">(c) Entire Agreement. These Terms of Use and the materials incorporated by reference herein, including the JKC Privacy Policy, form the entire understanding and agreement between you and JKC with respect to your use of this site and the services offered hereunder, and may be modified only in accordance with the procedures specified herein.</p>\r\n<p class="text">(d) No Agency.

We do not retain any email addresses of either the sender or recipient of such articles or links after they are sent, and do not share “send a friend” email addresses with third parties.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">III.

HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        Your Web browser offers “cookies” which, if you allow their use, store small amounts of data on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information about you and therefore cannot be used to identify you personally. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best, and also enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your browser and our website is viewable even if you disable the cookie function on your browser. However, if you disable cookies, some advanced and customized features or offerings on our site will not be available to you. In addition to collecting cookies, JKC may distribute, sell, and/or transfer such cookies to third parties with whom JKC has a commercial relationship. If you do not wish your cookies to be used in this manner, you can modify your browser to disable the collection of cookies.\r\n        <br>Additionally, we use third-party companies to collect non-personally identifiable information (e.g., the pages you visit, and which links you click, which ads you see and click on, and the categories of search terms you enter) when you visit one of our websites. Some of these third-party companies collect information when serving ads on our sites, while others collect information without showing ads on our sites. These companies may use the information outlined above (which does not include your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies often use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">V. HOW DO WE USE WEB BEACONS, WEB ANALYTICS, AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MARKETING TECHNOLOGIES?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        A number of technologies exist to assess consumer behavior both on-line and off-line. JKC employs a variety of these technologies, including web beacons (see below), web analytics techniques, and other behavior marketing technologies, to assess consumer behavior and to understand how we can better serve our customers. Many of these technologies are provided to JKC via third party providers specializing in behavioral marketing and consumer behavior. In the course of using these behavioral marketing technologies, we automatically collect non-personal information from you, including but not limited to the following types of information: Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login, email address; computer and connection information such as browser type and related browser data; content viewed; and purchase history, which may be aggregated with other information for analytic purposes.\r\n        <br>Some of our web pages, promotional email messages, and/or newsletters may contain electronic images known as web beacons, which are also called single-pixel gifs. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information, but they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about the usage of our websites and to track the number of users who have opened and acted up our promotional email messages. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">VI.

These ads contain cookies and may also contain web beacons. Unlike cookies and web beacons used by JKC in content it controls on its websites, cookies or web beacons received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information. We use third parties to serve some or all of the advertisements that are placed within our sites and they may use information (not including personally identifiable information) about your visits to our sites and other sites to assist in serving advertisements to you. These companies may employ cookies, web beacons, and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. They may share anonymous information with their clients such as date/time of the banner ad shown, the specific ad shown, the IP address, etc. DoubleClick is our primary third party ad server.

We urge you to read the complete Privacy Policy set forth below, as well as our Terms and Conditions of Use, and contact us if you have any questions.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">I. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Personal Information.</span> We collect personally identifiable information, such as names, mailing addresses, email addresses, demographic information, and similar information in a variety of situations, including but not limited to the following: (i) when you register at our website in connection with the purchase of a product, publication, or service; (ii) when you enter personal information on our website as a condition of participating in contests, promotions, or sweepstakes offered via the website; or (iii) when you wish to have a product or service fulfilled by a fulfillment partner who can meet the continuing needs of our customers.\r\n        Our site may collect credit card and related financial information if you wish to purchase a product or subscribe to any publication or service offered via the site. If you wish to place an order for products or services online, you must generally establish a credit card account with us or our vendors. Some of our sites also may collect social security numbers from consumers if such consumers of our automotive-related website wish to receive a quote from an automotive lender that is part of the site’s automotive lender network. In such instances, we may collect social security numbers only to fulfill consumers’ requests to receive quotes or other financial offers from a lender in the site’s automotive lender network.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Information Collected Automatically.</span> Our website automatically collects certain information, such as your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times,  and referring website address. This helps facilitate your online experience at our website. See Sections IV and V of this Privacy Policy for more detail on cookies, web beacons, and other information collected automatically by our website.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">II. WHAT DO WE DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">We use the personal information you provide to allow you to make product purchases, to fulfill your requests, improve our publications, products and services, to send you promotional offers related to JKC or our business partners, and to operate our business. A user may, at any time, opt out of receiving promotional offers by mail or email. We also use collected information to evaluate and administer our products and services, respond to any problems that may arise, such as difficulties in navigating our site or accessing certain features, as well as to gauge user trends to determine what products and services are most popular with users, and to put you in touch with fulfillment partners who can provide services that we cannot. We allow users of our website to send articles or links by email to other parties who may be interested in them. We do not retain any email addresses of either the sender or recipient of such articles or links after they are sent, and do not share “send a friend” email addresses with third parties.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">III. HOW DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        We share your personal information only as described below.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Sharing Within JKC.</span> We may share your personal information with any parent company, subsidiary, or affiliate of JKC. All entities within JKC’s corporate family may have access to your personal information as well as anonymous, aggregate demographic data.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">JKC’s Service Providers.</span> JKC may decide to share your personal information with companies that work on behalf of or with JKC. These companies may use your personal information to inform you about JKC’s products and services, to provide you with information about other exciting products and services, or otherwise to assist JKC in serving its customers, understanding its consumer market, or devising effective marketing strategies to reach more consumers.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Lead Purchasers.</span> JKC may decide to share your personal information with third parties who purchase leads from JKC, such as automotive dealers and banks. Some of our websites require users to disclose personal information as a condition of receiving quotes or offers from fulfillment partners (as described more fully below), such as automotive dealers or banks, who can provide services or products to users that JKC does not directly provide. In these instances, your personal information will be provided to third parties who compensate JKC for leads delivered to such third parties.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Participating Vendors.</span> Some of our sites offer opportunities to make purchases online from special participating vendors. On sites with online purchase opportunities for products and merchandise, we will also give participating vendors the order information and authorization for the merchant bank. Any time you order from a participating vendor, that vendor will automatically have all the information related to the order. Participating vendors may use that information to advise you directly of other products and offerings that they provide.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Credit Card Companies.</span> Third Party Payment Services; Third Party Promotional Sites. As in any transaction, your credit card company will have all relevant information about the name of the vendor, item(s) purchased, and date and total cost. JKC will not otherwise provide any personal data to your credit card company. In some cases, we use third party payment and transaction services to facilitate your transactions and process your orders. In such cases, we will share your personal information and credit card information with the third party payment services solely for the purpose of completing the transaction or processing your order. In some cases, we will share your personal information and credit card information with third parties who may offer you a gift or promotional offer as a result of your purchase or subscription to a JKC product or publication.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Fulfillment Partners.</span> Some of our websites are intended to facilitate transactions between you and a third party. To do so, we collect and share additional personal information, like credit information, so such third parties can provide the product or service you request. As our fulfillment partners may keep and use your information whether or not you purchase their products or use their services, your personal information will be subject to their privacy policies.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Other Third Parties.</span> We may share your personal information with third parties, such as advertisers, sponsors, and other promotional and business partners, only when you have not opted out of receiving communications from third parties. If you wish to opt-out of receiving third party communications, you may exercise this right by following the opt-out procedures contained in any email or written communication JKC sends to you or by following the procedures set forth in Section VII of this Privacy Policy.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Public Postings.</span> You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information, personal or otherwise, online in any community area (whether through JKC’s website or any other service available online), that information can be collected and used by others. Accordingly, you should use caution when sharing any personal information with others in any community area (whether through JKC’s website or any other service available online).\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Required Disclosures of Information.</span> We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request; to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect the integrity of our sites and our property and assure adherence to our terms of use; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation or process.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        <span class="bold">Changes in Corporate Structure.</span> In developing our business, we might sell certain assets, or the company, or parts of it, may be sold, merged or otherwise transferred. In such transactions, user information, whether personally identifiable or otherwise, may be one of the transferred assets.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">IV. HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        Your Web browser offers “cookies” which, if you allow their use, store small amounts of data on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information about you and therefore cannot be used to identify you personally. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best, and also enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your browser and our website is viewable even if you disable the cookie function on your browser. However, if you disable cookies, some advanced and customized features or offerings on our site will not be available to you. In addition to collecting cookies, JKC may distribute, sell, and/or transfer such cookies to third parties with whom JKC has a commercial relationship. If you do not wish your cookies to be used in this manner, you can modify your browser to disable the collection of cookies.\r\n        Additionally, we use third-party companies to collect non-personally identifiable information (e.g., the pages you visit, and which links you click, which ads you see and click on, and the categories of search terms you enter) when you visit one of our websites. Some of these third-party companies collect information when serving ads on our sites, while others collect information without showing ads on our sites. These companies may use the information outlined above (which does not include your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies often use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">V. HOW DO WE USE WEB BEACONS, WEB ANALYTICS, AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MARKETING TECHNOLOGIES?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        A number of technologies exist to assess consumer behavior both on-line and off-line. JKC employs a variety of these technologies, including web beacons (see below), web analytics techniques, and other behavior marketing technologies, to assess consumer behavior and to understand how we can better serve our customers. Many of these technologies are provided to JKC via third party providers specializing in behavioral marketing and consumer behavior. In the course of using these behavioral marketing technologies, we automatically collect non-personal information from you, including but not limited to the following types of information: Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login, email address; computer and connection information such as browser type and related browser data; content viewed; and purchase history, which may be aggregated with other information for analytic purposes.\r\n        Some of our web pages, promotional email messages, and/or newsletters may contain electronic images known as web beacons, which are also called single-pixel gifs. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information, but they are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about the usage of our websites and to track the number of users who have opened and acted up our promotional email messages. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">VI. WHAT ABOUT THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        Some of the banner ads displayed in our websites are provided by third parties. These ads contain cookies and may also contain web beacons. Unlike cookies and web beacons used by JKC in content it controls on its websites, cookies or web beacons received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information. We use third parties to serve some or all of the advertisements that are placed within our sites and they may use information (not including personally identifiable information) about your visits to our sites and other sites to assist in serving advertisements to you. These companies may employ cookies, web beacons, and action tags to measure advertising effectiveness. They may share anonymous information with their clients such as date/time of the banner ad shown, the specific ad shown, the IP address, etc. DoubleClick is our primary third party ad server. If you would like to know more about their information gathering practices and “opt-out” procedures, please see http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">VII. HOW CAN YOU CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        We believe that choice in how and when you are contacted is key to customer satisfaction, so we offer several ways for you to update your contact information, change your preferences, or opt out of receiving future communications.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        1.	If you have an online account at our website, you may be able to log on and update or change your contact or account information.

You also may write to us directly if you wish to: (a) update or delete your contact information; (b) ask that we not share your personal information with third parties; or (c) request that we cease sending you promotional or other information via mail or email. Such written requests should be sent to Jean Knows Cars via email at feedback@jeanknowscars.com, with Legal Department in the subject line. In those instances, we will retain your information in a “do not promote” file in our database, and you will receive no further communications from us.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        If you have opted out of receiving future emails from us, we will implement your opt-out request within 10 business days of receiving the opt-out request. If you have opted out of receiving future promotional materials by regular mail, we will implement your opt-out request within a commercially reasonable time.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">VIII. SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt important information, such as your credit card data, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access during transmission of your orders over the Internet. We incorporate standard industry practices suitable to the degree of sensitivity of the information involved to maintain the security of your personal information and to avoid its disclosure except as described in this policy. Your personal information may also be protected by the password you created when you registered at our website where this feature is offered. The confidentiality of any password is yours to protect. You may change it anytime by following the instructions at the website where you registered. Although we use our best efforts to assure that your data remains secure when maintained by us, security during Internet transmissions or within any system cannot be assured. JKC employees are made aware of its privacy practices through periodic communications and training. We limit access to personal data only to those JKC employees or agents with a specific need to access or retrieve this information. We store data on multiple service systems, in controlled, secure environments. Remember, however, that we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information, and we are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of any third party.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">IX. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        Our website is intended for adults. Some content intended for teens 13 and older may include features or material that may be appealing to children under the age of 13. JKC is strongly committed to protecting the safety and privacy of children who visit our websites. We do not knowingly collect personal information online from children under 13. Our site may contain interactive content such as chat rooms, bulletin boards and other features that may be unsuitable for children under 13 and which are not necessarily monitored. We encourage all parents to talk to their children about online safety and to monitor their children’s use of the Internet.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">X. THIRD PARTIES AND LINKS</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        In the event that you provide personal information to any third party via any JKC website or any offer made available to you by JKC, you understand that JKC is not responsible for such third parties’ use or misuse of your personal information. You should review the privacy and information sharing practices of such third parties. Additionally, JKC may offer links to or from websites it controls to other sites within the JKC family as well as to sites operated by third parties. We offer links to third party sites so that you can conveniently visit our vendors and advertisers or locate other content likely to be of interest. We are not responsible for the content, practices or policies of sites operated by third parties and urge you to inquire about them before providing any personally identifiable information.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">XI. VISITORS AND SUBSCRIBERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES</p>\r\n    <p class="text">\r\n        All matters relating to these sites are governed by the laws of the State of Michigan in the United States. Any information you provide in subscribing to one of our publications or registering or ordering at one of our websites will be transferred to the United States. By visiting our sites and submitting information, you authorize this transfer, processing and use.\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n    <p class="bold">XII.
