  "Bio" : "My return to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee during the Reagan era for a second bachelor?s degree accomplished two things: I made writing for a car magazine a career goal, and I met my future wife, though it took Donna two decades to come around to the latter idea. Over that quarter-century, I went on to write general assignment stories for the <em>Milwaukee Sentinel</em>, became a cop reporter, then schools reporter and film critic for the <em>Quad-City Times</em>, where I also covered Cary Grant?s death in Davenport, Iowa, and then I worked for the <em>San Diego Business Journal</em>, where I became an expert on the arcane America?s Cup Deed of Gift. When I moved to Washington, D.C., where I wrote about the Clinton health care reform plan and other Capitol Hill issues for an inside-the-beltway newsletter publisher, I thought I had found my true calling. Matt DeLorenzo convinced me otherwise, and I moved to Detroit in 1996 to work for <em>AutoWeek</em>. Four years later, Jack Keebler lured me to <em>Motor Trend</em>, where I wrote news and rumors about future cars, voted in a dozen (each) Car of the Year and Sport/Utility of the Year competitions, and blogged as the Motor City Blogman. Detroit is to the global auto industry what Washington is to national politics. It?s easily more fascinating and as frustrating to cover as a journalist. The commute is far more interesting. \n<br><br>\nMy years at <em>Motor Trend</em>, working side-by-side with Technical Director Frank Markus, have been enormously fulfilling. I?ve become fully immersed in the nuts and bolts of cars, and the industry. You have to keep a love for cars and driving in perspective. For me, Donna, our two collies, and my family back in Wisconsin come first. I can be nearly as passionate about politics, movies and art, and the Green Bay Packers, of which I?m a shareholder. My favorite sport is still Formula 1, though.\n<br><br>\n<em>Automobile</em> is about living with cars, both the good ones and the bad ones, but most importantly, the most interesting ones. With autonomous cars on the near horizon, we face the greatest threat to our enthusiasm since the malaise and oil embargoes of the ?70s, the era when I earned my driver?s license. With Jean, Joe and their crew, <em>Automobile</em> already has the best, most interesting writers to explain why you should put down that mobile phone and grab the steering wheel. I?m thrilled to become part of this team and I look forward to helping place the cars and the way we drive them in context.",

  "Bio" : "Vanity would have me believe you?re reading this because you?re a devoted fan of my writing. In that case, you may want to know that I also edit the magazine?s Ignition section, read lots of Kurt Vonnegut, and would eat sushi at every meal if it were socially acceptable. Reality tells me you just want to know how I landed this amazing job. Fine. Based on my experience, here?s some advice.<br/><br/>\n\n1)\tMajor in journalism. Most of us here aren?t racecar drivers -- we?re writers and reporters. It probably helps if you?ve attended journalism school, as I did at the University of Maryland, or worked for some periodical. That said, deputy editor Joe DeMatio now claims he was more intrigued by my second degree in Jewish studies, even though he?s never once asked me to write about the exploits of Simon bar Kochba. <br/>\n2)\tKnow how to operate a manual transmission. Seems obvious, but I actually did not upon being hired. I taught myself during my first month on the job by visiting six Ann Arbor dealerships to test drive stick-shift economy cars. My sincere apologies to whoever ended up buying that Ford Focus. <br/>\n3)\tLearn everything you can about cars. I grew up pouring over car magazines and memorizing zero-to-sixty times as if they were catechism. People have been asking me for car-buying advice since before I could drive. <br/>\n4)\tRealize you actually know nothing about cars. A brief conversation with design editor Robert Cumberford, editor-in-chief Jean Jennings, or any other of the veterans here leaves you humbled and astounded by their wealth of automotive knowledge. It?s truly one of the best parts of working here.  <br/>\n5)\tBe persistent. I wrote to <em>Automobile</em>?s editors. And called. And wrote them some more. <br/>\n6)\tBe lucky. I really have no idea why deputy editor Joe DeMatio answered my unsolicited voicemail. I hadn?t even pronounced his name correctly (it?s De-MAY-shee-oh, not De-MAH-tee-oh). But he did, and here I am, driving cars and writing about them for my devoted fans.",

  "Bio" : "Robert Cumberford is a designer who became a writer by accident. His race report on the 12 Hours of Sebring was published when he was an eighteen-year-old Art Center student in 1954. Subsequently he has published thousands of articles on cars and airplanes, in American, Asian, English, European, and South American magazines. He contributed to several books, including the entire text of the well-reviewed <em>Auto Legends</em>, now available in five translated editions -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Polish in addition to the original English version. In 1985, <em>Automobile Magazine</em> founder David E. Davis, Jr., invited him to be one of two executive editors when <em>Automobile</em> was in the planning stages. Cumberford demurred, saying he knew nothing about magazine production and claims he still doesn?t, except that it?s important to meet deadlines. He contributed features from the beginning and began his popular ?By Design? column in the sixth issue, September 1986.  \n<br /><br />\nIn car design, Cumberford was even more a youthful prodigy. He sketched the body for the first car ever built to his designs when he was a fifteen-year-old Los Angeles high-school student. That car, the Parkinson Jaguar Special, is still active in historic racing sixty years after it was created. Hired directly by General Motors? legendary Vice President of Design, Harley J. Earl, Cumberford became a professional car designer at nineteen. Leaving Detroit, he returned to California to attend UCLA to study philosophy. He rejoined the automotive world in the early 1960s and has continued to create new automotive shapes since then, always as an independent design consultant. He has lived and worked in six of the fifty United States and in France, Mexico, and Switzerland. The range of his design projects includes both racing and touring cars, trucks, aircraft, boats, hovercraft, and even ecological architecture. \n<br /><br />\nHe is known worldwide for strong opinions but is well-respected in the design world because it is known that he is always completely honest in his views, with no agenda other than respect for good design and good designers. ?There?s no ad hominem,? he says, ?I judge the design, not the designers. There are designers I really like personally who?ve been credited with designs I heartily dislike -- for reasons I always state very clearly -- and designs I love done by people with whom I have absolutely no affinity. Except that we both like their work.?",

  "Bio" : "When <em>Automobile</em> launched in 1986, my byline appeared on a sidebar to the cover story written by our founding editor David E. Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn?t inevitable that I?d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I?ve written for <em>Bon App?tit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (?Detroit?s Premier Business Journal?) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I?ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (?Blood Red to Goodwood,? March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for ?Three Zero Heroes,? I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for ?Substance over Style.?\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver?s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors? favor, but also in the co-driver?s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there?s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I?m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.",

  "Bio" : "\"How many cupholders does it have?\"<br><br>\nThat's the question expected from my colleagues at Automotive.com. Like the rest of the Automotive.com staff, I bring my own unique take on cars. Big difference is that I rediscovered my love for all things automotive only in the past decade, instead of right out of the womb. <br><br>\nInstead, I pursued interests in decidedly non-car fields?like business, fiction writing, and database administration?working in such fields like admin assistant (formerly called secretaries), data entry, technical writer, and website maintenance. It was in 2005 that I reignited my love affair with the car. I was researching the all-new Pontiac G6 to replace our aging Mazda 626 when I discovered Autoblog. The site was always hungry for new car news which I happily obliged, sending 30 new articles a day to the editors. Finally, they contacted me and asked if I'd like to write for the website as a freelancer. I said yes (of course), and for the next two years faithfully submitted materials even on the weekends. My very first post covered the exotic Pagani Zonda; I also wrote about car resale values; most popular paint colors; and which one had the best/worse feng shui. A year later I wrote for Autoblog Green, covering the more environmentally-friendly side of the car industry, from biodegradable car seats to hybrids and full-electric cars. <br><br>\nIn 2006, I joined Automotive.com, first as an assistant web producer, then lead writer for three (now defunct) blogs: The Car Blog, The BMW Blog, and The Ford Blog. I provided the content for Automotive.com's own blog when it went live later that year, first as lead writer, then editor, managing a team composed of freelancers and other assistant web producers. Later, I contributed posts to the Motor Trend and Automobile Magazine websites. In mid-2011, I joined the Automotive.com team currently shepherd by News Director Keith Buglewicz. <br><br>\nThis background, with its emphasis on a wide variety of car news, reflects in my coverage and interest. I can?and am willing?to discuss engine power and handling on such enthusiast topics like Mercedes-Benz's latest AMG supercar, but I'd also happily coo over the Toyota Sienna's storage space, or residual values from Chevrolet, or Porsche's latest compact crossover. When not covering cars, I enjoy reading, working out, playing tabletop role-playing games with friends, and planning my next overseas vacation. Australia's looking mighty fine at the moment.",

As a child I would spend hours arranging toy cars in elaborate races on the living room floor, and once spent time on a vacation in France reading the owner's manual to my parents' Ford Mondeo. The first auto show I attended was in Birmingham; after moving to Michigan I began attending the Detroit auto show almost every year. I couldn't wait to take driver's ed., get my driver's license at age 16, and tirelessly polish my slightly rusty first car. <br><br>\n\nBy the time I entered the University of Michigan, I had decided I wanted to pursue journalism and began writing for the student paper. But I also had an internship at <em>Car and Driver</em>, and quickly realized that cars were the only thing I was truly interested in reporting on. After all, countless teachers and professors had passed on the wisdom that you should, \"Write what you know.\" I pursued that interest after graduation and managed to land a job at <em>Automobile Magazine</em>, just down the street from where I'd studied for the prior four years. <br><br>\n\nFast forward to today, and I've been fortunate enough to attend auto shows on three different continents. I've learned to drive sports cars like a Fiat 500 Abarth on a race track, and spent a week eking mileage out of a Nissan Leaf electric car. <br><br>\n\nAlthough I love driving new cars, one of my favorite parts of this job is having the opportunity to meet the people responsible for those cars. Whether it's the executives speaking at launches or engineers revealing tech secrets at auto shows, I love being able to get a feel for how things work behind the scenes. <br><br>\n\nThe most surprising part about this job is that I've become the de facto go-to for friends or family members who have questions or want advice about cars. Surprisingly enough, not everybody I talk to wants to buy a two-seat sports car.",

You really feel that you?re in charge: in charge of the car, in charge of the road, and in charge of your life. Why on earth would you want someone else to drive you around when you could do it yourself? It?s so liberating! Obviously, I love driving. I suppose that isn't a particularly original statement for a Detroit native, but it's true. I was a little late getting my driver's license because of that pesky parallel parking, but once I got it, nothing could stop me. It doesn't matter if I have to chauffeur my grandmother to the bank less than a block from our house or drive across town. If I have my green Chrysler LHS--affectionately christened \"Betsy\" by my mother--and some gas in the tank, and if I am somehow able to avoid getting pulled over for driving just a little too fast, I'm good to go.\n\nSince I graduated from the University of Michigan, in April 2012, Betsy has taken me everywhere. She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn?t as dry as a piece of chalk?And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there. Not only am I a bibliophile, but I?m also a self-proclaimed Anglophile who loves Shakespeare and Elizabethan verse and one day plans to see the Houses of Parliament, visit the Tower of London, and, perhaps most important, eat real fish and chips. If only I could drive Betsy \"across the pond?\"",

  "Bio" : "I have been mixed up with automotive media since the mid-1980s, when I was one of the first staffers at Automobile Magazine. I worked there from the third issue to the tenth-anniversary issue, so I?m no stranger to startups. Since then, I have been an at-home mom with my four kids for about seventeen years. They turned out to be, in birth order: a jazz guitarist; a voracious reader who was born forty years too late to be a member of the Beat Generation; a classical violinist; and my youngest, who shows promise as an automotive enthusiast. Now I'm back at JeanKnowsCars.com and prepared to stick around until age eighty, or longer.  \n\nI studied journalism at the University of Michigan and the University of Strasbourg, France. Before that, I attended a hippie boarding school in Sedona, Arizona, and then earned the distinction of dropping out of the same college where Steve Jobs dropped out (Reed College), less than a year after he did. I have also written and edited for many automotive publications and websites and for <em>Twins </em>magazine, where I wrote a regular column for several years in between driving to music lessons and on school field trips in my minivan. <br>\n<br>\nYes, I drive a minivan. Actually, I think minivans are awesome for their storage and people-carrying ability, for their excellent visibility, and for the fact that cops conveniently overlook how fast a mom in a minivan might be driving because they?re hoping to stop a red sports car instead. I have taken several long cross-country adventure drives in my life: excursions of 5,000 miles or more, both<em> as </em>a teenager and <em>with</em> teenagers. Florida? California? Washington State? Washington, D.C.? If there's a plane that goes there...I'll get in the car and drive there anyway. I strongly believe that enjoyment of cars and driving is for everybody, including me and including you.",

  "Bio" : "I have spent a lot of time on the road. I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden?a 15-hour drive?through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards?Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:",

  "Bio" : "Sheer serendipity.  That?s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  ?You should write about cars from your perspective ? a 4?11? single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey? You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.?  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise ? B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, ?You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.?\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I?m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today?s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don?t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)",

  "Bio" : "Despite the fact that I grew up just outside of Detroit, I was never particularly infatuated with cars. It wasn't until I headed to Washington, D.C., and began working for an environmental trade journal that I got an up close and personal look at what it takes to design an automobile. My first articles focused on efforts by legislators to make once heavily polluting cars run cleaner. When I moved back to Michigan, that became my focus as I contributed extensively to the Detroit bureaus of both the New York <em>Times</em> and <em>Newsweek. </em>I became fascinated by how the automobile impacts so many aspects of our lives and reflects our styles and preferences. \n\nOver the past two dozen years as a freelancer, I've covered the auto industry for a wide variety of publications, including <em>Popular Mechanics, Scientific American,</em> iVillage, A<em>utomotive News, Ad Age, Hemispheres, Technology Review,</em> and <em>AARP. </em>I've also contributed pieces on air to public radio. My coverage has focused on such issues as the ways domestic automakers will respond to increasingly tough mandates for fuel-efficient cars while still designing vehicles that appeal to consumers, and my firsthand?and slightly scary?experience driving an autonomous car. But my stories are less about the vehicle than the person driving it. I'm most intrigued by the way people shape cars and cars shape those who drive them.",

Except for motherhood, but that's its own reward, right?\n\nI was a record store geek back when there were record stores, and worked at the venerable (and late, lamented) Schoolkids' Records in Ann Arbor through college, while spinning jazz records at WEMU to the taxi drivers, barflies and night owls who listened during the wee hours. I then spent a dozen years as the corporate jazz buyer for the Borders Books & Music chain, a job that even in hindsight seems too good to be true.  After the music business--and Borders-imploded, I pursued another passion and joined the staff of AnnArbor.com as a food writer and community content coordinator. I spend a lot of time cooking, eating and writing, which also often feels too good to be true.\n \nAnd now cars. I?ve been a car geek since I could walk. I caught the bug from my dad, who saved up the paychecks he earned pumping gas as a teen in western New York until he could afford a gorgeous vintage 1939 Oldsmobile. My first car was my parents? old Dodge Spirit--an innocuous-looking car that hid a turbocharged V6 under the hood. That car took me all over the country--and fast. If I shoved a Kleenex in the tape player to stop the rattling, I could easily cruise at 120 mph, a thought that now--as a mom--strikes fear in my heart.",

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler?s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine?s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI?ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America?s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, ?Vile Gossip,? including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I?m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC?s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN?s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I?m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I?m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don?t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

  "Bio" : "When I turned sixteen, my dad brought home the very first-generation Ford Escort wagon, and it just so happened to have a manual transmission. Since?like every other sixteen-year-old?I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan?s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can?t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.",

  "Bio" : "I was born a suburban Detroit gal where the preoccupation with cars is practically genetic.  As a young adult I kicked around motor-racing, training to drive while I worked at a Brands Hatch satellite in Miami.  I've been race staff at the Detroit Grand Prix, worked TV coverage of Formula 1, Indy and NASCAR and done the occasional ride and drive program.  Eventually my racing aspirations gave way to a long held interest in filmmaking and I got my B.A. from the University of Michigan's burgeoning film program.  U of M taught me to write and introduced me to my excellent husband.  We spent five adventurous years in Los Angeles in the entertainment and publishing industries before returning to Ann Arbor where our lovely daughter came into the world.  Personally, I expend a good deal of energy on K-12 public education advocacy.  Professionally, I've been a freelance writer for the last ten years specializing in health issues and automotive content from a lifestyle perspective.  There's a lot more to auto life than zero to sixty.",

  "Bio" : "I am a person who loves to study other people. I like to interview them, learn about their lives, photograph them, and write their stories. The people at Jean Knows Cars noticed me through my project, Humans of Ann Arbor. In that project, I tool around the city of Ann Arbor, introducing myself to anyone who draws my eye. If they are open to it, I take a photo of them and hear a little bit about them. Then I post the photos and stories on Facebook. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/HumansofAnnArbor\" rel=\"?nofollow?\" target=\"?_blank?\">Humans  of Ann  Arbor</a>  has followers from all over the world who check in on a daily basis to see ordinary people and their extraordinary stories.\n\nI have been studying people since I was a little girl in Missouri. Where I grew up, studying people often led you to the cars they loved. My grandpa had a gas station in Claycomo, Missouri, which he opened in the 1950s, and he passed his love of cars and taking care of the people who drove them down to my dad. Dad was a mechanic and a service supervisor all his life. We had a steady barrage of cars coming into our lives?mostly Chevys. To impress my dad, I learned to identify every car I could, and I used to name the cars while we drove down the road. Car culture is big in Missouri. Would you believe that I had friends who were sisters named Nova and Chevelle? If\nyou didn?t grow up the way I did, you might not get the significance of that, but suffice it to say that my people love their cars.\n\nThe car I adored most was the Chevrolet Corvair my dad gave me when I was in high school. It spent more time in my dad's shop than it did on the road, but in those moments when it was drivable, I knew what it was to love a car. It was a thing of beauty: pale cream with a plaid madras interior. I loved the sound and feel of the engine?it was more like a soft purr than a roar. I can still remember how it smelled and what it was like to drive it with the windows rolled down on a warm day. I've had lots of cars since then, and I loved some of them, too. But the Corvair was my first car love and will always be my favorite.\n\nAfter high school, I drove my car to Springfield, Missouri, to study communications at Missouri State. Later, I drove a different car to Chicago to study photography at Columbia College. I worked in Chicago as a freelance photographer and studio manager for many years before moving to Ann Arbor, where I continue to do freelance photography. I am excited about combining my love of studying people with my interest in cars. I want to explore how cars serve us, how they are intertwined in our lives, and what makes us love them. I can't wait to let you know what I find out.",
