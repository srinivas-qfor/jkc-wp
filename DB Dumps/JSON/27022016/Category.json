  "description" : "Chevrolet, a General Motors brand, has distinguished itself by offering a car for every category of person from entry-level to family to off-road vehicles and beyond. Its pickup is second only in sales to Ford's F-150, and of course it makes America?s supercar, the Corvette. Chevrolet also offers a large number of cars that get 30 to 40 miles per gallon, easing the cost burden to owners. After 100 years in the business, Chevrolet has had an amazing number of engineering innovations, and is now at its highest level of design in decades. In recent years, Chevrolet's greatest innovation is the Volt, executed in the midst of General Motors? bankruptcy, and very high tech at the time it was launched. Chevy may be a populist car company, but that doesn?t mean it's not worth its salt.",

The Toyota badge is famous for its utter reliability, though its reputation for a very high level of quality has taken a beating in recent years. Toyota hard at working earning that reputation back, and is adding a little zip to their cars in the process. A Toyota might not set your heart pounding, but it will get you where you need to go today, tomorrow, and for a very long time to come.",

Volvos aren?t very sporty, they?re not very luxurious, and they?re not very stylish, but they are safe, comfortable, reliable, and reasonably good looking.",
