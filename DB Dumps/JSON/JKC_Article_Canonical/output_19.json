It has a masculine, no-frills feeling inside and a slightly more aggressive appearance outside, with special eighteen-inch wheels and tires, a stiffer suspension, and better noise insulation—including an extra layer of acoustic barrier in the windshield.

I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-19T12:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-beetle-dune-homepage","title":"2016 Beetle Dune Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160567172/2016-beetle-dune-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":160567172,"fileName":"2016-beetle-dune-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-19T12:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-beetle-dune-homepage","title":"2016 Beetle Dune Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160567172/2016-beetle-dune-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":160567172,"fileName":"2016-beetle-dune-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-19T12:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-beetle-dune-header","title":"2016 Beetle Dune Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95025100/2016-beetle-dune-header.jpg","fileMasterId":95025100,"fileName":"2016-beetle-dune-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":977660,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Four-door, front- or all-wheel-drive, seven-passenger crossover utility vehicle <br>\r\n<strong>Release date:</strong> Spring 2016 <br>\r\n<strong>Estimated price:</strong> Low $30,000s <br>\r\n<strong>Competes against:</strong> Chevrolet Traverse, Ford Edge, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Nissan Pathfinder <br>\r\n<strong>What’s most interesting:</strong> Turbocharged four-cylinder engine <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Look at the 2016 Mazda CX-9 in either of two ways.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-07T19:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-chevrolet-camaro-homepage","title":"2016 Chevrolet Camaro Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96813751/2016-chevrolet-camaro-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":96813751,"fileName":"2016-chevrolet-camaro-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-07T19:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-chevrolet-camaro-homepage","title":"2016 Chevrolet Camaro Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96813751/2016-chevrolet-camaro-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":96813751,"fileName":"2016-chevrolet-camaro-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-07T19:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-chevrolet-camaro-header","title":"2016 Chevrolet Camaro Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96813748/2016-chevrolet-camaro-header.jpg","fileMasterId":96813748,"fileName":"2016-chevrolet-camaro-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":979404,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, rear-wheel-drive sport coupe<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> 1LT, 2LT, 1SS, 2SS<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $42,295 (price includes destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $45,385<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 6.2-liter V-8, 455 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Eight-speed automatic with paddle shifters <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 20 mpg city/28 mpg highway <br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: Not yet rated; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: Not yet rated<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Side blind zone alert<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Apple CarPlay, OnStar 4G LTE with wireless hot spot, rearview camera, wireless phone charging, SS appearance package, Brembo brakes<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Magnetic Ride Control, dual-mode exhaust, sunroof <br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> <br>\n2016 Ford Mustang GT Premium ($37,295)<br>\n2016 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 ($48,695)<br>\n2016 Dodge Challenger SRT 392 ($51,190) <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Can you believe that Chevy’s sixth-generation 2016 Camaro marks the nameplate’s forty-eighth year in existence?</strong> Just to remind us all, this fall Chevrolet invited what seems like every automotive journalist in the United States (including me) on their forty-eight-state launch celebration.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-22T13:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-cadillac-cts-v-promo","title":"2016 Cadillac Cts V Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/163523117/2016-cadillac-cts-v-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":163523117,"fileName":"2016-cadillac-cts-v-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-22T13:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-cadillac-cts-v-promo","title":"2016 Cadillac Cts V Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/163523117/2016-cadillac-cts-v-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":163523117,"fileName":"2016-cadillac-cts-v-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-22T13:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-cadillac-cts-v-header","title":"2016 Cadillac Cts V Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/163523114/2016-cadillac-cts-v-header.jpg","fileMasterId":163523114,"fileName":"2016-cadillac-cts-v-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":982489,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, rear-wheel-drive luxury sport sedan<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $85,990 (prices include destination charge and $1,000 gas guzzler tax)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $91,690<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Supercharged 6.2-liter V-8, 640 horsepower, 630 pound-feet of torque<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Eight-speed automatic transmission with launch control, performance algorithm shifting, and paddle shifters<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 14 mpg city/21 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Vehicle-Detail?vehicleId=10293\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">5/5 stars</a>; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: <a href=\"http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/cadillac/cts-4-door-sedan\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Good</a> in four categories, Marginal in small overlap front test <br>\n<strong>Competition</strong> (all prices include destination charges):<br>\n2016 Audi S6 $76,225<br>\n2015 BMW M5 $99,595<br>\n2015 Mercedes-AMG E63S Sedan $102,625<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:  9</strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2016 Cadillac Cts V 16","caption":"","fileMasterId":163523219,"fileName":"2016-cadillac-cts-v-16.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/163523219/2016-cadillac-cts-v-16.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>The 2016 Cadillac CTS-V has finally done what no American luxury car has been able to do since,</strong> well, since Cadillac did it once before, back when the Earth’s crust was cooling.

Hearing Robert Plant shriek “been a long time” gave me goosebumps and made my hair stand on end. And I wasn’t the only one. That ad ramped up Cadillac sales 16 percent that year.

To signal the change, the tachometer display went from black to white. In Sport, the CTS-V was much more comfortable in its own skin.

European cars have not only inspired Cadillac to achieve performance greatness; they have inspired well-heeled people who love performance to aspire to European standards of low-key taste and style and to eschew showiness. Alcantara and suede, muted colors, and perforated leather are the standard of luxury these days, and the CTS-V has all of that. But from the driver’s seat, the view is anti-Germanic: shiny and celebratory in a way that is also distinctly American, all piano black and brightly colored dials splashed across the Cadillac’s dashboard. You might call it vulgar in a nice way, proudly stating its Americanness in a way that many people won’t like.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"The CTS-V I tested had the optional Recaro high-performance seats ($2,300). If you’re going to use the launch control—the ultimate boy-racer thrill, which allows you maximum acceleration from a dead stop while managing wheel spin—you might as well spring for the seats. Another racing-oriented option is the Performance Data Recorder ($1,300), which measures your awesome track times.

The problem with it is information overload, with so many choices presented that take your eyes off the road. You can ameliorate the situation by reconfiguring the dashboard screen in front of your face to bring in some of the touchscreen functions. Another good thing is Cadillac’s exceptional voice recognition system, which removed a lot of my Cue angst by allowing me to direct most of the things I wanted to happen by just telling it to do so. By the way, the system is redeemed by offering the absolute best voice-activated navigation system on the market—something that you can also find on more affordable GM products, like the 2016 Chevy Impala.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"One extra-cost item I am in favor of is the Red Obsession Tintcoat for an additional $500.

These should all should be standard, in my humble opinion, given the $85,990 price of the car before options. To be fair, the CTS-V is massively loaded, but why the $1,600 squeeze?

That is a testament to the popularity of the Miata, which the Guinness record book recognizes as the bestselling two-seat roadster in the world. \n<br><br>\nThe Miata is not packed with amenities, nor is it particularly powerful. There is one rather modest engine available, a 2.0-liter four-cylinder. That engine produces 158 horsepower when mated to the six-speed automatic transmission and 167 horsepower with the manual. Fuel economy is not great, the cabin can be a tight fit, and there is almost no room in the trunk, but practicality is not the point of this car. All you need to do to understand the Miata is point it down a curvy road and take it on a brisk drive. There are few cars on the market that deliver the kind of simple driving pleasure at which the Miata excels.\n<br><br>\nOpening the canvas soft top is a simple, one-handed affair—all you have to do is release the center latch and fold the top back behind the seats. There is also an available retractable hard top for the Club and Grand Touring models that can be raised or lowered in just twelve seconds.   \n<br><br>\nThe affordable Sport model delivers the same kind of driving pleasure as the uplevel trims, but you’ll have to sacrifice one gear in its standard manual transmission, as it gets a five-speed rather than the six-speed manual that comes with the Club and Grand Touring models. The Club gets sporty front and rear fascias, cruise control, a shock tower brace to increase front-end rigidity, and seventeen-inch wheels. The Grand Touring adds heated leather-trimmed seats and has an available premium package that gets you keyless entry and ignition, xenon headlights, and Bluetooth connectivity. But all those details are beside the point. No matter which Miata you drive, whether it has a manual or an automatic, a soft or hard top, in any trim level, once you hit the open road you’ll realize why this is the world’s favorite sports car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\n25th Anniversary edition, Sport model’s soft-top is now canvas rather than vinyl.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata interior","fileMasterId":115019501,"fileName":"mazda-mx5miata-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115019501/mazda-mx5miata-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata","fileMasterId":115019456,"fileName":"mazda-mx5miata-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115019456/mazda-mx5miata-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata","fileMasterId":115019495,"fileName":"mazda-mx5miata-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115019495/mazda-mx5miata-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":42127,"make":"Mazda","model":"Miata","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:39:14.751-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547954751 }} },{ "_id":687982,"title":"2015 Lincoln MKX","subTitle":"A luxurious SUV.","slug":"2015-lincoln-mkx","promoTitle":"2015 Lincoln MKX","promoTeaserSmall":"A luxurious SUV.","promoTeaser":"A luxurious SUV.","keywords":["2015 Lincoln MKX"],"metaTitle":"2015 Lincoln MKX","metaKeywords":["2015 Lincoln MKX; Lincoln; SUV; sport-utility; crossover; American"],"metaDescription":"A luxurious SUV.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Even the plug-in hybrid, equipped with a 3.0-liter V-6 paired with an electric motor, is no slug off the line, and things get down right ridiculous once you move into the AMG and Maybach models. This full-size sedan earns its massive price tag with full LED lighting inside and out, an active perfuming system that discreetly and subtly scents and ionizes the air, and an optional suspension system that scans the road ahead and adjusts for the optimal ride. The new generation S-Class has upped its tech game with semi-autonomous parking, night vision, pedestrian detection, pre-collision warning and preparation systems, and every other safety feature the luxury marque has in its bag of tricks. The Comand infotainment system requires some getting used to, but it’s made a tad easier to master with its new touchpad. It’s rare that passengers in the rear get the same consideration as those at the helm, but the S-class goes that extra mile and offers optional power-adjustable massaging, heated, and ventilated rear outboard seats with memory, footrests—power adjustable for the right rear passenger—and a refrigerated compartment hidden in the center seat back.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News.

This is not to say that the S80 is boring, exactly, but it does favor comfort and smoothness over horsepower and performance. Its compliant suspension softens the impact of potholes and rough roads, and its seats are among the most comfortable and most supportive in the business. \r\n<br><br>\r\nBecause it’s a Volvo, safety is a top priority for the S80. City Safety, a crash avoidance system that automatically brakes the car to avoid or mitigate a collision at speeds of less than 31 mph, is standard, as are air bags all around and active front head restraints. Optional safety equipment include blind-spot monitoring, pedestrian and cyclist detection, lane-departure warning, and driver alert control, which detects erratic driving and brings it to the driver’s attention.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDespite its emphasis on comfort and safety, the S80 has a couple of very capable powertrains. New this year is the T5 Drive-E, a front-wheel-drive model that is powered by a 240-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The T6 model gets a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six that makes 300 horsepower and comes with a six-speed automatic. The T6 also has all-wheel drive, which comes in handy when the snow flies. The T6 can also be ordered with optional 19-inch wheels and a sport-tuned chassis that sharpens the handling somewhat.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPractical and user-friendly describe the interior.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Safety","id":1034779,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/car-safety","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-04T11:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pupsaver-promolarge","title":"Pupsaver Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/141222137/pupsaver-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":141222137,"fileName":"pupsaver-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-04T11:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pupsaver-promolarge","title":"Pupsaver Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/141222137/pupsaver-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":141222137,"fileName":"pupsaver-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-04T11:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pupsaver-header","title":"Pupsaver Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/141222134/pupsaver-header.jpg","fileMasterId":141222134,"fileName":"pupsaver-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":962483,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3><a href=\"http://www.pupsaver.com/howtobuy.php\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pupsaver</a><br>\n $139.95</h3>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>My fourteen-pound Jack Russell terrier, Bizee, raised her paw to be the tester of this rear-facing car seat for small dogs from Pupsaver.</strong> She has traveled many miles inside of her less-than-luxurious dog cage.

This one, which goes on sale in spring 2016, is all new for American buyers but is sold in Europe as the Opel Cascada. This model was greeted with approval at its debut at the 2015 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Built on the same platform as Buick's Verano compact sedan, the Cascada is billed as large enough to fit four adults, with 13.4 cubic feet of storage space with the top up. As for the top, it's a folding electrohydraulic soft top that retracts in seventeen seconds at speeds up to 31 mph. Luxury features are many, including General Motors' increasingly ubiquitous 4G LTE wireless hot spot on board, a 7.0-inch touchscreen with GM's excellent IntelliLink infotainment system, 20-inch wheels, and heated front seats and steering wheel, all standard. Active safety features include lane departure warning, park assist, rain-sensing wipers, and a rearview camera. Buick may be scratching an itch for a reasonably priced, reasonably luxurious convertible with this new model.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>New for 2016:</strong> The Cascada is all new for 2016.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Buick Cascada","fileMasterId":146349074,"fileName":"buick-cascada-2016-4.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146349074/buick-cascada-2016-4.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Buick Cascada","fileMasterId":146349077,"fileName":"buick-cascada-2016-header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146349077/buick-cascada-2016-header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Buick Cascada","fileMasterId":146349125,"fileName":"buick-cascada-2016-5.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146349125/buick-cascada-2016-5.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Buick Cascada","fileMasterId":146349122,"fileName":"buick-cascada-2016-3.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146349122/buick-cascada-2016-3.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Buick Cascada","fileMasterId":146349068,"fileName":"buick-cascada-2016-2.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146349068/buick-cascada-2016-2.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Buick Cascada","fileMasterId":146349065,"fileName":"buick-cascada-2016-1.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146349065/buick-cascada-2016-1.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":44358,"make":"Buick","model":"Cascada","year":2016},{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":true,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:39:59.263-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547999264 }} },{ "_id":698018,"title":"2016 BMW X3","subTitle":"The compact crossover with all the style and flair of a BMW.","slug":"2016-bmw-x3","promoTitle":"2016 BMW X3","promoTeaserSmall":"The compact crossover with all the style and flair of a BMW.","promoTeaser":"The compact crossover with all the style and flair of a BMW.","keywords":["2016 BMW X3"],"metaTitle":"2016 BMW X3 -

There are three engine choices, all connected to an eight-speed automatic transmission. You can stay connected in the X3 with enhanced USB and Bluetooth and Harman Kardon surround system, all of which come standard. You’ll have to shell out extra cash for the Driver Assistance Plus and Dynamic Handling packages, but on the bright side BMW has made some features like Smartphone integration and navigation systems less expensive. Whether you’re tossing groceries and kids in the backseat or folding down the backbench to make room for your latest furniture purchase, you can expect ease and comfort (and a few envious looks from other drivers).","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>New for 2016:</strong> Less expensive navigation system and smartphone integration<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"BMW X3 xDrive20d","fileMasterId":147598691,"fileName":"bmw-x3-xDrive20d-8.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/147598691/bmw-x3-xDrive20d-8.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"BMW X3 xDrive20d","fileMasterId":147598745,"fileName":"bmw-x3-xDrive20d-header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/147598745/bmw-x3-xDrive20d-header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"BMW X3 xDrive20d","fileMasterId":147598775,"fileName":"bmw-x3-xDrive20d-6.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/147598775/bmw-x3-xDrive20d-6.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"BMW X3 xDrive20d","fileMasterId":147598778,"fileName":"bmw-x3-xDrive20d-7.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/147598778/bmw-x3-xDrive20d-7.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"BMW X3 xDrive20d","fileMasterId":147598655,"fileName":"bmw-x3-xDrive20d-5.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/147598655/bmw-x3-xDrive20d-5.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"BMW X3 xDrive20d","fileMasterId":147598553,"fileName":"bmw-x3-xDrive20d-4.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/147598553/bmw-x3-xDrive20d-4.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"BMW X3 xDrive20d","fileMasterId":147598784,"fileName":"bmw-x3-xDrive20d.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/147598784/bmw-x3-xDrive20d.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"BMW X3 xDrive20d","fileMasterId":147598751,"fileName":"bmw-x3-xDrive20d-3.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/147598751/bmw-x3-xDrive20d-3.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"BMW X3 xDrive20d","fileMasterId":147598643,"fileName":"bmw-x3-xDrive20d-2.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/147598643/bmw-x3-xDrive20d-2.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":8,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":46776,"make":"BMW","model":"X3","year":2016},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":true,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:40:00.033-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456548000034 }} },{ "_id":699924,"title":"2016 Chrysler 200S AWD","subTitle":"Nice enough car, but the secret sauce—all-wheel drive—is the real reason to put this on your list.","slug":"2016-chrysler-200s-awd","promoTitle":"2016 Chrysler 200S AWD","promoTeaserSmall":"Nice enough car, but the secret sauce—all-wheel drive—is the real reason to put this on your list.","promoTeaser":"Nice enough car, but the secret sauce—all-wheel drive—is the real reason to put this on your list.","keywords":["2016 Chrysler 200S AWD"],"metaTitle":"2016 Chrysler 200S AWD -

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-12T09:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chrysler-200-homepage2","title":"Chrysler 200 Homepage2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/152351195/chrysler-200-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":152351195,"fileName":"chrysler-200-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-12T09:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chrysler-200-homepage2","title":"Chrysler 200 Homepage2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/152351195/chrysler-200-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":152351195,"fileName":"chrysler-200-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-12T09:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chrysler-200-header2","title":"Chrysler 200 Header2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/152351048/chrysler-200-header2.jpg","fileMasterId":152351048,"fileName":"chrysler-200-header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":968868,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, all-wheel-drive compact sedan<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> Front-wheel drive: LX, Limited S, C; All-wheel drive: S, C <br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $30,540 (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $33,525<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.6-liter V-6, 295 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Nine-speed automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 18 mpg city/29 mpg highway <br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: 5/5 stars; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: Top Safety Pick Plus (2015)<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Park View rearview camera<br>\n<strong>Options I can’t live without:</strong> Heated front seats and steering wheel; Uconnect Access on-board Wi-Fi hot spot<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Sport suspension, ambient LED lighting, tilting and telescoping steering wheel, leather-wrapped steering wheel, LED taillamps<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Navigation and Sound group ($1,495) includes 8.4-inch infotainment touchscreen, navigation, SiriusXM Traffic, Harman HD radio, 7.0-inch driver information screen, Alpine 506-watt amplifer, Uconnect Wi-Fi hot spot; Comfort group ($895) includes heated front seats and steering wheel, remote start<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering</strong> (prices include destination charge): <br>\n2016 Ford Fusion SE AWD ($29,345)<br>\n2016 Subaru Legacy 3.6R ($29,945)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Chrysler 200 13","caption":"","fileMasterId":152324402,"fileName":"chrysler-200-13.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/152324402/chrysler-200-13.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1302},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2047}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Shopping for a new car can be fun, but it can also be overwhelming.</strong> There are far more possible choices in the mid-size sedan category than you will ever have the patience to test drive—or even fully research.

Fold down the rear seats—both lie flat or do a 60/40 split—and the hatch can swallow more than 47 cubic feet of gear. And there is plenty of tech in this little car, too: Bluetooth, music streaming through Pandora or Stitcher SmartRadio, Satellite radio, and more. It’s pretty cute, too with a playfully aggressive exterior that can be painted in mild to wild colors. The interior can be outfitted in equally interesting colors and has smart details like contrast seat stitching and racy gauges. This is a small car you can enjoy both driving and looking at.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Chevrolet Sonic hatchback.","fileMasterId":95426335,"fileName":"2016-chevrolet-sonic-hatchback-3.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95426335/2016-chevrolet-sonic-hatchback-3.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Chevrolet Sonic hatchback.","fileMasterId":95426332,"fileName":"2016-chevrolet-sonic-hatchback-2.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95426332/2016-chevrolet-sonic-hatchback-2.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Chevrolet Sonic hatchback.","fileMasterId":95426323,"fileName":"2016-chevrolet-sonic-hatchback-header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95426323/2016-chevrolet-sonic-hatchback-header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Chevrolet Sonic sedan.","fileMasterId":95426341,"fileName":"2016-chevrolet-sonic-sedan-5.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95426341/2016-chevrolet-sonic-sedan-5.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Chevrolet Sonic.","fileMasterId":95426344,"fileName":"2016-chevrolet-sonic-4.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95426344/2016-chevrolet-sonic-4.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":2,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>New in 2016</h3>\nThree new metallic shades: Nightfall Gray, Kinetic Blue, and Mosaic Black<br>\nChevrolet MyLink standard on LT <br>\nAutomatic transmission standard on LTZ <br>","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":48449,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Sonic","year":2016},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"71d39f07-0bc5-39bd-9468-12085dc13b7c","type":"mediaTag","name":"First_Car","path":"/Main/First_Car"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":true,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:40:20.280-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456548020280 }} },{ "_id":705563,"title":"2017 Ford Escape","subTitle":"Check out the safety and connectivity added to the menu for the new generation of Ford's compact crossover.","slug":"2017-ford-escape","promoTitle":"2017 Ford Escape","promoTeaserSmall":"Check out the safety and connectivity added to the menu for the new generation of Ford's compact crossover.","promoTeaser":"Check out the safety and connectivity added to the menu for the new generation of Ford's compact crossover.","keywords":["2017 Ford Escape -

Ahrens","firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Ahrens","jobTitle":"Contributing Writer","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"When <em>Automobile</em> launched in 1986, my byline appeared on a sidebar to the cover story written by our founding editor David E. Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-07T08:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-hyundai-veloster-homepage","title":"2016 Hyundai Veloster Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96704026/2016-hyundai-veloster-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":96704026,"fileName":"2016-hyundai-veloster-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-07T08:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-hyundai-veloster-homepage","title":"2016 Hyundai Veloster Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96704026/2016-hyundai-veloster-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":96704026,"fileName":"2016-hyundai-veloster-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-07T08:26:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-hyundai-veloster-3","title":"2016 Hyundai Veloster 3","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96703558/2016-hyundai-veloster-3.jpg","fileMasterId":96703558,"fileName":"2016-hyundai-veloster-3.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":980278,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2016 Hyundai Veloster Rally Edition</h3>\n<strong>Type:</strong> Four-passenger, three-door front-wheel-drive sport coupe<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> Veloster, Turbo, Turbo R-Spec, Rally Edition<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $24,775 (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $24,920<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder, 201 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed manual with B&M Racing sport shifter<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 25 mpg city/33 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: 5/5 stars http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Vehicle-Detail?vehicleId=10016; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: Not yet rated<br>\n<strong>Competition</strong> (all prices include destination charges):<br>\n2016 Ford Fiesta ST ($21,845)<br>\n2016 Kia Soul !

That’s when it all came together for me and the Veloster finally got my attention. Once I started doing hot laps, I drew the attention of the then head of Hyundai, a man who had no confidence dilemma (nor do I), who was very competitive (as am I). He inserted himself into the group of journalists waiting their turns trackside, no doubt planning on showing me his stuff.

Hyundai told me that it’s still recommended to wash the car by hand, using a specialized matte-finish care kit, to maintain the matteness of the matte-finish paint.

It’s a little fireball, and it’s extra nice when merging into the freeway madness or passing. That’s the beauty of a turbo. There’s a smooth but noticeable power boost when the turbocharger winds up and kicks in.

Use your car’s technology to help you, not take over for you.</strong> We are big fans of active safety technology—things like blind spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert. If you’re lucky enough to have one of the growing number of new cars with adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability, you’re in luck next time you hit a traffic slowdown. This technology uses radar sensors to watch the road ahead of you and will adjust your car’s speed automatically in line with what the traffic ahead is doing, often at speeds all the way down to 0 mph, saving your right leg from that constant dance between the brake and the accelerator.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

And speaking of impressive numbers, how about 200 horsepower, 200 miles on a charge, 0 to 60 mph in under seven seconds?

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-14T11:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"naias-promo","title":"Naias Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/168480536/naias-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":168480536,"fileName":"naias-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-14T11:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"naias-promo","title":"Naias Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/168480536/naias-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":168480536,"fileName":"naias-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-14T11:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"naias-header","title":"Naias Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98279467/naias-header.jpg","fileMasterId":98279467,"fileName":"naias-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":986051,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Every year, Detroit’s auto show is an eagerly anticipated bright spot in the grayness of Michigan in January.</strong> This year’s media preview was a tiny bit less glittery in that several luxury brands—Bentley, Jaguar Land Rover, Maserati, Rolls-Royce, and Tesla—chose not to participate.

This year, it's the drop-dead gorgeous Avista two-plus-two sport coupe that captured all the attention, with its sexy sheetmetal shown to perfect advantage by a startling deep blue paint job. The Avista concept shows off some of the luxury features a Buick might be expected to carry, such as ionic air purifiers, aromatherapy, and noise cancellation technology. The swoopy center console has \"a future vision\" of the already good IntelliLink infotainment system with a wide screen and touch controls.The door and seat trim have 3D-printed elements. The powertrain also features cylinder deactivation and stop/start technology to save fuel.

It was still important for General Motors chairman Mary Barra to appear in Detroit and introduce the electric car, which is tipped to sell for about $37,000, reduced to around $30,000 after federal subsidies. And speaking of impressive numbers, how about 200 horsepower, 200 miles on a charge, 0 to 60 mph in under seven seconds? (A full charge will take nine hours using the standard on-board charger and a 240-volt outlet, while you can charge enough to get 90 miles of range in a half-hour, Barra said.) The styling is that of a compact (very compact) crossover, featuring SUV-style tall seating positions. Because the battery pack is flat and mounted under the floor, there's 94 cubic feet of passenger room. That's roughly the same as the Honda Fit, a car often praised for its roominess inside. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are on board, as is a 10.2-inch touchscreen infotainment system. Among the available features are a bird's-eye surround-view camera and a wide-angle rearview mirror camera, other features that put us in mind of the Honda Fit.

We never agreed with people who made fun of “family haulers,” and this well-thought-out Pacifica shows that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has as much respect for the family-car shopper as we do. The 3.6-liter V-6 engine makes 287 horsepower and is teamed with a nine-speed automatic transmission, yielding 28 mpg on the highway. A hybrid version comes out in the summer, promising 80 MPGe and 30 miles of range on electric power alone—not bad for a vehicle that seats eight. The pair of ten-inch fold-down screens, with Wi-Fi, will keep back-seat passengers happy, complete with a child-friendly “Are We There Yet?” navigation app. Just kick your foot under either rear sliding door or the back liftgate, and it will open for you, hands-free.

The engine is a 3.5-liter V-6 that should make around the same 280 horsepower as in the Honda Pilot SUV. If you think the front half of the Ridgeline looks a lot like the new Pilot, that's because they are built on the same platform and share a lot of parts; in fact, they will be built at the same Alabama plant. Honda is known for innovative packaging, and the Ridgeline is no exception: there’s a locking in-bed trunk, something only Honda has, plus an in-bed audio system.

An optional Revel audio system (we tried it) makes the Continental into one of the world’s finest concert halls.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-02-22T08:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"jean-and-malibu","title":"Jean And Malibu","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98970174/Jean-and-Malibu.JPG","fileMasterId":98970174,"fileName":"Jean-and-Malibu.JPG","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-02-22T08:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"jean-and-malibu","title":"Jean And Malibu","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98970174/Jean-and-Malibu.JPG","fileMasterId":98970174,"fileName":"Jean-and-Malibu.JPG","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-02-22T08:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-malibu","title":"2016 Malibu","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98969262/2016-Malibu.JPG","fileMasterId":98969262,"fileName":"2016-Malibu.JPG","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":989523,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"If it hadn't suddenly started snowing for real long about late January like it was <em>finally</em> winter, covering our rural surroundings with a puffy cold, white blanket of pain-in-the-ass, I might not have noticed that the test cars visiting Jean’s Driveway were all red.
