Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-28T07:32:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"homepage","title":"weekly windup 2 28","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62950121/homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62950121,"fileName":"homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":316},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-28T07:32:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"homepage","title":"weekly windup 2 28","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62950121/homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62950121,"fileName":"homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":316},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-28T07:32:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"header","title":"weekly windup 2 28","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62949983/header.jpg","fileMasterId":62949983,"fileName":"header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-28T07:32:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"homepage","title":"weekly windup 2 28","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62950121/homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62950121,"fileName":"homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":316},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}}},"pages":[{"id":637543,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>1.</strong> <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em> drops the F bomb more than 500 times. <a href=\"http://laughingsquid.com/car-salesman-goes-on-hilarious-foul-mouthed-rant-during-live-tv-broadcast-of-a-commercial-in-1969/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">This video</a> only drops it three times, but it really grabbed my attention.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>2.</strong> If you are a fan of gullwings and suicide doors, you will love<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAtkoje4-eM\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> the disappearing door</a>.

Over that quarter-century, I went on to write general assignment stories for the <em>Milwaukee Sentinel</em>, became a cop reporter, then schools reporter and film critic for the <em>Quad-City Times</em>, where I also covered Cary Grant’s death in Davenport, Iowa, and then I worked for the <em>San Diego Business Journal</em>, where I became an expert on the arcane America’s Cup Deed of Gift. When I moved to Washington, D.C., where I wrote about the Clinton health care reform plan and other Capitol Hill issues for an inside-the-beltway newsletter publisher, I thought I had found my true calling. Matt DeLorenzo convinced me otherwise, and I moved to Detroit in 1996 to work for <em>AutoWeek</em>. Four years later, Jack Keebler lured me to <em>Motor Trend</em>, where I wrote news and rumors about future cars, voted in a dozen (each) Car of the Year and Sport/Utility of the Year competitions, and blogged as the Motor City Blogman. Detroit is to the global auto industry what Washington is to national politics. It’s easily more fascinating and as frustrating to cover as a journalist. The commute is far more interesting. \n<br><br>\nMy years at <em>Motor Trend</em>, working side-by-side with Technical Director Frank Markus, have been enormously fulfilling. I’ve become fully immersed in the nuts and bolts of cars, and the industry. You have to keep a love for cars and driving in perspective. For me, Donna, our two collies, and my family back in Wisconsin come first. I can be nearly as passionate about politics, movies and art, and the Green Bay Packers, of which I’m a shareholder. My favorite sport is still Formula 1, though.\n<br><br>\n<em>Automobile</em> is about living with cars, both the good ones and the bad ones, but most importantly, the most interesting ones. With autonomous cars on the near horizon, we face the greatest threat to our enthusiasm since the malaise and oil embargoes of the ‘70s, the era when I earned my driver’s license. With Jean, Joe and their crew, <em>Automobile</em> already has the best, most interesting writers to explain why you should put down that mobile phone and grab the steering wheel. I’m thrilled to become part of this team and I look forward to helping place the cars and the way we drive them in context.","fileMasterId":67554677,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67554677/67554677.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2031,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"todd.lassa@automobilemag.com"},{"id":2032,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/am_lassa"}],"websiteIds":[3002,3006,10009,40064,6202044,6202059,6202060,6202077,6202083,6202085,6202090]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-05T09:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"geneva-homepage","title":"report from geneva","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67606657/geneva-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67606657,"fileName":"geneva-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-05T09:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"geneva-homepage","title":"report from geneva","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67606657/geneva-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67606657,"fileName":"geneva-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-05T09:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"geneva-header","title":"report from geneva","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69237702/geneva-header.jpg","fileMasterId":69237702,"fileName":"geneva-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-05T09:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"geneva-homepage","title":"report from geneva","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67606657/geneva-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67606657,"fileName":"geneva-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":637977,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"From the land of Swiss army knives and overpriced watches comes the 84th International Salon de l’Auto, every car fan's favorite show.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Over that quarter-century, I went on to write general assignment stories for the <em>Milwaukee Sentinel</em>, became a cop reporter, then schools reporter and film critic for the <em>Quad-City Times</em>, where I also covered Cary Grant’s death in Davenport, Iowa, and then I worked for the <em>San Diego Business Journal</em>, where I became an expert on the arcane America’s Cup Deed of Gift. When I moved to Washington, D.C., where I wrote about the Clinton health care reform plan and other Capitol Hill issues for an inside-the-beltway newsletter publisher, I thought I had found my true calling. Matt DeLorenzo convinced me otherwise, and I moved to Detroit in 1996 to work for <em>AutoWeek</em>. Four years later, Jack Keebler lured me to <em>Motor Trend</em>, where I wrote news and rumors about future cars, voted in a dozen (each) Car of the Year and Sport/Utility of the Year competitions, and blogged as the Motor City Blogman. Detroit is to the global auto industry what Washington is to national politics. It’s easily more fascinating and as frustrating to cover as a journalist. The commute is far more interesting. \n<br><br>\nMy years at <em>Motor Trend</em>, working side-by-side with Technical Director Frank Markus, have been enormously fulfilling. I’ve become fully immersed in the nuts and bolts of cars, and the industry. You have to keep a love for cars and driving in perspective. For me, Donna, our two collies, and my family back in Wisconsin come first. I can be nearly as passionate about politics, movies and art, and the Green Bay Packers, of which I’m a shareholder. My favorite sport is still Formula 1, though.\n<br><br>\n<em>Automobile</em> is about living with cars, both the good ones and the bad ones, but most importantly, the most interesting ones. With autonomous cars on the near horizon, we face the greatest threat to our enthusiasm since the malaise and oil embargoes of the ‘70s, the era when I earned my driver’s license. With Jean, Joe and their crew, <em>Automobile</em> already has the best, most interesting writers to explain why you should put down that mobile phone and grab the steering wheel. I’m thrilled to become part of this team and I look forward to helping place the cars and the way we drive them in context.","fileMasterId":67554677,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67554677/67554677.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2031,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"todd.lassa@automobilemag.com"},{"id":2032,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/am_lassa"}],"websiteIds":[3002,3006,10009,40064,6202044,6202059,6202060,6202077,6202083,6202085,6202090]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-27T21:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"dog-aid-homepage2","title":"nissan loves detroit dogs","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68939686/dog-aid-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":68939686,"fileName":"dog-aid-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-27T21:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"dog-aid-homepage2","title":"nissan loves detroit dogs","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68939686/dog-aid-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":68939686,"fileName":"dog-aid-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-27T21:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"dog-aid-header2","title":"nissan loves detroit dogs","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70800588/dog-aid-header2.jpg","fileMasterId":70800588,"fileName":"dog-aid-header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-27T21:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"dog-aid-homepage2","title":"nissan loves detroit dogs","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68939686/dog-aid-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":68939686,"fileName":"dog-aid-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":641023,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"You may remember “Mister K” and his “dogs love trucks” commercials for the Nissan Frontier pickup some sixteen years ago.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-18T04:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gmc-terrain-homepage","title":"2014 gmc terrain denali awd","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69685819/gmc-terrain-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69685819,"fileName":"gmc-terrain-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-18T04:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gmc-terrain-homepage","title":"2014 gmc terrain denali awd","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69685819/gmc-terrain-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69685819,"fileName":"gmc-terrain-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-18T04:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gmc-terrain-header","title":"2014 gmc terrain denali awd","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69685816/gmc-terrain-header.jpg","fileMasterId":69685816,"fileName":"gmc-terrain-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-18T04:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gmc-terrain-homepage","title":"2014 gmc terrain denali awd","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69685819/gmc-terrain-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69685819,"fileName":"gmc-terrain-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":666188,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"If you are in the market for a sport-utility vehicle, you've already noticed how many there are to choose from.

Am I worried that Big Brother is watching? Well, not really. I'm more interested in the idea that cars are becoming more than silent lumps of sheetmetal and are able to interact with each other in a modern way that will advance safety.

The Safety Pilot program was much talked about.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Here are some fun facts I learned:","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>1. It's huge.</h3> The Safety Pilot program started in late 2012 and enlisted 2,800 participants (including me) who have allowed UMTRI to install devices in their cars. Most, like mine, send and receive signals without doing anything you can see, hear, or detect from inside the car. A few are equipped to alert the driver about safety issues such as impending collisions or traffic issues. All the devices store data that researchers are using as a rich mine of information to help develop connected-vehicle technology.  From 2012 until now, these devices have collectively recorded 3.9 million trips or 24.6 million miles on the roads, and they've sent out 30 billion basic safety messages through the technology. And about 80 percent of the time when the participating cars are on the road, they've come into contact with another connected vehicle. Kind of amazing considering the small size of the participant group! But really, this whole thing is similar to, but more interesting than, the gathering of market data that Disney is looking for when it hands out those Magic Bands.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>2. It's diverse.</h3> Among the participants are six motorcycles, which ran up 4,676 connected miles from May to November last year. During that time, they encountered another connected pilot vehicle 4,376 times. They've collected useful data on kinematics and motorcyclist behavior that University of Michigan engineering students are analyzing as we speak.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"A participant about to hit the roads next week is a bicyclist. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<h3>3. It's growing.</h3> The project put out a call to grow the number of participating vehicles to 9,000. On the day an article appeared on the local Ann Arbor newspaper's website, 500 people called to volunteer. The next step is to expand the program from one part of Ann Arbor outward to all of southeastern Michigan, with a planned participant base of 20,000 vehicles.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<h3>4. It has a really important point.</h3> Mike Shulman of Ford is technical lead of the Crash Avoidance Metrics Partnership (CAMP), which is a consortium of several automakers working on connected-vehicle technology.  . \"If drivers are pretty good most of the time,\" he says, \"every once in a while, not so much, and when you aggregate over the whole population you see 32,000 fatalities.\" He notes that early estimates suggested vehicle-to-vehicle communication could help avoid 80 percent of crashes. That's a persuasive argument.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<h3>5. It's going to be complicated.</h3>\nUMTRI's Sayer says it's no good creating connected vehicles that become obsolete, noting that every device in the Safety Pilot program had to come in for at least one software update this year. \"We need something that drivers, passengers, and pedestrians are going to maintain,\" he said. <br>\n<br>\nAutomakers, through the CAMP consortium and other efforts, are working together on setting standards, test procedures, and safety requirements. Such things as retrofitting existing vehicles or selling the connected technology as an aftermarket product? That's all still up in the air. So is figuring out how the devices would be maintained and updated.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"<h3>6. It's going to be expensive to set up.</h3> Shulman commented: \"We can demonstrate a bunch of operations, but the infrastructure guys are really broke, and they've got to be convinced this is a good thing to invest their money in. Is Montana going to do this? We need the data that enables people to make those investment decisions.\"<br>\n<br>\nNHTSA is looking at the cost over a forty-year time horizon. That's some amortization table. Does the benefit outweigh the cost?

The electronics can also vary the power delivery between the left- and right-side wheels to improve handling. Electronics can also decide when to engage based on the detection of wheel slip by a single tire. These days, AWD has become available as an option in mid- and full-size luxury cars to enhance all-weather mobility in places where the winters are hard. AWD systems are not as heavy as they once were; nor do they represent lots of momentum-sapping friction. Even so, there is usually a slight compromise in fuel economy that comes with AWD.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-21T12:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford-mustang-50-years-las-vegas-event-motor-speedway-lot","title":"Ford Mustang 50 Years Las Vegas Event","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73093722/Ford-Mustang-50-Years-Las-Vegas-event-Motor-Speedway-lot.jpg","fileMasterId":73093722,"fileName":"Ford-Mustang-50-Years-Las-Vegas-event-Motor-Speedway-lot.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1360},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2048}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-21T12:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford-mustang-50-years-las-vegas-event-motor-speedway-lot","title":"Ford Mustang 50 Years Las Vegas Event","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73093722/Ford-Mustang-50-Years-Las-Vegas-event-Motor-Speedway-lot.jpg","fileMasterId":73093722,"fileName":"Ford-Mustang-50-Years-Las-Vegas-event-Motor-Speedway-lot.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1360},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2048}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-21T12:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford-mustang-50-years-las-vegas-event-motor-speedway-lot","title":"Ford Mustang 50 Years Las Vegas Event","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73093722/Ford-Mustang-50-Years-Las-Vegas-event-Motor-Speedway-lot.jpg","fileMasterId":73093722,"fileName":"Ford-Mustang-50-Years-Las-Vegas-event-Motor-Speedway-lot.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1360},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2048}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-21T12:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford-mustang-50-years-las-vegas-event-motor-speedway-lot","title":"Ford Mustang 50 Years Las Vegas Event","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73093722/Ford-Mustang-50-Years-Las-Vegas-event-Motor-Speedway-lot.jpg","fileMasterId":73093722,"fileName":"Ford-Mustang-50-Years-Las-Vegas-event-Motor-Speedway-lot.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1360},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2048}}},"pages":[{"id":666787,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<em>Photography by Ronald Ahrens.<br>\nThis article originally appeared on the website of <a href=\"http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/1404-50-years-of-ford-mustangs/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Automobile Magazine.</a></em><br>\n<br>\nEven without the plangent wailing of V-8 engines on the Las Vegas boulevards, we would have known the Mustang Club of America was in town on <strong><a href=\"http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/1404-on-this-day-ford-mustang-debut/\" title=\"\">Thursday, April 17</a></strong>, as members celebrated the <strong><a href=\"http://www.automobilemag.com/auto_shows/new_york/2014/1404-2015-ford-mustang-50-year-limited-edition/\" title=\"\">50th anniversary</a></strong> of their favorite car.

We even encountered nine members of the Mustang Club of Aruba, who spoke their native Papiamento patois.

The sewn pleats in the seat cushions were another surprise-and-delight feature. “The trim in the car would be considered out of the question for even our highest-priced Impala.” The ’68 coupe pictured here still has the lithe body, but with twin 750-cfm four-barrels, a supercharger, and nitrous, it’s a street machine in need of some fat Hoosier tires at the rear.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"\r\nThanks to Knudsen, who became Ford Motor Company president in 1968, the Mustang got pumped up and began to swagger.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T11:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-civic-homepage","title":"2014 honda civic ex l","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73725978/honda-civic-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":73725978,"fileName":"honda-civic-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T11:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-civic-homepage","title":"2014 honda civic ex l","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73725978/honda-civic-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":73725978,"fileName":"honda-civic-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T11:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-civic-header","title":"2014 honda civic ex l","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66760589/honda-civic-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66760589,"fileName":"honda-civic-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T11:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-civic-homepage","title":"2014 honda civic ex l","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73725978/honda-civic-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":73725978,"fileName":"honda-civic-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":667239,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Price:</strong> $25,030 (base price), $25,030 as tested (including destination charge) <br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 1.8-liter four-cylinder, 143 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Continuously variable automatic (CVT)<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 30 mpg city/39 mpg highway <br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> LaneWatch<br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Remote start ($399)<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> HondaLink Next Generation infotainment system, LaneWatch, Bluetooth hands-free link, SiriusXM satellite radio, USB audio interface<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> None<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong>  Ford Focus, Mazda 3, Toyota Corolla, Volkswagen Jetta<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2014 honda civic ex l","caption":"","fileMasterId":66760280,"fileName":"honda-civic-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66760280/honda-civic-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":1,"text":"I drove the 2014 Honda Civic EX-L Navi on a short road trip to a dance competition for my seventeen-year-old daughter.

Honda’s willingness to keep tweaking it to match their customers' demands proves that it intends to hold on to this lofty position.

It is good as a commuter, a city car, or a  cross-country tourer—but the back seat is best left to smaller travelers or additional cargo space for longer hauls. It is a great car for young drivers, too, thanks to its safety features like LaneWatch, and the connectivity will appeal to that audience as well.

As for Lane Watch, when you arrive at an intersection and put on your right turn signal, it comes on automatically to show you a back view from a camera in the passenger's-side mirror.

Subsequently he has published thousands of articles on cars and airplanes, in American, Asian, English, European, and South American magazines. He contributed to several books, including the entire text of the well-reviewed <em>Auto Legends</em>, now available in five translated editions -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Polish in addition to the original English version. In 1985, <em>Automobile Magazine</em> founder David E. Davis, Jr., invited him to be one of two executive editors when <em>Automobile</em> was in the planning stages. Cumberford demurred, saying he knew nothing about magazine production and claims he still doesn’t, except that it’s important to meet deadlines. He contributed features from the beginning and began his popular “By Design” column in the sixth issue, September 1986.  \n<br><br>\nIn car design, Cumberford was even more a youthful prodigy. He sketched the body for the first car ever built to his designs when he was a fifteen-year-old Los Angeles high-school student. That car, the Parkinson Jaguar Special, is still active in historic racing sixty years after it was created. Hired directly by General Motors’ legendary Vice President of Design, Harley J. Earl, Cumberford became a professional car designer at nineteen. Leaving Detroit, he returned to California to attend UCLA to study philosophy. He rejoined the automotive world in the early 1960s and has continued to create new automotive shapes since then, always as an independent design consultant. He has lived and worked in six of the fifty United States and in France, Mexico, and Switzerland. The range of his design projects includes both racing and touring cars, trucks, aircraft, boats, hovercraft, and even ecological architecture. \n<br><br>\nHe is known worldwide for strong opinions but is well-respected in the design world because it is known that he is always completely honest in his views, with no agenda other than respect for good design and good designers. “There’s no ad hominem,” he says, “I judge the design, not the designers. There are designers I really like personally who’ve been credited with designs I heartily dislike -- for reasons I always state very clearly -- and designs I love done by people with whom I have absolutely no affinity. Except that we both like their work.”","fileMasterId":74354961,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74354961/74354961.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2022,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"rcumberford@gmail.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044,6202077]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T12:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"car-design-mag-homepage","title":"italian style magazine","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66764075/car-design-mag-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66764075,"fileName":"car-design-mag-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T12:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"car-design-mag-homepage","title":"italian style magazine","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66764075/car-design-mag-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66764075,"fileName":"car-design-mag-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T12:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"car-design-mag-header","title":"italian style magazine","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66764072/car-design-mag-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66764072,"fileName":"car-design-mag-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T12:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"car-design-mag-homepage","title":"italian style magazine","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66764075/car-design-mag-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66764075,"fileName":"car-design-mag-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":667402,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"italian style magazine","caption":"","fileMasterId":70391434,"fileName":"car-design-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70391434/car-design-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"“We can regret, lament, celebrate the past, but there is no foreseeable future for Italian car design.” I wrote that <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/soapbox/r-i-p-carrozzerie-italiane/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> last month, and by so doing brought down the wrath of a great many interested parties who desperately want to believe all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>But, as much as I’d like for them to be correct in their rose-colored views, they aren’t. The proof of that is pretty simple, as can be seen in the exodus of Fiat,</strong> the greatest Italian enterprise since the Roman Empire fell, from Italy to England, Holland, and Michigan… anything to get out of its home nation. That the move was financed by our own government’s jobs-saving gift of Chrysler to the Agnelli family just underlines the general hopelessness of Italy today. It will get better, of course, because Italians are great innovators and have been central to much of the world’s progress in art, science, and business, but it won’t happen soon.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"But there is a globally focused automotive activity in Italy that should be celebrated today: the creation thirty-five years ago of the finest publication dedicated to car design ever to exist, <em><a href=\"http://www.autodesignmagazine.com/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Auto & Design</a></em>. Fulvio Cinti, now in his nineties, who retired at the end of last year as editor and administrator of the publication he had imagined, conceived, and guided for decades, was for a long time the sports editor of <em>La Stampa,</em> one of Italy’s most important daily newspapers, based in Turin, as was Fiat in its glory years.  Sports writing in Italy includes motorsport, not just stick-and-ball activities as in U.S. newspapers, so Cinti knew the protagonists in the automotive world, and he knew about cars and racing.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"italian style magazine","caption":"","fileMasterId":73730019,"fileName":"car-design-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73730019/car-design-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>He also knew design and beauty and was on intimate terms with all the leading designers</strong> during the unforgettable period of 1945 to 1975, when Italian design absolutely led the world. He was on a first-name basis with Gianni Agnelli, Gianni Lancia, ‘Pinin’ Farina, ‘Nuccio’ Bertone, Giorgietto Giugiaro, Marcello Gandini, and hundreds of others throughout the world and could call on their support. <br>\n<br>\nCinti's first design publication,<em> Style Auto,</em> launched soon after his retirement from <em>La Stampa,</em> was really good. I found a sole copy in Manhattan long ago and cherish it to this day, but the problems of production and distribution and interfering collaborators put an end to it not long after it began. <br>\n<br>\nBut Cinti bided his time, and at the end of the Seventies, he was supported in launching <em>Auto & Design</em> by a group of friends, all movers and shakers in the upper levels of Italian industry and society. It was and is a sumptuous publication, thanks to its brilliant initial art director, the late Eros Sogno, with gorgeous layouts, generous white space, big pictures, and enormous amounts of inside information on the creation of key production and concept cars.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<strong>It was Jean Jennings who put me in touch with Cinti sometime in the Eighties.</strong> She had encountered him, I presume, at an auto show in Europe, and agreed to work with <em>Auto & Design,</em> but when <em>Automobile Magazine</em> began and I joined my old friend—and Jean’s mentor—David E. Davis, Jr., in the new adventure, she thought I might be a better fit for Cinti’s magazine. <br>\n<br>\nAnd so it turned out. Cinti and I communicate in less-than-classical French (on both sides), and we have found endless points of convergence and agreement, and some surprising connections. For instance, when the Lancia sports car racing team came to America sixty years ago for the 1954 Sebring 12 Hours race, the first time serious European racing drivers had visited our country since the Gordon Bennett races in the late Thirties, Cinti and I were both there.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"No, we didn’t meet. Cinti was then a man in full, handsome and dynamic, with important work at a major newspaper. I was a teenage student who’d dropped out of design school for lack of money, and I was only present in Florida because I and a couple of fellow students desperately wanted to see the cars. That one of my pals had a Volkswagen we could drive nonstop across the U.S., and that I lived in a converted garage in the back yard of the struggling owner of a small car magazine, <em>Road & Track,</em> who wanted coverage and was willing to print my handwritten story of the race—my first-ever publication—meant that we could be in the same place at the same time, but not meet as equals.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<strong>I will never forget the first time I met Fulvio Cinti. It was at the Turin Auto Show in 1988.</strong> He was affable and charming, but I was wary of him. Why? Because he was completely surrounded by a bevy of the most astonishingly beautiful young women. I say that now, but in fact they were really girls, one of them—certainly the most striking—no more than a teenager. She was statuesque, with long coal-black hair hanging well below her waist. In fact, it was cut off exactly at hem height of her (very) miniskirt. My reaction, based on previous experience in Italy, was that this Cinti was what we usually call “a dirty old man.” An extremely false impression based on irrelevant data, as it turned out.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Cinti’s admirable legacy, quite apart from the magnificence of <em>Auto & Design</em> itself, is to have broken completely with the cult of machismo all too rife in Italian business. Today, all employees of the magazine he founded are female, every one of them highly capable, most of them long serving. Maria Teresa Fausto (at left in the photo below), the supposed “top model” I’d met in the Eighties, is still at <em>Auto & Design</em> twenty-six years later, responsible for handling subscriptions, back issues, and online activities. Cinti’s successor as Amministratore Unico (C.E.O.), Laura Carpaneto, is new in the post, but she is an architect whose connection with the magazine goes back to the beginning. Her father, whose shares she inherited, was one of the founding investors. Giusi Consolaro, head of the administrative office, has been with the magazine since 1980, and I can attest to her competence.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Baruffaldi","caption":"","fileMasterId":67005113,"fileName":"Baruffaldi.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67005113/Baruffaldi.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":624}},"order":7,"text":"Elisabetta Massola, editorial assistant responsible for web and social media, joined the staff in 1985, and Silvia Baruffaldi (at right in this photo), now only the second-ever Direttore Responsabile (Editor in Chief), joined Cinti’s team two years later; her career was carefully developed with more and more responsibility added as her experience grew. Paola Sorbara, whose activities include schools and books, is a twenty-first-century addition, signing on in 2002. Marta Cinti, Fulvio’s actual granddaughter, has been contributing since 1999 and has been a full-time reporter and graphic designer for four years. <br>\n<br>\nIt’s not surprising when the whole staff of a fashion magazine is female, but for a field of interest as typically male-dominated as automobiles, this is a radical transformation, brought about by a man who overcame a strong cultural tradition of ignoring women’s abilities.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"As with other automotive publications, the subject matter—automobiles and design, as the title states so clearly—has traditionally been covered by men.

Setright from England was on the team until his death. Alberto Mallo of Spain, Serge Bellu in France, Luca Ciferri, Roberto Piatti, and many other Italians, all well known and highly respected in their own countries, have made valued contributions and will continue to do so, always because of Fulvio Cinti’s strong commitment to car design as a serious subject.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"\tBut a great part of his legacy will always remain his atypical willingness to acknowledge the abilities and value of intelligent women.

Kennedy’s Lincoln Continental limousine, the same one he was riding in when he was shot, and noticed it was fitted with a hard top, a feature added after the assassination.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-09T05:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mothersday-homepage","title":"Mothersday Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66791369/mothersday-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66791369,"fileName":"mothersday-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-09T05:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mothersday-header","title":"Mothersday Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66791372/mothersday-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66791372,"fileName":"mothersday-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-09T05:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mothersday-header","title":"Mothersday Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66791372/mothersday-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66791372,"fileName":"mothersday-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-09T05:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mothersday-homepage","title":"Mothersday Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66791369/mothersday-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66791369,"fileName":"mothersday-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":667976,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"If you're a mom out on the road this weekend, or if you're out in the car heading to see Mom, here's a playlist of songs to put you in the right frame of mind for the holiday.

As a child I would spend hours arranging toy cars in elaborate races on the living room floor, and once spent time on a vacation in France reading the owner's manual to my parents' Ford Mondeo. The first auto show I attended was in Birmingham; after moving to Michigan I began attending the Detroit auto show almost every year. I couldn't wait to take driver's ed., get my driver's license at age 16, and tirelessly polish my slightly rusty first car. <br><br>\n\nBy the time I entered the University of Michigan, I had decided I wanted to pursue journalism and began writing for the student paper. But I also had an internship at <em>Car and Driver</em>, and quickly realized that cars were the only thing I was truly interested in reporting on. After all, countless teachers and professors had passed on the wisdom that you should, \"Write what you know.\" I pursued that interest after graduation and managed to land a job at <em>Automobile Magazine</em>, just down the street from where I'd studied for the prior four years. <br><br>\n\nFast forward to today, and I've been fortunate enough to attend auto shows on three different continents. I've learned to drive sports cars like a Fiat 500 Abarth on a race track, and spent a week eking mileage out of a Nissan Leaf electric car. <br><br>\n\nAlthough I love driving new cars, one of my favorite parts of this job is having the opportunity to meet the people responsible for those cars. Whether it's the executives speaking at launches or engineers revealing tech secrets at auto shows, I love being able to get a feel for how things work behind the scenes. <br><br>\n\nThe most surprising part about this job is that I've become the de facto go-to for friends or family members who have questions or want advice about cars. Surprisingly enough, not everybody I talk to wants to buy a two-seat sports car.","fileMasterId":67554743,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67554743/67554743.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2039,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/AM_Jake"},{"id":2040,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jake.holmes@sorc.com"},{"id":2041,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/u/0/102704652534529580048/"}],"websiteIds":[3002,3005,3006,10009,40064,6202044,6202059,6202060,6202073,6202075,6202076,6202077,6202079,6202082,6202083,6202085,6202090,6202094]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T10:28:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"beaulieu-national-motor-museum-line-of-toy-cars-1","title":"Beaulieu National Motor Museum","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70385113/Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","fileMasterId":70385113,"fileName":"Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1360},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2048}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T10:28:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"beaulieu-national-motor-museum-line-of-toy-cars-1","title":"Beaulieu National Motor Museum","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70385113/Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","fileMasterId":70385113,"fileName":"Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1360},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2048}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T10:28:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"beaulieu-national-motor-museum-line-of-toy-cars-1","title":"Beaulieu National Motor Museum","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70385113/Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","fileMasterId":70385113,"fileName":"Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1360},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2048}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T10:28:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"beaulieu-national-motor-museum-line-of-toy-cars-1","title":"Beaulieu National Motor Museum","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70385113/Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","fileMasterId":70385113,"fileName":"Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1360},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2048}}},"pages":[{"id":668312,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<em>This article originally appeared on the <a href=\"http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/1405-museum-sets-new-record-for-longest-line-of-toy-cars/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> of Automobile Magazine.</em><br>\n<br>\n<strong>We spent many hours creating races and traffic jams with toy cars,</strong> but never did our exploits reach the lengths achieved by the U.K.'s National Motor Museum.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-15T15:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"genesis-homepage","title":"2015 hyundai genesis","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70864888/genesis-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70864888,"fileName":"genesis-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-15T15:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"genesis-homepage","title":"2015 hyundai genesis","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70864888/genesis-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70864888,"fileName":"genesis-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-15T15:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"genesis-header2","title":"2015 hyundai genesis","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70864882/genesis-header2.jpg","fileMasterId":70864882,"fileName":"genesis-header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-15T15:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"genesis-homepage","title":"2015 hyundai genesis","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70864888/genesis-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70864888,"fileName":"genesis-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":672508,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Price:</strong> $38,950 (including destination charge); AWD model is $40,500 (including destination charge) <br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.8-liter V-6, 311 horsepower, 293 pound-feet of torque<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Eight-speed automatic with paddle shifters <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 18 mpg city/29 mpg highway (AWD model: 16/25 mpg)<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Hyundai BlueLink telematics system with Siri integration <br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Matte wood (only available by purchasing all three option packages, $11,000)<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Navigation system with rearview camera, lumbar support on driver's seat, height-adjustable passenger's seat with lumbar support, HD radio, Sirius XM Travel Link, proximity sensing key, push-button start <br>\n<strong>Notable options:</strong> Panoramic sunroof (part of Signature package, $4,000);  lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, smart cruise control with full stop, parking assist (part of Tech package, $3,500); head-up display and CO2 sensor (part of Ultimate package, $3,500) <br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Acura RLX, BMW 528i, Buick LaCrosse, Cadillac CTS, Lexus GS350, Lincoln MKZ, Mercedes-Benz E350<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2015 hyundai genesis","caption":"","fileMasterId":70864927,"fileName":"genesis-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70864927/genesis-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>When I say Genesis, do you think of Phil Collins?

The MDX’s interior isn’t quite cutting edge, but it does handle the task of making a seven-seater feel spacious and comfortable.  With spacious front seats, a reclining second row, and an available rear video monitor, the MDX could be the answer for moms who shun the minivan.

Acura’s silky-smooth manual transmission is available in the sedan. The TSX compliments its punchy engine with a new, smoother suspension. The sedan has a paltry 12.6 cubic feet of trunk storage, but this car was clearly not built to move a family cross-country, and with its other features you might not miss the space. If you do need more room in the back, the wagon has twice the cargo space of the sedan. Believe it or not, a car this fun to drive doesn’t have to be a gas guzzler. At 19 to 22 mpg in the city and 28 to 31 mpg on the highway, the TSX is more efficient than Acura’s more sedate (read: boring) sedans. Its relatively low cost is reflected in the lack of a navigation system in the manual, and the more powerful V-6 comes at a premium. These small sacrifices just might be worth it for the chance to drive the TSX.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>:7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Car Guide","caption":"","fileMasterId":41467115,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41467115/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

I have previously appeared as a lifeguard, a mailroom lackey, a part-time nanny, and a fudge chef, but the real reason I'm here today is because someone once told me I could write and I believed them. As a writer and publisher for BU’s online magazine, I wrote about politics and current events and wrote two series: Foxy Congressperson of the Week, which is exactly what it sounds like, and An American in Paris, detailing my misadventures abroad. \n\nGrowing up in Southeastern Michigan means that love of cars is practically a birthright, and one I’ve always been proud of. I still drive my first car, a beloved orange Chevy HHR that has been through the war and keeps on chugging. After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Tech News","id":1034781,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/car-tech-news","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T15:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40478006/audi-wifi-hot-spot-pl.jpg","fileMasterId":40478006,"fileName":"audi-wifi-hot-spot-pl.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":390},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":692}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T15:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40478003/audi-wifi-hot-spot-header.jpg","fileMasterId":40478003,"fileName":"audi-wifi-hot-spot-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":390},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":693}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T15:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40477952/audi-wifi-hot-spot-hp.jpg","fileMasterId":40477952,"fileName":"audi-wifi-hot-spot-hp.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":238933,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Cars that act as mobile WiFi hotspots are growing common.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Babies","id":1034771,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/kids-in-the-car/babies","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Safety ","id":1023754,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/car-safety","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"All Videos","id":1023756,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Kids in the Car","id":1034769,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[{"articleId":222737,"name":"article0","promoImage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T17:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40483418/what-car-seat-when+promo-large.jpg","fileMasterId":40483418,"fileName":"what-car-seat-when+promo-large.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":300},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":533}},"promoTeaser":"Yes, your eight-year-old still needs a car seat.

So why do people still buy the Corolla en masse? Simple: it’s simple…as in uncomplicated, plain, or as some might say, dull. And to be fair, one person’s dull is another’s “reliable transportation,” and don’t expect us to argue with that. But don’t expect us to get too excited about it, either, as the only available engine remains a wimpy 132-horsepower 1.8-liter four-cylinder mated to five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmissions. The Corolla LE and S models receive some reconstituted option packages, and a new 6.1-inch screen-based interface for the Display Audio system.

Along with Honda’s dowdy Insight, the Prius c was designed to satisfy the burgeoning demand for more affordable hybrids. Although it is hardly a thing of beauty, it is easier to look at than the regular Prius, with its more conventional profile and whimsical color palette. Heck, we give it a pass simply for not looking “like a hybrid” (i.e., doorstop chic). We can’t give it the same kudos for the way it drives, as it is suuuh-looooow, with a total of just 99 horsepower combined between its gasoline and electric powertrains. Yawn. Worse still is that it isn’t any more fuel efficient overall than the heavier, more powerful non-c Prius, which gets the same 50 mpg combined fuel economy rating from the EPA. Like the Prius, the c model does have an EV mode, which allows parking lot cruising to be done (up to a mile at speeds up to 25 mph) purely on electricity. But again, the whole point of the Prius c is not to out-Prius the Prius but to come in at a lower price point, and that it does, some $4,000 to $5,000 less than its bigger brother Prius. Even with all the bells and whistles, which include automatic climate control, push-button starting, fancy Display audio system with touchscreen operation, power exterior mirrors, heated seats, and more, the Prius c costs barely more than the lowest grade of standard Prius. For a 50-mpg car, that’s a pretty good deal.

For a broad upgrade in performance and luxury, add the Inscription package, which first and foremost boosts the engine’s output to 250 horsepower. The Inscription also includes gloss black trim rather than bright pieces, black wheels, a leather-covered dashboard, and rich leather upholstery. T5, Premier Plus, and Platinum trim levels are offered. The latter adds a premium sound system.

The sleekness gets an appropriate complement this year in outrageous Flamenco Red and Rebel Blue metallic, available colors that will provoke indignation in the school drop-off line.

A 240-horsepower 3.2-liter six-cylinder powers the 3.2, while the T6 has a 300-horsepower 3.0-liter turbocharged six (325 horsepower in the R-Design).

Cadillac is promoting this car in grand style, aiming it at people who would otherwise be looking at German performance cars. In fact, Cadillac has had BMW’s 3-series and other German sport sedans in its sights for years. With the ATS, which it tested at Germany’s Nürburgring racetrack, among other places, it may have hit the target. What’s most interesting about the ATS? It weighs less than 3,400 pounds, pretty slim for its size. It is a traditional rear-wheel-drive sport sedan, but all-wheel drive is also available. Cadillac makes much of the car’s fifty-fifty weight balance, ultra-efficient and driver-adjustable sport suspension, Brembo brakes, and long, sleek body on a 109.3-inch wheelbase. But what you’ll notice even before you take off are the interior elements. There’s carbon fiber, wood, and metal plate trim; a wraparound instrument panel with LED lighting on the gauges; and a full palette of color schemes. You can dress it up with Bose stereo, navigation, the Cadillac User Experience information and entertainment system with eight-inch touchscreen, and performance seats with power-adjustable bolsters. Safety options are the complete package, too: intelligent brake assist, forward collision alert, lane departure warning, a rear-vision camera, and side blind zone alert, among others. But what Cadillac wants you to take most to heart is a thrilling driving experience from the 272-horsepower four-cylinder turbo engine.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tBMW 3-Series<br />\n2.\tMercedes-Benz C250<br />\n3.\tAudi A4<br />","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421904,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421904/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech:</strong><br />\n1.\tCadillac User Experience information/entertainment system, making its debut on the XTS and ATS this year.<br />\n2.\tFront and rear automatic brakes use short-range radar technology and ultrasonic sensors to prevent low-speed collisions.<br />\n3.\tFive-link independent rear suspension, a first for Cadillac.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421907,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421907/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks:</strong><br />\n1.\tThey call it Art & Science design language; we call it ruggedly handsome, even sexy.<br />","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"Sedans","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20244,"make":"Cadillac","model":"ATS","year":2013},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":10},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:13:26.089-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546406089 }} },{ "_id":222421,"title":"2013 GMC Savana","subTitle":"Whether you carry people or boxes, GMC’s big Savana van can hold lots of ‘em.

Full-size vans are generally little more than big, graceless transportation appliances designed not for the driver, but rather for what’s behind him or her. So who’s going to notice—or care, really—that the Savana hasn’t changed much for the last sixteen years? Probably no one, unless they know that Ford just launched its all-new, full-sized 2013 Transit van, that Nissan sells a big box called NV, or that Ram is rumored to be launching a replacement for the Dodge Sprinter, which, by the way, is still sold here by Mercedes-Benz. Compared with all of those, the Savana feels decidedly old-school, and less roomy. And while it offers a slew of engines ranging from a puny V-6 to an E85-capable gasoline V-8 to a torque-laden 6.6-liter diesel V-8, and has added park assist, a rear camera, and navigation-assisted radio options, the Savana is unremarkable and outdated.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 1","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Mazda 5 is a small minivan with the classic minivan sliding side doors. Yet it has managed to avoid the dreaded minivan stigma. It was redesigned in 2012 and is so stylish that it won’t even matter if you carry a diaper bag in your daily life. The Mazda 5 is a surprisingly versatile vehicle that can seat up to six people in three rows. On the safety side, all passengers – even those in the rear – are protected by side curtain air bags. On the plus side, the little Japanese minivan offers nimble handling, excellent steering feel, good visibility, and a configurable interior. The second-row captain’s chairs slide, recline, and fold flat, and the third-row seats have a fifty-fifty split so they can be tipped forward to create a flat loading area. It should be noted here that there is limited cargo room in the rear with the seats up. A 157-horsepower 2.5 liter four-cylinder engine is the sole engine available. It is linked to a six-speed manual transmission or a five-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy is so-so at 21 mpg in city driving and 28 mpg on the highway with either transmission, according to the EPA. That’s just a little better than the bigger Chrysler Town & Country minivan, which returns 17 mpg in city driving and 25 mpg on the highway and offers a lot more room.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

You’ll notice that the DBS has more nuanced looks. But is sheet metal botox worth the additional $70,000 price tag? You be the judge. If you pose this question in Hollywood and certain blocks on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the answer is a resounding yes, so you’re answer is predicated on perspective. The DBS can be ordered as a two-door coupe or in convertible form as the Volante. It qualifies as both fast and foxy, reaching from 0 to 60 mph in 4.3 seconds and topping out at 190 mph. DBS went out with a high-gloss bang, releasing The Carbon Edition model for 2012, which features ten-spoke, gloss-black wheels and a Matrix-style carbon fiber cabin that is sold in flame orange, ceramic gray, and carbon black metallic.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 9","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

It wins points as a driver’s car, but in the end may be impractical for some families. The Juke – which has been compared to a frog in the looks department – was designed to blend the benefits of a crossover with a sports car. The Juke’s standard turbocharged 1.6-liter inline four-cylinder engine provides 188 horses and punchy acceleration. The engine is linked to either a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission that comes with the all-wheel-drive model. A three-mode drive selector – Normal for everyday driving, Sport for a more performance feel and Eco for maximum fuel efficient – gives the driver some interesting choices. Fuel economy is decent. The Juke with the CVT returns 27 mpg in city driving and 32 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The six-speed manual transmission model returns 25 mpg in city driving and 31 mpg on the highway. Tight rear seats and a relatively small cargo hold may limit the Juke’s appeal. The printed fabrics and hard plastic trim in the cabin look a little cheap. The Juke is not for everyone, but it excels with a powerful engine, confidence-inspiring handling, and optional all-wheel drive – and there are eight models to choose from.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7.5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Hang on: you’ll experience the refined grumble of a sophisticated twin-turbo V-8 engine, but there is little noise that can make its way in this well constructed cabin. What you’re paying for in the Bentley is quality, detail and impeccable function.  Patience is part of the ethos of Bentley manufacturing. It takes a 170 hands-on hours to build a Bentley Mulsanne at the factory in Crewe, England. Bentley has added high-tech nuances from the get-go in the Mulsanne model, such as the eight-inch color screen and the sixty-gigabyte hard drive. Here’s where Mulsanne is besting itself with new packages and options for technological splendor. Now you can’t just park a Bentley Mulsanne anywhere, so please travel with an extra stack of $20 spots for the valets.

That’s all changed for 2013 with the introduction of a new Veloster Turbo model to the line-up. The turbo model’s new 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder GDI engine churns out 201 horsepower, enough to make this model a serious competitor against the Honda Civic Coupe Si and the Volkswagen GTI. The engine is linked to either a six-speed manual transmission or six-speed automatic transmission. Hyundai expects the Veloster Turbo to return an estimated 38 mpg on the highway. There’s even more excitement on tap, since Hyundai has introduced one of the first matte paint treatments in the industry on the Veloster Turbo. The $1,000 optional matte gray paint is a study in high maintenance, however, since the paint comes with an eleven-page owner’s manual, a wash pad, and microfiber towels. Buyers should be prepared to shell out $4,500 more for the Veloster Turbo than they would for the base car. But they can expect extra features, such as standard heated front seats, a unique front fascia and ground effects. Both the Veloster Turbo and base Veloster handle corners with ease and make living easy in the cabin thanks to clever packaging.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br /> \n1.

The carryover 2013 Hyundai Tucson, which gets a few tweaks for the new model year, crossed what may be a critically important barrier for some shoppers when it passed the $20,000 mark for the first time. The base 2013 Hyundai Tucson GL starts at $20,070, including an $825 destination charge. Hyundai has been steadily moving upmarket with all of its vehicles lately – but the good news is that Tucson is still significantly cheaper than most of its Japanese competition, including the Honda CR-V. The 2013 Tucson gets some modest upgrades, including heated front seats on the GLS FWD model, a proximity key entry with push-button start on the Limited trim, foglights, and automatic headlight control on the GLS. The Tucson is also a stellar performer at the fuel pump. The Tucson GLS with a 176-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and six-speed automatic transmission returns 22 mpg in city driving and 32 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The Tucson also gets high marks for its agile handling and responsive steering. The Tucson can be ordered with an all-wheel-drive system. The 2013 Tucson with AWD features hill start assist control and downhill brake control, two features typically found on luxury SUVs. Families will appreciate the amenities, too, including nineteen different storages places and drink holders in the cabin.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The thinking here is that there’s no need to remove a child seat to access the third row. The JX is something of a technological powerhouse as well, with options like a backup collision intervention system, an industry first. If a reversing driver doesn’t spot a car or pedestrian approaching from the side, the JX flashes a warning, then pushes back against the driver’s throttle foot and finally brakes to prevent a crash. The JX’s base price of $41,400, including a $950 destination charge, can rapidly escalate, with the addition of such items as all-wheel drive and five option packages. They include a $4,950 Premium package that includes a navigation system, Around View monitor and a thirteen-speaker Bose sound system. A Driver Assistance package adds another $2,200 to the bottom line and adds the back-up collision intervention system, intelligent cruise control, a blind spot warning system, and heated steering wheel. A $1,700 Theater package bundles dual seven-inch color monitors, two wireless headphones and a 120-volt power outlet.

But the Rio’s optional Idle Stop and Go, or ISG, technology, which helps to cut fuel consumption, is a $400 option. The technology improves fuel economy by turning the engine off when the vehicle is not in motion – such as at a stoplight or in traffic – and automatically restarting when the driver releases the brake pedal. The ISG technology, which is usually offered on hybrids only, is bundled in an Eco package that also includes an Eco badge.

That really depends on which model you go for. If you are more interested in the handsome low-slung body, the V-6-powered LS coupe and LT convertible may be plenty for you. But if you’re looking for serious performance, there’s the V-8-powered SS coupe and convertible. The manual-transmission SS lets you opt for the track-oriented 1LE performance package, which includes suspension modifications and twenty-inch Goodyear Eagle tires—plus a matte black hood, front splitter, rear-spoiler, and black-finished ten-spoke wheels. Atop the Camaro food chain is the ZL1, new last year, which has a 580-horsepower supercharged V-8, Magnetic Ride Control and an advanced chassis and suspension setup. That’s good for 0 to 60 mph in four seconds, a top speed of 184 mph, and an 11-second quarter-mile time. Chevrolet calls the ZL1 the “everyday supercar.” The ZL1 has started to pass some of its finer qualities down the lineup, with the ZL1-style shift knob, variable-effort electric power steering, and optional dual-mode exhaust now for any manual-transmission Camaro. Inside, the interior is not as buff as the outward appearance, although it does have Chevrolet MyLink and color touchscreen radio, plus optional GPS navigation. Bottom line, though: you just can’t stop looking at it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 8-9","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

A 3.6-liter V-6 engine also comes standard, but you can upgrade to a 5.7- or 6.4-liter Hemi V-8. They’re both gas guzzlers, but they make for a great time on the road! Not only is the 300 fun to drive, but with the engine upgrade, you get an entertainment upgrade as well: you can have studio-quality surround sound while you drive thanks to the Beats by Dr. Dre audio system. Premium Nappa leather in Radar Red makes the interior extra sporty and might even make the need for speed a bit harder to resist. But if these extras don’t appeal to you, that’s okay.

There’s an optional 4.2-inch LCD information screen that offers fuel economy and performance information. The colorful screen’s Track Apps practically beg you to test the car’s (and your) limits with an acceleration timer, brake performance measurements—even a drag strip-style Christmas tree countdown feature. A V-6-powered version of this car gets 31 un-Mustang-like mpg on the highway. On the other hand, those who want to take the V-8-powered Mustang GT out on the track will appreciate the optional GT Track package, which adds an engine cooler, performance brake pads, and other upgrades. The most insane version is the Shelby GT500, which has a 650-horsepower supercharged V-8 and can exceed 200 mph. Slightly more sedate is the Boss 302 Mustang, with its 444 horsepower, six-speed manual transmission, and Recaro racing-style seats, not to mention reflective hockey-stick graphics that are meant to remind you of the 1969 Boss 302.

It makes up for its somewhat ungainly tall body by offering a low floor and high roof, wide-opening rear doors and a great deal of configuration choice—meaning everybody from flower shops to window repair companies can kit out a Transit Connect that is perfect for their needs. The load height is less than two feet, you can get doors that open up 255 degrees wide, and the turning circle is tight enough for the middle of downtown. The Transit Connect is highly modular, with all manner of bins and storage racks to choose for a custom setup. It’s also offered in alternative fuel (LPG or CNG) and electric versions and, to Ford’s credit, with a Motoring Mobility package for those with physical challenges. Use it as a cargo hauler with seats for two, or get it with a folding second row of seats so it can carry four or five people. It even gets 27 mpg on the highway. The only thing you shouldn’t expect is driving excitement, since this front-wheel-drive work vehicle has a 136-horsepower four-cylinder engine.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 2","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

They may not belong to one of the more recent model years, but there’s a reason why so many people are still driving their ten-year-old Foresters in 2012 and it’s the reason why you should take a look at a 2013 model if you’re looking for a new crossover. It’s a basic vehicle that can take the wear and tear accompanied with carting around luggage, athletic gear, and even the family dog. If you’re an outdoor enthusiast, that is definitely a plus. The 2.4-liter Boxer engine will give you a fuel economy of 21 mpg city and 27 mpg highway, which is an increase from 2011’s rating. If you want to enhance your driving experience, look into the models with the 224-horsepower turbocharged engine. For your driving safety and convenience, you can opt for adding a voice-activated navigation system to your Forester and one of two winter weather packages. Possibly the best thing about the Forester, besides its durability, is the all-wheel drive, which comes standard on all Subaru vehicles and will be with you for the years to come.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6<br />","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors: </strong><br />\n1.\tFord Escape<br />\n2.\tHonda CR-V<br />\n3.\tKia Sportage<br />","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech: </strong><br />\n1.

The hatchback’s low back end limits rear visibility, but the tight squeeze fits with the character of the car, though, and the 122 horsepower engine is able to provide some fun for the driver while still handling well. There are also three available drive modes, so that the driver can decide whether to conserve fuel or pump up the performance. The CR-Z gets a wallet-friendly 35 mpg in the city and 39 mpg highway.  Priced at $20,000 to $24,000, the CR-Z keeps with Honda’s tradition of offering impressive fuel economy without forcing you to mortgage your house, but if extra seating or cargo room are of any concern it might make sense to look at one of Honda’s hybrid sedans. On the other hand, if you don’t have kids or equipment to haul around (or if you make the kids walk so you can keep your sweet ride) the CR-Z is certainly worth a look.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

For trips to Ikea or cross-country moves, the rear seats fold seamlessly into the floor to maximize cargo space. The Odyssey runs a V-6 engine with either a five- or six-speed automatic transmission. It has Honda technology that allows some cylinders to shut off when not in use, helping it achieve a class-high 19 mpg city and 28 mpg highway. Perhaps best of all is an available giant rear video monitor with a split-screen to avoid tantrums if your brood can’t agree on a movie.

That price can rapidly escalate if such items as 50/50 split rear seats, a rear-seat entertainment system, rear console refrigerator, and a power trunk lid are on your shopping list. In that case, expect to pay over $67,000 for the 2013 Equus Ultimate edition. Despite the price increase, the Equus is still a relative bargain compared to most of the competition, including the Lexus LS 460 and BMW 750i sedan. The 2013 Equus is a carryover model with only minor upgrades. Last year, the Equus got major powertrain upgrades. It is equipped with a 429-horsepower 5.0-liter V-8 engine linked to an eight-speed automatic transmission.  Highlights for 2013 include a new White Satin exterior paint with a Saddle interior color combination. A new Gran Premio Gray exterior paint will also be available. Lots of attention is paid to ritzy touches on the Equus, including a leather-wrapped, French stitched instrument panel, a wood-and-heated leather steering wheel, and a massaging driver’s seat. The Equus is loaded with safety features, including nine air bags, smart cruise control, and a standard lane departure warning system. As Korean automaker Hyundai continues to burnish its image, it has rolled out the white-glove treatment for Equus owners. They can have the Equus picked up at their home or business for service appointments and get a complimentary loaner vehicle.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1. 2013 Lexus LS 460<br />\n2. 2013 Mercedes-Benz S550<br />\n3.

Callum rose to the challenge by going out on a limb and in reinterpreting the Jaguar exterior design. What he came up with is a unique sedan that’s helped revive Jaguar’s lineup. If you like exclusivity, the Supersport can only be purchased by custom order, which will grab you a supercharged 510-horsepower V-8 engine, leather headliner, and laser-engraved veneers. It’s still missing desirable features like Google Maps and in-car Internet. You can grow an extra 5.1 inches in the long-wheelbase version. Like the XF, the XJ adds all-wheel drive to its options for 2013. The lightweight aluminum structure makes the XJ a more graceful car than it’s considerable proportions would indicate. The AWD-equipped XJ is expected to deliver 25 mpg on the highway, which is pretty darn good for such a big boss car. The company adds the British-branded Meridian audio system for an all-encompassing sonic experience. The limited edition XJL Ultimate model comes with a beverage chiller, power-operated rear table, flute holder, and two iPads mounted in custom leather-trimmed docks, complete with keyboards.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Luckily, the Passat retains its well-balanced ride and plush interior, and for the daily commute or shuttling the kids around, the tamed Passat will do just fine. The Passat’s base models don’t have fantastic gas mileage, but a TDI clean diesel option gets 31 miles to the gallon in the city and 43 miles a gallon on the highway, almost as good as some hybrid models. The exterior is smooth and well built, but largely unremarkable. Where the Passat shines is in its interior, which looks like that of a more expensive car. Available features include leather seats, chrome trim, a touchscreen radio, a sunroof and a navigation system. Bluetooth connectivity comes standard. The expansive backseat means that even adults will be comfortable, and the middle seat in the back row makes the Passat a touch more practical than the CC or other four-passenger sedans.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

The Eos boasts a fun, revvy engine that won’t bore you behind the wheel. With ample room for four in a nicely appointed cabin, Volkswagen recommends the Eos for weekend trips for the whole family. In reality, the Eos would struggle to fit four suitcases with the top down (it stores in the trunk, taking up a considerable amount of cargo space) but with small suitcases and some ingenuity anything is possible. The Eos is the only hardtop convertible with a full-size retractable sunroof. The interior comes in four colors, including Red and Atlantic Blue for drivers with quirky taste. The Eos is a bit pricey compared to other Volkswagens, but with its unique array of features and surprising versatility, the Eos is a purchase you won’t regret.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 9","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong> <br />\n1.

Since then, the Kizashi hasn’t undergone many changes and, like its siblings the Grand Vitara and the Equator, exists under the average buyer’s radar despite sales promotions that can reduce the price of the car by $3,000. With a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, the Kizashi has a fuel economy of up to 23 mpg city and 30 mpg highway, making it great for those with long, cross-town commutes. Since long rides can be less than stimulating for the driver, Suzuki offers a Rockford ten-speaker sound system and heated leather seats on the Kizashi Sport SLS, which also allows you to stream music from your iPod via Bluetooth if the AM/FM radio doesn’t hold your interest. Long drives to and from work can also be hard on your car, but they shouldn’t be a problem with the Kizashi; this car held up after driving at top speeds on the Autobahn and rolling over cobblestone roads in England. You’ll be able to hear your music or news over the outside road noise thanks to the Kizashi’s sound installation even at high speeds. The French seams on both the cloth and leather seats add a nice touch to the car’s roomy interior.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tFord Fusion<br />\n2.\tHyundai Sonata<br />\n3.\tToyota Camry<br />\n4.\tVolkswagen Jetta<br />","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items: </strong><br />\n1.\tSmartPass keyless push start system. <br />\n2.\tRear sonar and backup camera.<br />","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks: </strong><br />\n1.\tCrimson Red Metallic exterior paint.<br />\n2.\tEighteen-inch wheels and spoiler on Sport models.<br />","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585478,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585478/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>New for 2013: </strong><br />\n1.

On the other hand, the rockin’ C63 AMG has a 6.2-liter V-8 that puts out 451 horsepower and takes no prisoners. A seven-speed automatic is included with every C-Class model. Sport sedans--notice that we’re pushing sport--have a flat-bottomed steering wheel and heartbreakingly beautiful ash wood trim. You’ll kick yourself for getting the floormats dirty.

Well, don’t make a decision just yet. The Subaru Legacy has been a solid performer since it’s redesign in 2010 and will continue to be with its new changes for 2013. Under the hood of the 2.5i, you’ll find the brand-new, 2.5 liter Boxer engine which achieves up to 32 mpg highway with standard all-wheel drive, making the Legacy the most fuel-efficient sedan on the American market. One of the great things about mid-size sedans is that they accommodate both the short and the tall comfortably, but the Legacy is roomier than most, boasting 103 cubic feet in passenger volume. However, more car can sometimes mean reduced visibility. That is remedied with the new EyeSight driver-assist. Not only does this system provide you with lane departure warnings and identify obstacles in traffic, but EyeSight can activate the brakes to avoid collision. So before you decide to put a hard-earned down payment on a Fusion or a Camry, take some time to look at the safer, sportier 2013 Legacy.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors: </strong><br />\n1.\tFord Fusion<br />\n2.\tToyota Camry<br />\n3.\tHonda Accord<br />\n4.\tVolkswagen Passat","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items: </strong><br />\n1.\tEyeSight driver assist system.<br />\n2.\tBluetooth hands-free phone capability.<br />\n3.\tHill holder system.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks: </strong><br />\n1.\tRedesigned front for a sportier look.<br />\n2.\tBody-color side mirrors.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585478,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585478/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>New for 2013: </strong><br />\n1.\tBrake override system.<br />\n2.\tEyeSight driver assist system.<br />\n3.\tSecond-generation Lineatronic continuously variable transmission.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"Sedans","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20438,"make":"Subaru","model":"Legacy","year":2013},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":7},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:13:35.261-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546415262 }} },{ "_id":222681,"title":"2013 Subaru BRZ","subTitle":"When you get into the all-new BRZ, all you’ll want to do is drive.","slug":"2013-subaru-brz","promoTitle":"2013 Subaru BRZ","promoTeaserSmall":"2013 Subaru BRZ","promoTeaser":"2013 Subaru BRZ","keywords":["2013 Subaru BRZ"],"metaTitle":"2013 Subaru BRZ Buyer's Guide -  Jean Knows Cars","metaKeywords":["2013","Subaru","BRZ"],"metaDescription":"Learn more about the 2013 Subaru BRZ here at JeanKnowsCars.com","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2012-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2012-09-28T17:26:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2012-09-28T17:26:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"buyer_guide","webExclusive":false,"url":"/new-cars/subaru/2013-subaru-brz/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[],"categories":[{"alias":"Subaru","id":1025701,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/new-cars/subaru","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"new-cars","id":1024395,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/new-cars","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-10-28T10:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"subaru-brz-2013-header","title":"Subaru Brz 2013 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/82565074/subaru-brz-2013-header.jpg","fileMasterId":82565074,"fileName":"subaru-brz-2013-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}}},"pages":[{"id":239408,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The all-new Subaru BRZ is a big departure from its siblings, equipped with rear-wheel drive, not the all-wheel drive Subarus are known for.

Driving the BRZ should be fun, and the engineers at Subaru want to make sure you keep your hands on the wheel and enjoy driving.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Reviews","id":1023765,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos/car-reviews","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"All Videos","id":1023756,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T16:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44260920/jeans-driveway-fiat-500-sport+promo-large.jpg","fileMasterId":44260920,"fileName":"jeans-driveway-fiat-500-sport+promo-large.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":721},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1280}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T16:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40480658/jeans-driveway-fiat-500-sport+header.jpg","fileMasterId":40480658,"fileName":"jeans-driveway-fiat-500-sport+header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":720},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1280}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T16:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44260917/jeans-driveway-fiat-500-sport+homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":44260917,"fileName":"jeans-driveway-fiat-500-sport+homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":418},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1280}}},"pages":[{"id":239496,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Look at the red one in the video, because the one on the right is my own and not the one we're talking about.

The Xterra appears set to live another day, since Nissan said the 2013 model will be available early next year, even though specifics will be announced at a later date. It is not expected to get a major revision. The truck-based Xterra is pitched at young, active buyers – and there’s even a built-in first-aid kit. It’s a truly capable off-roader, but suffers from mediocre gas mileage – the bane of traditional SUVs. The Xterra seats up to five and is equipped with a strong 261-horsepower 4.0-liter V-6 engine. The engine can be mated to either a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. The Xterra’s macho off-road capabilities make it less comfortable and proficient on the road than similarly priced, more refined crossovers. It is built on the same tough F-Alpha platform as Nissan trucks like the Titan and Frontier. The soft suspension on Xterra can make for a bouncy ride on hard pavement, too. The interior is far from luxurious and can’t be hosed out as easily as the cabin in the Jeep Wrangler. Extras on Xterra include a locking rear differential, skid plates, roof-mounted lights, and ceiling hooks in the cargo area.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5.5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Two dozen years later, Lexus once again is putting the industry on notice with its latest technological tour de force, the all-new, surprisingly emotional 2013 LS. Indeed, the LS460 and the long-wheelbase LS460L have never looked better, their crisp sheetmetal offset by just the right amount of ornamentation. Lexus’s new spindle grille is flanked by high-tech headlamps, the bodysides are clean and straight, and the rear is set off by discreet trapezoidal tailpipes and beautiful taillamps with clever L-shaped LED strips that mimic the Lexus “L.” For 2013, Lexus is offering more flavors of LS than ever: customers with a wild side may opt for the first-ever LS F-Sport model, which rides lower to the ground and dons aggressive front and rear styling and technical-themed interior trim; those in colder climes may be interested in all-wheel-drive LS models; wealthy greenies may consider the pricey hybrid LS600h. Regardless of variety, each LS contains more standard comfort and technology features than we could possibly list, and among the many decadent options are a shiatsu massaging rear seat package, three different wood choices, and a “Climate Concierge” system that automatically activates seat heaters and coolers in addition to the A/C to maintain individual comfort for all passengers. The LS even rides on noise reduction wheels to ensure quietness. Once focused on chasing the luxury leaders in the segment, the 2013 LS proves that Lexus wants to lead.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\r\n1.

I'm lucky enough--or foolish enough--to be able to turn most of my avocations into something resembling a vocation. Except for motherhood, but that's its own reward, right?\n\nI was a record store geek back when there were record stores, and worked at the venerable (and late, lamented) Schoolkids' Records in Ann Arbor through college, while spinning jazz records at WEMU to the taxi drivers, barflies and night owls who listened during the wee hours. I then spent a dozen years as the corporate jazz buyer for the Borders Books & Music chain, a job that even in hindsight seems too good to be true.  After the music business--and Borders-imploded, I pursued another passion and joined the staff of AnnArbor.com as a food writer and community content coordinator. I spend a lot of time cooking, eating and writing, which also often feels too good to be true.\n \nAnd now cars. I’ve been a car geek since I could walk. I caught the bug from my dad, who saved up the paychecks he earned pumping gas as a teen in western New York until he could afford a gorgeous vintage 1939 Oldsmobile. My first car was my parents’ old Dodge Spirit--an innocuous-looking car that hid a turbocharged V6 under the hood. That car took me all over the country--and fast. If I shoved a Kleenex in the tape player to stop the rattling, I could easily cruise at 120 mph, a thought that now--as a mom--strikes fear in my heart.","fileMasterId":39817187,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39817187/39817187.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T12:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41118322/decompress-your-music-in-the-car+ipod-music-promo-large.jpg","fileMasterId":41118322,"fileName":"decompress-your-music-in-the-car+ipod-music-promo-large.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2190},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":3888}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T12:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41118319/decompress-your-music-in-the-car+ipod-music-promo-header.jpg","fileMasterId":41118319,"fileName":"decompress-your-music-in-the-car+ipod-music-promo-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2188},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":3888}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T12:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41118394/decompress-your-music-in-the-car+ipod-music-promo-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":41118394,"fileName":"decompress-your-music-in-the-car+ipod-music-promo-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1270},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":3888}}},"pages":[{"id":239644,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Music and cars have long gone hand in hand.

what you’re after is a hard-working van that has no pretensions of passenger comfort, Chevrolet’s Express could be exactly what you’re looking for. The Express can tow 6,200 pounds even in its most modest configuration, and it is available in so many versions that there’s sure to be one for any work application—with special packages for ambulance and hotel shuttle uses. Rear- or four-wheel-drive models are available, and in standard and extended lengths, light-duty or heavy-duty versions, and passenger or cargo versions. In its most extended form, the Express can seat  fifteen people; in its most muscle-bound form, it can tow 10,000 pounds. Its fully boxed frame gives it strength, if not beauty. The cargo version of the Express can be equipped with a compressed natural gas package, and the Express lineup also includes a choice five gas/flex-fuel engines and a turbo-diesel. Some modern touches, including a backup camera, a navigation-capable radio, and ultrasonic rear parking assist, have been added for 2013; all are optional. The chrome appearance package and optional Sirius XM satellite radio make the workday go more pleasantly, but this is no consumer-market minivan, nor does it try to be.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 3","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tFord E-Series<br />\n2.\tGMC Savana<br />\n3.\tNissan NV","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items:</strong><br />\n1.\tDedicated CNG version.<br />\n2.\tComputer-controlled glow plugs start turbo-diesel engine in less than three seconds in temperatures as low as negative twenty degrees Fahrenheit without a block heater.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks:</strong><br />\n1.\tDoor choices include 60/40 split-folding passenger’s and driver’s door.<br />\n2.\tWheatland Yellow a new exterior color choice. <br />\n3.\tChrome appearance package.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585478,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585478/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>New for 2013:</strong><br />\n1.\tRear park assist, backup camera (optional).<br />\n2.\tNavigation radio (optional).","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"Crossover","color":"","id":20600,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Express","year":2013},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":8},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:13:38.217-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546418218 }} },{ "_id":223173,"title":"2013 Mazda 6","subTitle":"The 2013 Mazda 6 is a sportier alternative to mainstream sedans.","slug":"2013-mazda-6","promoTitle":"2013 Mazda 6","promoTeaserSmall":"2013 Mazda 6","promoTeaser":"2013 Mazda 6","keywords":["2013 Mazda 6"],"metaTitle":"2013 Mazda 6--Buyer's Guide--Jean Knows Cars","metaKeywords":["2013","mazda 6","mazda"],"metaDescription":"Learn more about the 2013 Mazda 6 here at JeanKnowsCars.com","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2012-10-04T11:53:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2012-10-04T11:53:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"buyer_guide","webExclusive":false,"url":"/new-cars/mazda/2013-mazda-6/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[],"categories":[{"alias":"Mazda","id":1025683,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/new-cars/mazda","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-10-28T10:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mazda-6-2013i-header","title":"Mazda 6 2013I Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/82564804/mazda-6-2013i-header.jpg","fileMasterId":82564804,"fileName":"mazda-6-2013i-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}}},"pages":[{"id":240122,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The Mazda 6 has always been an excellent choice if you’re the type of person who cringes when you see another person wearing the same dress as you at a party.

Mazda is in something of a holding pattern with the Mazda 6 at this point, since a fully redesigned model is coming out for 2014. In the meantime, there are no significant changes to the Mazda 6. The current-generation sedan has a striking presence, with a long hood and flared front fenders. Mazda pitches it as \"sexy, yet sensible.\" The base model is nicely equipped with standard air conditioning, power accessories, cruise control, and a stereo system with six speakers. The base Mazda 6 is equipped with a 170-horsepower 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine linked to a six-speed manual transmission. The top-of-the-line model gets a 272-horsepower 3.7-liter V-6 engine linked to a six-speed automatic transmission. There are numerous options, including a rear spoiler, remote engine start on automatic-transmission models, pearl exterior paint, and a power moonroof. A $1,785 technology package bundles several items, including LED rear lights, heated side mirrors, and a power front passenger’s seat.

The front-wheel-drive Rogue returns a respectable 23 mpg in city driving and 28 mpg on the highway.

As with the Camry, the Venza is a very good car that offers Lexus-like quietness and a spacious and nicely assembled and somewhat austere cabin. It is available in three trim levels and behind its new headlamps and gaping, chrome-drenched grille is the choice of fuel-efficient four- or six-cylinder engines. Something the Venza does not inherit from the Camry is a hybrid version, but it does trump its sedan sibling by offering all-wheel drive. The Venza also provides its occupants with a taller-than-usual seating position for excellent outward vision, at least to the front (rear vision is hampered by thick pillars), while ample storage awaits out back. Families needing a third-row seat and/or an even better view of the road ahead could look at the Highlander (which, incidentally, is also Camry-based) but they won’t get as car-like an experience as offered by the Venza.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 4","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong>:<br/>\n1.

The study, administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI), involves nearly 3,000 cars outfitted with special communication devices for research. The cars interact with one another and with signals posted permanently at intersections, on sharp curves, and on the M-14 and US-23 freeways. The study focuses on the northeast area of Ann Arbor, and participants will have the testing equipment installed in their cars over a twelve-month period. This connected vehicle study just got under way several weeks ago, part of a thirty-month overall research project. The UMTRI's director, Peter Sweatman, has said, “We feel honored to be hosting the national test environment for vehicles that don’t crash.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Connected vehicles are getting more and more buzz lately, and for good reason. The UMTRI believes that the technology has the potential to reduce up to 80 percent of \"unimpaired crashes,\" according to Francine Romine, director of communications at UMTRI. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that there are more than 10 million car crashes yearly on American roads. In 2009, the most recent year for which there's data, there were 10.8 million accidents.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"Of the cars participating in the study, the vast majority--about 2,800--carry a Vehicle Awareness Device, or VAD, which emits a signal that can be picked up by similar devices in other cars. Only about 300 cars carry a device that can both send and receive signals. Drivers of those cars get warnings when they are following another study-equipped vehicle too closely, when they may need to brake unexpectedly, or when they are approaching a sharp curve, among other things. Jim Sayer, UMTRI’s project manager for the study, says \"the real benefits will come from [devices] that both transmit and receive,\" but in order to get that data, the cars need a large pool of signals to react to.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"David Cahill, pictured here, is one of the Ann Arborites who volunteered for the connected vehicle study, and he told Jean Knows Cars about his experience. The vehicle awareness device in his car is one of the transmit-only variety.  He told us that, when the device was installed in early August, the other more advanced devices \"were not yet ready or working.\" Although the study's piece of equipment equipment, a GPS antenna taped to his windshield and shown with this article, came unstuck the day after it was installed, UMTRI told him that signal transmission would not be interrupted, and they eventually repaired the device. Aside from that issue, Cahill says the device is \"completely innocuous\" and has not interfered with his driving at all.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Cahill became interested in the study after reading about it online. He says he is \"really impressed with anything that will improve traffic safety and move toward automation,\" adding that he favors any technology that takes \"second-to-second control of a two-ton vehicle\" out of the hands of drivers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"At the end of the yearlong study, participants will receive $200. Cahill said this didn't have an impact on his choice to  participate. An interesting angle the study organizers took was to recruit among parents in the Ann Arbor Public Schools in the northeast side of town being studied, with the $200 being donated to school at the end. Romine of UMTRI said the study considered stay-at-home parents ideal candidates because of the amount of time they spend driving in the study area. Romine noted that parents often travel \"12,000 to 13,000 miles a year just driving their kids.\"","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"A few commercial vehicles have also been outfitted, and UMTRI's Sayer says there is the potential for applications to be developed that could help long-haul truck drivers to find places to park overnight. Those applications don’t exist yet, but researchers at UMTRI and other institutions are looking into developing them.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"Many in the industry and elsewhere consider connected vehicles as a crucial steppingstone to autonomous cars, although there is no reliable estimate for when cars could kick humans out of the driver’s seat. Sayer, for his part, expects that \"there will be radar-based wireless and vehicle-based systems for a long time\" before the leap to automation.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"If the idea of hooking your car up to a wireless network concerns you, rest assured that a lot of effort has gone into making sure the network is secure. When signing up for the study, Cahill was assured that all data gathered from him or his vehicle would be kept private.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"Sayer says that privacy concerns are not the biggest issue, since many of the devices used in the study do not store data. Rather, the concern is that \"someone could introduce some rogue signals\" into the environment, which could cause the devices to behave erratically. Sayer says that both device manufacturers and the federal government have worked to make the system secure.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"It will take time to hear about the results of the study.  After collecting data from vehicles at several points throughout the year, UMTRI will send the data to the Department of Transportation for analysis. No matter what the results tell us about the future of driving and traffic safety, the study’s placement in Ann Arbor is meaningful to Michigan residents, who have faced years of hard times and doubts about the future of the auto industry in this state. Cahill says he is \"delighted\" that this largest-of-its-kind study has a home here.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"And so are we!

I really don't. The freedom of getting behind the wheel of a car and just taking off can't be compared with anything else. You really feel that you’re in charge: in charge of the car, in charge of the road, and in charge of your life. Why on earth would you want someone else to drive you around when you could do it yourself? It’s so liberating! Obviously, I love driving. I suppose that isn't a particularly original statement for a Detroit native, but it's true. I was a little late getting my driver's license because of that pesky parallel parking, but once I got it, nothing could stop me. It doesn't matter if I have to chauffeur my grandmother to the bank less than a block from our house or drive across town.

She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn’t as dry as a piece of chalk…And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there. Not only am I a bibliophile, but I’m also a self-proclaimed Anglophile who loves Shakespeare and Elizabethan verse and one day plans to see the Houses of Parliament, visit the Tower of London, and, perhaps most important, eat real fish and chips.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

My first articles focused on efforts by legislators to make once heavily polluting cars run cleaner. When I moved back to Michigan, that became my focus as I contributed extensively to the Detroit bureaus of both the New York <em>Times</em> and <em>Newsweek. </em>I became fascinated by how the automobile impacts so many aspects of our lives and reflects our styles and preferences. \n\nOver the past two dozen years as a freelancer, I've covered the auto industry for a wide variety of publications, including <em>Popular Mechanics, Scientific American,</em> iVillage, A<em>utomotive News, Ad Age, Hemispheres, Technology Review,</em> and <em>AARP. </em>I've also contributed pieces on air to public radio. My coverage has focused on such issues as the ways domestic automakers will respond to increasingly tough mandates for fuel-efficient cars while still designing vehicles that appeal to consumers, and my firsthand—and slightly scary—experience driving an autonomous car.
