Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding.

I was, however, impressed that inside the cabin you could not really hear the burbling diesel engine. I found the transmission was a bit clunky when driving at low speeds but perfectly fine otherwise.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Editor","Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-20T08:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-hrv-homepage","title":"Honda Hrv Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/84405123/honda-hrv-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":84405123,"fileName":"honda-hrv-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-20T08:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-hrv-homepage","title":"Honda Hrv Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/84405123/honda-hrv-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":84405123,"fileName":"honda-hrv-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-20T08:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-hrv-header","title":"Honda Hrv Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87694330/honda-hrv-header.jpg","fileMasterId":87694330,"fileName":"honda-hrv-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-20T08:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-hrv-homepage","title":"Honda Hrv Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/84405123/honda-hrv-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":84405123,"fileName":"honda-hrv-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":876560,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"We have to confess our disappointment with the 2016 Honda HR-V, which was introduced at the Los Angeles Auto Show.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-19T10:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"audi-tt-homepage","title":"Audi Tt Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87625264/audi-tt-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":87625264,"fileName":"audi-tt-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-19T10:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"audi-tt-homepage","title":"Audi Tt Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87625264/audi-tt-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":87625264,"fileName":"audi-tt-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-19T10:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"audi-tt-header","title":"Audi Tt Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87625258/audi-tt-header.jpg","fileMasterId":87625258,"fileName":"audi-tt-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-19T10:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"audi-tt-homepage","title":"Audi Tt Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87625264/audi-tt-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":87625264,"fileName":"audi-tt-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":876814,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"To improve the third-generation 2016 Audi TT Coupe and Roadster, CrossFit trainers evidently got involved in the development process.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-01-19T18:53:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mercedes-gla-homepage","title":"Mercedes Gla Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/86836658/mercedes-gla-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":86836658,"fileName":"mercedes-gla-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-01-19T18:53:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mercedes-gla-homepage","title":"Mercedes Gla Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/86836658/mercedes-gla-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":86836658,"fileName":"mercedes-gla-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-01-19T18:53:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mercedes-gla-header","title":"Mercedes Gla Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/86836655/mercedes-gla-header.jpg","fileMasterId":86836655,"fileName":"mercedes-gla-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":878083,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Price:</strong> $63,575 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.0-liter AMG turbocharged four-cylinder <br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Seven-speed AMG Speedshift dual-clutch transmission with paddle shifters <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 23 mpg city/29 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> AMG engine<br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Panorama sunroof ($1,480)<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Eco start/stop, collision prevention assist, Attention Assist<br>\n<strong>Notable options:</strong> Red brake calipers ($300); Multimedia package ($2480); AMG performance seats ($2,250)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"To borrow a phrase from my dear friend Nelly, “It’s getting hot in herre.\" [<em>sic</em>]","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"The introduction of the Mercedes-Benz GLA45 AMG into one of the hottest segments in the U.S. market—compact SUVs—is cause for celebration.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Driving Tips","id":1034956,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-driving-tips","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-12-09T10:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"winterdriving-homepage","title":"Winterdriving Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/89063854/winterdriving-homepage.png","fileMasterId":89063854,"fileName":"winterdriving-homepage.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-12-09T10:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"winterdriving-homepage","title":"Winterdriving Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/89063854/winterdriving-homepage.png","fileMasterId":89063854,"fileName":"winterdriving-homepage.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-12-09T10:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"winterdriving-header","title":"Winterdriving Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/89063851/winterdriving-header.jpg","fileMasterId":89063851,"fileName":"winterdriving-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-12-09T10:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"winterdriving-homepage","title":"Winterdriving Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/89063854/winterdriving-homepage.png","fileMasterId":89063854,"fileName":"winterdriving-homepage.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":878084,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"I hate crashing.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-12-15T13:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ducati-homepage","title":"Ducati Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/80969990/ducati-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":80969990,"fileName":"ducati-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-12-15T13:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ducati-homepage","title":"Ducati Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/80969990/ducati-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":80969990,"fileName":"ducati-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-12-15T13:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ducati-header","title":"Ducati Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/80970044/ducati-header.jpg","fileMasterId":80970044,"fileName":"ducati-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-12-15T13:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ducati-homepage","title":"Ducati Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/80969990/ducati-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":80969990,"fileName":"ducati-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":879217,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Price:</strong> $8,495-$9,995<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 803cc V-twin   <br>                \t\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed sequential manual<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> USB socket for a smartphone<br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Soft saddlebags with Scrambler logo<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Antilock brakes, LED headlamp and taillamp, electronic fuel injection<br>\n<strong>Notable options:</strong> Interchangeable gas tank side panels, accessory headlamp trim ring, handlebar cross brace, dry-weather and waterproof side and tank bags\n <br>\n<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>After smoldering for forty years, the embers of a unique motorcycling passion</strong> have finally rekindled flames with the introduction of the 2015 Ducati Scrambler.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Lightweight and inexpensive, the Scrambler revives a model produced from 1962 to 1975, a Ducati street bike modified for “scrambles” races on off-road circuits.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"And indeed, as I found during the Scrambler’s press introduction in Palm Springs, California, it delivers the elemental riding experience.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-10T06:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"k900-promolarge","title":"K900 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91262501/k900-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":91262501,"fileName":"k900-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-10T06:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"k900-promolarge","title":"K900 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91262501/k900-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":91262501,"fileName":"k900-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-10T06:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"k900-header","title":"K900 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91262525/k900-header.jpg","fileMasterId":91262525,"fileName":"k900-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":914413,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, rear-wheel-drive sedan<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $60,400 (including destination)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $66,400 (including destination)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 5.0-liter V-8, 420 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Eight-speed automatic; Drive Mode Select with Sport, Normal, Comfort, and Snow settings <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 15 mpg city/23 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Heated steering wheel<br>     \n<strong>Options I can’t live without:</strong> Power reclining rear seats<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Lexicon 17-speaker surround sound, heated front and rear seats<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Head-up display<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> 2015 Lexus LS460 ($73,445), 2015 Cadillac CTS ($46,340), 2015 Infiniti Q70 ($50,755), 2015 Acura RLX ($49,370)  (prices include destination)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Hello, America: Kia makes luxury cars.</strong> Forget your preconceived notion that Kia produces entry-level sedans and boxy SUVs.

For example, with its rear seatbacks up, the Golf’s cargo space is almost 23 cubic feet, whereas the trunk of a Volkswagen Jetta, the Golf’s structural cousin, is less than 16 cubic feet. Fold the Golf’s rear seatbacks forward, and capacity increases to almost 53 cubic feet—room enough for a couple of weeks of groceries, a mountain bike or two, and a big flat-screen TV.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"Also, the R’s performance doesn’t extract a big fuel economy penalty.

With a base price of $37,415, the R costs about $6,000 more than a GTI. Choose the Golf R with DCC & Navigation, and the price gets perilously close to $40,000.

If it’s strong, the Golf R offers a very compelling proposition, a super hot hatchback with few rivals, mainly its cousin once removed, the Audi S3, and the upcoming 2016 Ford Focus RS.<br>\n<br>\nBut if that need is only moderate, the GTI delivers plenty of driver gratification, and it's kinder to your

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Lunacy","id":1034778,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-lunacy","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-16T19:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"what-i-drove-promolarge","title":"What I Drove Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87621732/what-i-drove-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":87621732,"fileName":"what-i-drove-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-16T19:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"what-i-drove-promolarge","title":"What I Drove Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87621732/what-i-drove-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":87621732,"fileName":"what-i-drove-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-16T19:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"what-i-drove-header","title":"What I Drove Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/93020675/what-i-drove-header.jpg","fileMasterId":93020675,"fileName":"what-i-drove-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":924744,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"What I Drove 14","caption":"","fileMasterId":93020672,"fileName":"what-i-drove-14.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/93020672/what-i-drove-14.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>Snow has not been kind to our efforts of late,</strong> but save your sympathy for the Northeast.

I grew up in a mixed family. We always had a brand-new car, but we also had a fleet of used cars. The variety of vehicles is an integral part of my memory.

Your self-worth should never be defined by the car you drive.</strong> I am confused by families that own two spanking-new vehicles. I wonder if the new-car smell is even gone when they head to the dealer to replenish their stock. The reasons most often given for always buying new (including by Laura, below) are the fear of breaking down and the unknown cost of repairs. Few admit it is because they worry what their neighbors would think if they were seen in an older vehicle. If that's what is really going on, reconsider.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<strong>2. You should value your hard-earned money.</strong> If you do the research on a vehicle up front and then have a complete inspection, the extra dollars in your bank account may be worth the risk of buying a used car.

A high percentage of buyers reduce the car purchase to the monthly payment and glaze over when it comes to the length of time. They shouldn't. The math is crucial. It is important to sit down with a calculator and add up all of the costs of ownership, including insurance, before you go to the dealership and they start sprinkling their magic dust.

Unlike the 458, the 488’s V-8 is smaller—3.9 liters versus 4.5—and its nourishment is enriched by turbocharging, consistent with Ferrari’s commitment to force feeding in all future engines. As you’d expect, output increases substantially: 661 horsepower and 561 pound-feet of torque, versus 597 hp and 398 lb-ft for the 458 Speciale, the final edition of the 458 series. The 488 is a little bigger than the 458—1.5 inches longer, just over a half-inch wider—but it’s also a smidge lighter, with a 50 percent increase in aerodynamic downforce and decreased aerodynamic drag, according to Ferrari.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-03-12T08:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lexus-promolarge2","title":"Lexus Promolarge2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98368418/lexus-promolarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":98368418,"fileName":"lexus-promolarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-03-12T08:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lexus-promolarge2","title":"Lexus Promolarge2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98368418/lexus-promolarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":98368418,"fileName":"lexus-promolarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-03-12T08:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lexus-header2","title":"Lexus Header2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98368409/lexus-header2.jpg","fileMasterId":98368409,"fileName":"lexus-header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":927764,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2015 Lexus IS250</h3>\n<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, rear-wheel-drive sedan<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $37,475 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $41,150 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.5-liter V-6, 204 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed automatic with paddle shifters <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 21 mpg city/30 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Siri Eyes Free iPhone connection<br>\n<strong>Options I can’t live without:</strong> Navigation system ($1,855)<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Power tilting and sliding moonroof, dual chrome exhaust, drive mode select (Eco, Normal, Sport, Snow)<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Rearview camera, remote touch interface, voice command (part of Navigation package, $1,855)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> 2015 Audi A4 ($36,425), 2015 BMW 328i ($38,450), 2015 Cadillac ATS ($34,210) (prices include destination charges)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Lexus Promolarge","caption":"","fileMasterId":98368583,"fileName":"lexus-promolarge.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98368583/lexus-promolarge.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>The Lexus is in the American mindset as a go-to source for luxury vehicles.</strong> The brand has long been synonymous with elegance, and the brand’s quiet cabins have become a benchmark phrase: Lexus quiet.

Maintain Proper Tire Pressure</h3>\nOur expert friends at the<a href=\"http://www.tirerack.com/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Tire Rack,</a> the one-stop tire shopping website, tell us that proper tire pressure is the one thing that can help the most if you hit a pothole. If a tire is running low on air and you hit a pothole, you’re more likely to sustain damage because the rubber can get pinched between the pothole and the edge of the wheel. If it’s overinflated, it will be more unyielding and thus, more susceptible to surface damage. So, get a tire gauge and use it—or stop off at your local service station and check the air pressure frequently.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>2. Don’t Hit a Pothole in the First Place</h3>\nWatch the road even more carefully than usual this time of year. Slow down enough that you have time to avoid a pothole once you’ve spotted it.

Check for Tire Damage</h3>\r\nGet in the habit of checking your tires, says Tire Rack’s Matt Edmonds. That’s especially true after you have hit a pothole. If you’ve blown a tire completely, that will be obvious, but there can be harder-to-spot issues that can lead to a blowout later, or at least will greatly reduce tire life.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"Don’t just check the part of your tire you can see; stop in to your favorite repair spot and get the inside shoulder of the tire looked at, too. If there are bulges or bumps—something that looks like a blister, Edmonds says—it probably means you’ve cut the tire’s interliner, which means air can get between it and the rest of the tire. To know for sure, you have to have someone demount the tire from the wheel. If you spot a blister, mark it with chalk, because once the air has been let out of the tire, you won’t be able to see it anymore.

As Edmonds points out, we’re all more likely to put extra loads on our vehicles during the vacation months—whether towing boats and Jet Skis or just loading up luggage for a road trip—and a tire weakened by pothole damage may not be able to stand up to that stress.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

One is eAssist, which uses an electric motor and current from a small lithium-ion battery to boost the 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine—a so-called mild hybrid system, yielding 36 mpg on the highway. On the other hand, you can go for the strong push in the back that everybody likes when dashing onto the freeway or around a slower vehicle. So the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder generates 259 horsepower and a formidable 295 pound-feet of torque. To get that one, order the Regal GS with all-wheel drive. A record winter really wouldn’t pose such a big obstacle. And even though this hardware creates the slowest Regal, the AWD version still covers 0 to 60 mph in 6.8 seconds. Not bad! <br>Beyond the advanced drivetrain, the Regal offers a comfortable and rather plush cabin with dual-zone climate system, eight-inch touchscreen, and heated front seats, all standard. The standard and available safety systems make for a secure environment, although the smaller Verano actually has more air bags, if you like that sort of thing. And then there’s the infotainment system that supports up to ten devices and reads incoming text messages over the audio speakers. When we hear the name Regal, we still think of velour upholstery and Donna Summer playing on the radio. You can still get the latter—maybe streaming wirelessly through an app is the most immediate way—but otherwise the 2015 Regal reflects just how much tastes have changed since those velour days.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nOnStar with 4G LTE and standard WiFi hots pot, three new exterior

But the 500 is a darling little bulb-shaped thing, whereas the 500L is more bulbous. It's Fiat's attempt to update the tidy little 500 Giardiniera station wagon introduced in 1960, and it does benefit from Fiat’s innovative approach to design. The available white- or black-painted roof seems to float. Easy, Pop, and Lounge trim groups differentiate the 500L by lifestyle. The newest addition is the Trekking trim group, which suggests adventure in the way that the original Subaru Legacy Outback did. The Trekking has seventeen-inch wheels, unique rugged-looking front and rear fascia designs, flared fenders, and a black-and-brown interior. Fiat has also introduced a 500X crossover SUV, which is more of a legitimate waffle stomper.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nTrekking trim level, conventional six-speed automatic joins manual and dual-clutch transmissions.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Fiat 500L interior","fileMasterId":103955876,"fileName":"fiat-500L-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103955876/fiat-500L-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Fiat 500L","fileMasterId":103955873,"fileName":"fiat-500L-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103955873/fiat-500L-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Fiat 500L","fileMasterId":103955870,"fileName":"fiat-500L-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103955870/fiat-500L-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Fiat 500L</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/2014-fiat-500l-easy/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2014 Fiat 500L Easy</a> December 19, 2013","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43596,"make":"Fiat","model":"500","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"71d39f07-0bc5-39bd-9468-12085dc13b7c","type":"mediaTag","name":"First_Car","path":"/Main/First_Car"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:02.700-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547702700 }} },{ "_id":673941,"title":"2015 Toyota Camry","subTitle":"A perennial favorite remade.","slug":"2015-toyota-camry","promoTitle":"2015 Toyota Camry","promoTeaserSmall":"A perennial favorite remade.","promoTeaser":"A perennial favorite remade.","keywords":["2015 Toyota Camry"],"metaTitle":"2015 Toyota Camry","metaKeywords":["2015 Toyota Camry; Toyota; Japanese; sedan"],"metaDescription":"A perennial favorite remade.

Toyota promises a quieter cabin as well with revised door seals, 30 percent more noise insulating material in the carpet, and more aerodynamic side mirrors to reduce wind noise. Several iterations of Toyota’s multimedia system, Entune, are available across the model line with either a 6.1-or 7.0-inch touchscreen. A new sportier model, XSE, adds eighteen-inch wheels and unique suspension tuning to the SE trim. The XLE model comes standard with leather and offers a Select package with premium audio, navigation, and connectivity functions as well as safety aids like blind spot monitoring.

While it’s grown larger, it’s also become more stylish with a subtly sculpted exterior and an attractive, smartly organized interior. Despite it’s more polished look, the RAV4 still excels as a cargo carrier. It can swallow more than 37 cubic feet of gear behind its third row and more than 70 with its third- and second-row seats folded. It can be also be optioned with all wheel drive. Three trims are available. The base LE comes standard with an array of comfort and safety features, the only option being roof rails. The XLE includes the rails, a moonroof, five-spoke seventeen-inch alloy wheels, and adds HD radio and traffic to infotainment system, Entune. A two-tone terracotta and black interior adds a little flair on the Limited edition. Not quite as luxurious as the name Limited implies, it does add leather trim on steering wheel shifter, a height-adjustable power liftgate, and eighteen-inch alloy wheels. The Limited also can be optioned with driving aids like blind spot warning, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert, and lane departure warning. Every trim includes a backup camera, Toyota’s Star Safety system that improves brake reaction, traction, and stability, as well as two 12-volt power outlets. And for days when you are have to squeeze that oversized science project to school, you’ll appreciate a second row that folds completely flat. The RAV4 proves you don’t have to be surrounded by leather and wood to feel well taken care of.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nEighteen-inch wheels with black painted pockets and pearl white exterior paint are part of the new Blizzard Pearl Premium Package, available on the Limited trim only.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota RAV4 interior","fileMasterId":103933640,"fileName":"toyota-rav4-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103933640/toyota-rav4-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota RAV4","fileMasterId":103933592,"fileName":"toyota-rav4-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103933592/toyota-rav4-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota RAV4","fileMasterId":103933589,"fileName":"toyota-rav4-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103933589/toyota-rav4-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45486,"make":"Toyota","model":"RAV4","year":2015},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:03.319-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547703320 }} },{ "_id":673956,"title":"2015 Toyota Tacoma","subTitle":"A compact pickup done right.","slug":"2015-toyota-tacoma","promoTitle":"2015 Toyota Tacoma","promoTeaserSmall":"A compact pickup done right.","promoTeaser":"A compact pickup done right.","keywords":["2015 Toyota Tacoma"],"metaTitle":"2015 Toyota Tacoma","metaKeywords":["2015 Toyota Tacoma; Toyota; pickup; truck; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"A compact pickup done right.

Redesigned head- and taillights and an aggressive black grille give the diminutive hatchback—offered in both three- and five-door bodystyles—a sportier look. The interior received a thorough restyle as well with upgraded seats—a six-way-adjustable driver’s seat is standard—soft-touch materials on the front doors and instrument panel, and a new gauge cluster. Toyota took steps to reduce road noise from entering the cabin by using acoustic windshield glass and adding more sound deadening materials throughout the cabin. The Yaris grew by two inches overall as well and a wider track, a retuned suspension, and a more rigid structure should help improve the Yaris’s stability and handling. A first for Yaris is the option of a dealer installed navigation system. Black trim on the headlights and wheels dress up the top-of-the-line SE. In fact, all the Yaris models are looking sharper thanks to the work of Toyota’s ED2 studio located in the South of France. Seems like the little Yaris is growing up but thankfully the price tag still remains in its teens.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nA makeover that includes a wider trapezoid grille, new fog, head- and taillights, nicer interior materials, and increased sound deadening in the cabin.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Yaris interior","fileMasterId":103928156,"fileName":"toyota-yaris-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103928156/toyota-yaris-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Yaris","fileMasterId":103928258,"fileName":"toyota-yaris-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103928258/toyota-yaris-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Yaris","fileMasterId":103928153,"fileName":"toyota-yaris-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103928153/toyota-yaris-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Yaris","fileMasterId":103928249,"fileName":"toyota-yaris-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103928249/toyota-yaris-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":44947,"make":"Toyota","model":"Yaris","year":2015},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:03.987-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547703988 }} },{ "_id":673967,"title":"2015 Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4","subTitle":"King bull.","slug":"2015-lamborghini-aventador-lp-700-4","promoTitle":"2015 Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4","promoTeaserSmall":"King bull.","promoTeaser":"King bull.","keywords":["2015 Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4"],"metaTitle":"2015 Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4","metaKeywords":["2015 Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4; Lamborghini; sports car; supercar; Italian"],"metaDescription":"King bull.

You are outrageous. So is the Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4. This supercar powered by a V-12 engine overstates itself. From the menace in its eyes to the flippancy of its LED taillamps, it displays contempt for the mundane vessels that carry people to and fro in daily life. The Aventador, named for a famous Spanish fighting bull, not only looks as though it could slice you in half but also like it wants to. With 691 horsepower on tap, it begs for a deserted road or a racetrack, and upon reaching one, it bellows. No apologies, no compromises. The seven-speed semi-automatic transmission is ruthless, and the all-wheel drive system doesn’t have in mind the task of bringing golden retriever puppies to the vet on a snowy morn—it’s all about achieving maximum grip when exiting a corner on track day. Of course there are niceties and conveniences inside the cabin, but the two-way power-adjustable front seats and four-speaker sound system tell you the Aventador isn’t about gadgetry. It’s a serious place of business, as the scowling face already made absolutely clear.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nThe even more expensive LP 750-4 Superveloce was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Lamborghini Aventador","fileMasterId":103926908,"fileName":"lamborghini-aventador-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103926908/lamborghini-aventador-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45709,"make":"Lamborghini","model":"Aventador","year":2015},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:04.210-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547704211 }} },{ "_id":673982,"title":"2016 Kia Optima","subTitle":"The tiger-nose grille continues on a new version of the stylish sedan.","slug":"2016-kia-optima","promoTitle":"2016 Kia Optima","promoTeaserSmall":"The tiger-nose grille continues on a new version of the stylish sedan.","promoTeaser":"The tiger-nose grille continues on a new version of the stylish sedan.","keywords":["2016 Kia Optima"],"metaTitle":"2016 Kia Optima -

We find it nicely balanced, entertaining to drive, precise feeling, and a good value. The four is of an opposed-cylinder design—a boxer engine—so it brings the center of gravity down low, which helps the handling. Steering is quick, and the limited-slip differential helps the rear wheels to always find the most available traction. This year the front suspension has been made more rigid and the rear shock absorbers are retuned, resulting in even less body roll. <br><br>Another improvement for the 2015 FR-S is found in the headlamps, which automatically turn themselves on and off. Inside the cabin, fake carbon-fiber trim now adorns the instrument panel. The FR-S is aimed at younger buyers, so the all-important standard audio system is a good one: eight speakers, a 6.1-inch touchscreen, HD radio, and auxiliary and USB inputs (in addition to Bluetooth connectivity).

The Golf is slightly larger, more aerodynamically efficient, and has a bolder look. Choose from turbocharged gasoline or diesel engines or the e-Golf’s battery-powered electric drive. The value-priced Golf Launch Edition comes with a 5.8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, Bluetooth connectivity, satellite radio, and an iPod interface. Post-collision braking, which minimizes the effect of a second impact, is also standard. The GTI has a 210-horsepower, four-cylinder engine under the hood and jaunty plaid upholstery and bright trim inside the cabin. The TDI has a quiet new turbo-diesel, direct-injection 2.0-liter four-cylinder that makes 150 horsepower and an impressive 236 pound-feet of torque. For the most demanding enthusiast drivers, the 292-horsepower Golf R rips from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.9 seconds and puts down the power with all-wheel drive. LED accents and a scowling face indicate the R’s serious intent, which is emphasized by the four exhaust outlets the R displays as it passes. Built on the same assembly line in sequence with all other Golf models, the fully electric e-Golf visually separates itself with energy-efficient LED headlamps and unique wheels and badges. It uses battery power and three driving modes to cover as many as 83 miles on a single charge. There are also three braking modes to generate current on the go.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nAn all-new model","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volkswagen Golf/GTI interior","fileMasterId":103906445,"fileName":"volkswagen-golf-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103906445/volkswagen-golf-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volkswagen Golf/GTI","fileMasterId":103906283,"fileName":"volkswagen-golf-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103906283/volkswagen-golf-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volkswagen Golf/GTI","fileMasterId":103906442,"fileName":"volkswagen-golf-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103906442/volkswagen-golf-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":42464,"make":"Volkswagen","model":"Jetta","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":48783,"make":"Volkswagen","model":"Jetta Hybrid","year":2015},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:10.014-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547710015 }} },{ "_id":678704,"title":"2015 Volkswagen Jetta","subTitle":"Nipped and tucked.","slug":"2015-volkswagen-jetta","promoTitle":"2015 Volkswagen Jetta","promoTeaserSmall":"Nipped and tucked.","promoTeaser":"Nipped and tucked.","keywords":["2015 Volkswagen Jetta"],"metaTitle":"2015 Volkswagen Jetta","metaKeywords":["2015 Volkswagen Jetta; Volkswagen; VW; sedan; wagon; German"],"metaDescription":"Nipped and tucked.

Designers have created a new face with a different grille and three horizontal fins, similar to the Passat. An available lighting package adds HID headlamps with LED running lights, trimmed by touches of chrome. Aerodynamic efficiency improvement was also a priority, and the new bumper advances this cause. The Jetta 1.8T and TDI have an active shutter in the grille for even less drag and better thermal efficiency. For the value-conscious buyer, the Jetta lineup starts with the 2.0L S with a generous assortment of standard features. This year’s Jetta Sport is a value-package with SE trim and includes the turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, a sport suspension and seats, two-tone 17-inch wheels, fog lamps, and navigation with a rearview camera. It’s offered with five-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. The GLI has 18-inch wheels, a honeycomb grille, LED tail lamps and dual-outlet exhaust; its turbocharged 2.0-liter four produces 210 horsepower. Extreme measures for the lowest drag give the Jetta Hybrid—one of the best of its type that we’ve driven—its own face, and the turbocharged 1.4-liter teams with electric drive for a performance advantage against hybrid competitors. Not receiving the sedan’s revisions, the Jetta SportWagen carries over as 2014.5 model and keeps the 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nNew front and rear styling.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volkswagen Jetta interior","fileMasterId":103903751,"fileName":"volkswagen-jetta-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103903751/volkswagen-jetta-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volkswagen Jetta","fileMasterId":103903838,"fileName":"volkswagen-jetta-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103903838/volkswagen-jetta-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volkswagen Jetta","fileMasterId":103903748,"fileName":"volkswagen-jetta-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103903748/volkswagen-jetta-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":42464,"make":"Volkswagen","model":"Jetta","year":2015},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:10.253-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547710254 }} },{ "_id":678705,"title":"2015 Volkswagen Passat","subTitle":"Midsize premium.","slug":"2015-volkswagen-passat","promoTitle":"2015 Volkswagen Passat","promoTeaserSmall":"Midsize premium.","promoTeaser":"Midsize premium.","keywords":["2015 Volkswagen Passat"],"metaTitle":"2015 Volkswagen Passat","metaKeywords":["2015 Volkswagen Passat; Volkswagen; VW; sedan; German"],"metaDescription":"Midsize premium.

The feat was achieved with the new turbo-diesel direct-injection 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. Along with generating 150 horsepower and an impressive 236 pound-feet of torque, this engine provides excellent throttle response and operates smoothly. With the six-speed manual transmission it provides a cruising range of up to 814 miles. A six-speed dual-clutch automatic is also available in the TDI. For value, check out the Passat Wolfsburg Edition. It adopts all the standard features of the 1.8T S and adds a six-speed automatic transmission, unique wheels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and heated front seats. The Wolfsburg Edition also has satellite radio and an iPod hookup. The V-6 Passat has a long list of standard features including rain-sensing wipers, a sunroof, premium touchscreen infotainment with navigation, and a rearview camera. The spacious, tastefully appointed cabin has just the right amount of bright ornamentation; the leather-trimmed seats with micro-fabric inserts are supremely comfortable. In its top trim, the 3.6-liter V-6 model is outfitted with a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, which provides rapid-fire gear changes.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-09T08:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"vochitos-promolarge2","title":"Vochitos Promolarge2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/104490326/vochitos-promolarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":104490326,"fileName":"vochitos-promolarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":780},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1600}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-09T08:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"vochitos-promolarge2","title":"Vochitos Promolarge2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/104490326/vochitos-promolarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":104490326,"fileName":"vochitos-promolarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":780},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1600}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-09T08:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"vochitos-header","title":"Vochitos Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/104490320/vochitos-header.jpg","fileMasterId":104490320,"fileName":"vochitos-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1011},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1590}}},"pages":[{"id":934698,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Do you know the Vochitos of Mexico?

At the same time, the car got an improved infotainment system with an 8.8-inch display, and semi-surround-view cameras were added. Additionally, the eight-speed automatic transmission was fitted into the drivetrain. In addition to the Phantom sedan, there’s an extended-wheelbase version for limo duties. Meanwhile, built on a shorter version of the sedan’s chassis, the Phantom Coupe is available with the Starlight headliner. The Phantom Drophead Coupe—we Americans say convertible—has a lined fabric top and optional teak deck.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

The new sporty Escape distinguished itself quickly in the very crowded small sport-ute segment with a unique look and a variety of upscale features. When you slide into the driver’s seat, the small-truck heritage of the Escape is nowhere to be found. The cabin is attractive and comfortable, and the controls are easy to reach and decipher. The Escape can be had in three trims: S, SE, and Titanium. The base S trim can only be equipped with the 168-horsepower 2.5-liter four-cylinder and front-wheel drive. The SE can be had with any of the three available engines, with front- or four-wheel drive, and with an options package that includes features such as a dual-zone automatic climate control and a backup warning system. <br><br>At the top of the Escape heap is the Titanium trim. It’s loaded up with premium touches, comes in front- or all-wheel-drive, and offers a choice between two turbocharged EcoBoost engines. That power will come in handy if you opt for the tow package that enables the Escape to pull up to 3,500 pounds. The hatch can swallow a respectable 34 cubic feet of stuff; that number doubles with the rear seats folded. Optionally, the adjustable, hands-free liftgate—it opens with a kick of your foot under the rear bumper—makes loading cargo a cinch. Like many Ford models, the Escape can be optioned with park assist, a system that takes control of the steering to help you parallel park, drama free.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nMagnetic Metallic grey exterior paint","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Escape interior","fileMasterId":106515263,"fileName":"ford-escape-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106515263/ford-escape-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Escape","fileMasterId":106515257,"fileName":"ford-escape-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106515257/ford-escape-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Escape","fileMasterId":106515251,"fileName":"ford-escape-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106515251/ford-escape-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":6},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:14.086-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547714087 }} },{ "_id":679256,"title":"2015 Ford Expedition","subTitle":"Supersize utility for the whole family.","slug":"2015-ford-expedition","promoTitle":"2015 Ford Expedition","promoTeaserSmall":"Supersize utility for the whole family.","promoTeaser":"Supersize utility for the whole family.","keywords":["2015 Ford Expedition"],"metaTitle":"2015 Ford Expedition","metaKeywords":["2015 Ford Expedition; Ford; SUV; sport-utility; American"],"metaDescription":"2015 Ford Expedition: Supersize utility for the whole family.

The third row folds flat; a power-operated third row is optional on the XLT, standard on the remaining trims. The second row slides forward for easier access. Four trims are available, and each available with rear- or four-wheel drive. The entry-level XLT is equipped with standards like a leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel, a 4.2-inch display with USB connectivity, and a radar-based backup warning system. Limited buyers will enjoy the perforated leather seats and a power liftgate. The King Ranch version of the Expedition has a Southwest color palate for the perforated leather-trimmed seats—the front are heated and ventilated, while those in the second row are heated—and gets such niceties as remote start, power-deployable running boards, and an eight-inch touchscreen infotainment display. When optioned with the heavy-duty trailer package, the Expedition can tow up to 9,200 pounds, depending on the drivetrain. Select from three driving modes (Comfort, Normal, and Sport) that alter the suspension for a customized ride, and enjoy all that the new Expedition has to offer.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nThe 3.5-liter turbocharged V-6, a refreshed front end, more available features, and the Platinum trim level.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Expedition interior","fileMasterId":106516985,"fileName":"ford-expedition-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106516985/ford-expedition-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Expedition","fileMasterId":106516982,"fileName":"ford-expedition-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106516982/ford-expedition-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Expedition","fileMasterId":106516979,"fileName":"ford-expedition-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106516979/ford-expedition-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"SUVs","classGroup":"SUV","color":"","id":41278,"make":"Ford","model":"Expedition","year":2015},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":7},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:14.312-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547714312 }} },{ "_id":679257,"title":"2015 Ford Explorer","subTitle":"Tried-and-true SUV classic.","slug":"2015-ford-explorer","promoTitle":"2015 Ford Explorer","promoTeaserSmall":"Tried-and-true SUV classic.","promoTeaser":"Tried-and-true SUV classic.","keywords":["2015 Ford Explorer"],"metaTitle":"2015 Ford Explorer","metaKeywords":["2015 Ford Explorer; Ford; SUV; sport-utility; crossover; American"],"metaDescription":"Tried-and-true SUV classic.

With loads of options for comfort, utility, and safety, it's no surprise that the Explorer continues to be popular with active families.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nAn optional appearance package for the XLT trim, and three fresh exterior colors choices: Bronze Fire Metallic, Caribou Metallic, and Magnetic Metallic.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Explorer interior","fileMasterId":106518314,"fileName":"ford-explorer-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106518314/ford-explorer-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Explorer","fileMasterId":106518311,"fileName":"ford-explorer-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106518311/ford-explorer-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Explorer","fileMasterId":106518308,"fileName":"ford-explorer-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106518308/ford-explorer-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Ford Explorer</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround/2016-ford-explorer/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2016 Ford Explorer: Walkaround</a> January 6, 2015 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/on-the-road/ford-explorer-rolling/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2014 Ford Explorer Rolling in the D</a> October 31, 2013","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"SUVs","classGroup":"SUV","color":"","id":42638,"make":"Ford","model":"Explorer","year":2015},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":12},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:14.580-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547714587 }} },{ "_id":679263,"title":"2015 Ford F-Series Super Duty","subTitle":"Ready for serious work.","slug":"2015-ford-f-series-super-duty","promoTitle":"2015 Ford F-Series Super Duty","promoTeaserSmall":"Ready for serious work.","promoTeaser":"Ready for serious work.","keywords":["2015 Ford F-Series Super Duty"],"metaTitle":"2015 Ford F-Series Super Duty","metaKeywords":["2015 Ford F-series Super Duty; pickup; truck; American"],"metaDescription":"2015 Ford F-Series Super Duty: Ready for serious work.

The Lariat and King Ranch sit in the middle and give a nod to Southwest styling, particularly the King Ranch with its Mesa brown interior trim. The Platinum level offers every conceivable convenience like a high-definition touchscreen display for use with the Sync system that includes navigation and infotainment. Style and safety upgrades include walnut wood dash accents and a heated steering wheel, as well as brake enhancements for trailer control and power-adjustable pedals. There are two available V-8 engines: a 6.2-liter gasoline unit with flex-fuel capability and a turbo-diesel with a hefty 860 pound-feet of torque. For 2015, the turbo-diesel receives a bump in horsepower, now up to 440 hp. All that oomph will surely be called upon when towing up to the maximum of 31,200 pounds. Rear- or four-wheel-drive models are available in three generous cabin sizes. Store your files in a handy armrest compartment or lift the back seat in the CrewCab or SuperCab to hide away larger valuable items. No matter what your industry, the Super Duty series has what it takes to become your all-terrain field office.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nTurbo-diesel V-8 engine gets 40 more horsepower","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford F-series Super Duty","fileMasterId":106519994,"fileName":"ford-fseriessuperduty-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106519994/ford-fseriessuperduty-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford F-series Super Duty","fileMasterId":106519991,"fileName":"ford-fseriessuperduty-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106519991/ford-fseriessuperduty-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford F-series Super Duty","fileMasterId":106519988,"fileName":"ford-fseriessuperduty-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106519988/ford-fseriessuperduty-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":38426,"make":"Ford","model":"F-350","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":38425,"make":"Ford","model":"F-250","year":2015},{"id":"8bfe9141-264d-3530-adde-b612c376b580","type":"mediaTag","name":"Trucks","path":"/Main/Trucks"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:14.829-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547714829 }} },{ "_id":679265,"title":"2015 Ford Fiesta","subTitle":"Feisty and fun.","slug":"2015-ford-fiesta","promoTitle":"2015 Ford Fiesta","promoTeaserSmall":"Feisty and fun.","promoTeaser":"Feisty and fun.","keywords":["2015 Ford Fiesta"],"metaTitle":"2015 Ford Fiesta","metaKeywords":["2015 Ford Fiesta; Ford; sedan; hatchback; American"],"metaDescription":"2015 Ford Fiesta: Feisty and fun.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-20T10:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lexus-rc350-fsport-promolarge","title":"Lexus Rc350 Fsport Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/108801782/lexus-rc350-fsport-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":108801782,"fileName":"lexus-rc350-fsport-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-20T10:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lexus-rc350-fsport-promolarge","title":"Lexus Rc350 Fsport Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/108801782/lexus-rc350-fsport-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":108801782,"fileName":"lexus-rc350-fsport-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-20T10:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lexus-rc350-fsport-header","title":"Lexus Rc350 Fsport Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/108801881/lexus-rc350-fsport-header.jpg","fileMasterId":108801881,"fileName":"lexus-rc350-fsport-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":935857,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2015 Lexus RC350 F Sport</h3>\n<strong>Type:</strong> 2+2-passenger, rear-wheel-drive sport coupe<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $43,715 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $54,720 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.5-liter V-6, 308 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Eight-speed automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 19 mpg city/28 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> <br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Drive mode select (Eco, Normal, Sport, Snow); eighteen-inch aluminum wheels; LED headlamps and daytime running lights; dual chrome exhaust; wood trim; Lexus premium audio<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> F Sport package ($3,985), includes F Sport bumper and spindle grille, 19-inch wheels, blind spot monitor, rear cross-traffic alert, ventilated F Sport seats, perforated leather steering wheel and shift knob, aluminum pedals, and adaptive variable suspension with Sport S+ mode; variable-gear-ratio steering ($1,900); moonroof ($1,100); park assist ($500); dynamic radar cruise control with pre-collision system ($500)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> 2015 Audi A5 Coupe Premium ($42,125); 2015 BMW 428i ($41,700); 2015 Mercedes-Benz C350 Coupe ($44,975) (all prices include destination charges) \n<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Lexus Rc350 Fsport 07","caption":"","fileMasterId":108801686,"fileName":"lexus-rc350-fsport-07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/108801686/lexus-rc350-fsport-07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Holy Hellzapoppin!
