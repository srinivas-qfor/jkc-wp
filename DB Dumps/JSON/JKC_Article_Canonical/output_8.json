The ATS is a luxury performance sedan at heart, with standard rear-wheel drive and an available 321-horsepower V-6 engine. Cadillac is hoping that the ATS will draw new, younger buyers to the brand, which suffers from an aging demographic. I’m normally turned off by Cadillac’s boxy, angular design language, but the ATS caught my attention, so I took one for a drive to see if it would change my mind.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"The ATS I tested was a Premium model, with standard leather seats, an eight-inch touchscreen with Cadillac’s CUE infotainment interface, and magnesium paddle shifters. Our test car also included a $1,050 power sunroof; the Driver Awareness package, which includes lane departure warning and front collision alert; and the $600 Cold Weather package, which gets you heated front seats and a heated steering wheel.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"dogs in hot cars","caption":"","fileMasterId":54718344,"fileName":"cadillac_ats08.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54718344/cadillac_ats08.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":3,"text":"The ATS’s striking exterior, with its long, teardrop-shaped headlights and tight angles, is a perfect companion to the sleek, luxurious interior. The ATS is the smallest Cadillac, so it’s not exactly spacious, but it’s not unacceptably cramped, either. The ATS I tested had a Morello Red interior, a pleasant burgundy shade reminiscent of red wine, contrasted with black trim.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2013 Cadillac ATS","caption":"","fileMasterId":54724698,"fileName":"Interior_Caddy.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54724698/Interior_Caddy.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":349},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":4,"text":"The standard CUE infotainment system was somewhat less pleasing. I appreciated the clear, legible display, but found the system drawing my attention away from the road for tasks as simple as changing the radio station. The physical buttons for climate and volume control weren’t as consistently responsive as one might hope. The standard head-up display, which projects vehicle speed and navigation information onto the windshield, was an interesting and helpful touch that helped make up for CUE’s shortcomings.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"The 3.6-liter, 321-horsepower V-6 engine makes the ATS genuinely enjoyable to drive. Our test car’s performance suspension, brakes, and precise steering gave the car a sporty feel. The V-6 isn’t available with a manual transmission, but the automatic transmission has a manual shift mode and optional paddle shifters that can give you a measure of control over the driving experience. When shifting manually, the transmission automatically rev matches on downshifts, producing an exhaust burp that is strangely gratifying despite the risk of making other drivers roll their eyes.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"dogs in hot cars","caption":"","fileMasterId":50718988,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_10.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50718988/cadillac_ats_10.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":6,"text":"<h3>The Verdict:</h3>\nI’m still not totally sold on Cadillac’s design language, but I am attracted to the ATS’s dynamic exterior and slightly softer lines in spite of myself. The interior is attractive and luxurious without losing its sporty attitude. I think Cadillac has accomplished its goal of creating a car that will catch the eye of a younger buyer. To me, the V-6 engine and performance features are what make this car. I’m not sure how I would feel about the significantly less powerful 2.5-liter, 202-horsepower base engine, for instance.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"Yes, $49,735 seems like a lot of money to spend on a small sedan, even one as loaded as this.

I found it difficult to even turn up the volume on the stereo. I finally resorted to using the button on the steering wheel. The silver toned bars and buttons are aesthetically beautiful, but I would need much more time to really explore and understand all of the capabilities.

I love the two-tone leather in the car and the way the cockpit wraps around the driver and the passenger. I was most excited about the head-up display; it was nice not having to look down at the speedometer all the time. The only thing that would keep me from buying this car (besides the price) is the way it rides on rough roads. Performance suspension just isn't for me.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<strong>Scott:</strong> The head-up display is awesome. I love that feature. It makes me feel like RoboCop or Terminator. For me, navigating around a city, I don’t want to be looking around at the GPS. You don’t have to tilt your head; all you have to do is glance. As for the looks and the driving experience, I felt like I was inside a delicious red velvet cake. I like that it doesn’t look or feel like a boat anymore, which is how I remember my grandfather’s Cadillacs.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<strong>Laura:</strong> I recall running down the street as a kid to marvel at a brand-new Cadillac that somebody's dad or grandpa had just brought home, and watching in fascination as gewgaws and gadgets were explained and tried out. \"You just push THIS, and THIS happens!\" \"Wowwww!\" Commercials that show the ATS performing on the mountain roads of North Africa notwithstanding, I still see Cadillacs that way: a treat somebody gets for him- or herself later in life. Nothing wrong with that. What a pleasant experience, then, to see that this ATS has an interior color scheme, instrument panel trim, and display that are just as wild and different from the routine as ever. Because we're Americans! And that's what we do. Somewhere in middle Ohio, a new ATS owner is showing it off to the neighborhood kids. I hope their mouths are dropping open. They ought to be.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"<strong>Jean:</strong> If you like luxury, if you like a bit of edge and performance with your luxury, and if you like to buy American, then you should look at the ATS. The steering is a precise, finely tuned weapon, and the engine adds a little dramatic background noise. Shifts are better in manual mode, though still a tad lazy. Brakes are the best—Brembos—and the suspension damping is very refined, although it’s best at high speeds than lower. The space age interior controls, high-gloss carbon fiber trim, and iPad-like CUE navigation screen give the ATS a dash of techno that blends surprisingly well with the luxe leather. (I didn’t say I liked CUE, did I?) Altogether, it’s a cozy place to be, especially if you’re single.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"Annie White behind the wheel of the 2013 Cadillac ATS","fileMasterId":54718401,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54718401/cadillac_ats_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS","fileMasterId":54718344,"fileName":"cadillac_ats08.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54718344/cadillac_ats08.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS","fileMasterId":54718392,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54718392/cadillac_ats_07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS","fileMasterId":50718988,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_10.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50718988/cadillac_ats_10.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS interior","fileMasterId":54718320,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_09.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54718320/cadillac_ats_09.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS interior","fileMasterId":50718739,"fileName":"cadillac_ats03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50718739/cadillac_ats03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS interior","fileMasterId":50718736,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50718736/cadillac_ats_04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS interior","fileMasterId":54718395,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54718395/cadillac_ats_06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS detail","fileMasterId":50718733,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50718733/cadillac_ats_05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":8,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS detail","fileMasterId":54718350,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54718350/cadillac_ats_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":9,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":13,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":10},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:18:49.608-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546729610 }} },{ "_id":348074,"title":"2014 Honda Accord Plug-in","subTitle":"Quick charge time makes all the difference","slug":"2014-honda-accord-plug-in","promoTitle":"2014 Honda Accord Plug-in","promoTeaserSmall":"I drove this hybrid and was surprised how useful it was for everyday commuting.

The Plug-in is only for sale in California and New York, where emissions regulations mandate the sales of zero-emissions vehicles. The Fit EV has slightly wider availability, with cars available in Oregon and several East Coast states. The company hasn’t announced plans to expand sales beyond those markets.

","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"Making use of all that space wasn’t as easy as it should have been, since the Tahoe’s third-row seats don’t fold flat and must be removed and stored separately if you need a flat load floor. Luckily, once you’ve hauled the back seats away, a power-folding second row makes freeing up the rest of the space a breeze. If you’re still worried about space, don’t be. The all-wheel-drive Tahoe is rated to tow 7,300 pounds (the rear-wheel-drive version is rated to tow 7,100 pounds), so you can hook up a trailer to fit whatever doesn’t make it in the car itself.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"At 5,694 pounds, you can hardly blame the Tahoe for feeling large on the road.

That’s not bad for a car this size, and a twenty-six-gallon fuel tank means you can make it more than 400 miles between fill-ups. But that doesn’t stop the $80-plus trips to the gas station from feeling like a punch to the wallet—a big change from the $35 fill-ups I’ve grown accustomed to in my hatchback.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>The Verdict:</h3>\nThe Chevrolet Tahoe is not a car for city dwellers or people who need a big car for two weeks out of the year. It’s fairly expensive, a little unwieldy, and not efficient enough to make sense if you don’t genuinely need the hauling space. But if you do find yourself carting around a passel of kids (the Tahoe can be configured to seat nine) and their stuff frequently, it’s hard to imagine a car that would do it more comfortably than a nicely equipped Tahoe. The leather seats, infotainment and entertainment systems, and acres of space make it perfect for families, while the hefty tow rating gives it credibility as a utility vehicle.

Why not spend a few thousand more and get the Suburban? You only gain a couple of miles per gallon with the Tahoe, but you lose cargo space behind the third row. In order to make the Tahoe usable as a hauler, you really need to take the third row out. That being said, it is a solid vehicle that would be great for a road trip, but the interior is very bland and utilitarian.

In fact, a dirt road is the first place I wanted to drive it, and I was pleased with how comfortably it handled every bump. My dislikes were in the rear. I didn’t appreciate the high load-in height in back or the removable, but not stow-in-the-floor, third row of seats. I’d either buy a Chevrolet Suburban or a minivan if I wanted a vehicle this size.

After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-07-24T09:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"limited edition chevrolet sonic colors","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50934908/sonic-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":50934908,"fileName":"sonic-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-07-24T09:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"limited edition chevrolet sonic colors","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56021958/sonic-header.jpg","fileMasterId":56021958,"fileName":"sonic-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-07-24T09:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"limited edition chevrolet sonic colors","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/53673328/sonic-color-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":53673328,"fileName":"sonic-color-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":516140,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Choosing a color for your new car might be one of the best parts of the buying process.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

No matter which gender you’re driving, one of the kids will be rude and bossy, one will be the jokester, and one will be needy the whole time. Maybe some particularly gifted kid will combine two or more of those traits. (Maybe it will be your kid!) I so looked forward to the day I’d get a carload of girls with my daughter, after a few years of driving cars full of boys in her older brother’s class. (Example of boy behavior: I had to pull the car to the side of the road twice with fifth graders who wouldn’t stop screaming out the lyrics to “Air Force Ones” at ear-splitting volume.

We found ways to have fun together, and by the end, he was playing a little more with the others. What if I had rejected him and pushed him away as the other kids tended to do?

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Treating my son like a child and the car like a big toy would be sending him a clear message, and not one about behaving like an adult. In the real world where I live, buying a car involves a dozen or more financial skills, from budgeting to comparison shopping to negotiating.

","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>Lesson One: Sticker Shock</h3>\r\nSince Cole didn’t know how much the Mustang he coveted cost, we looked it up online. So his first lesson was sticker shock. Its starting price of $22,995 (including destination charge) was more than twice his highest guess. That reality check brought him right down to earth. In fact, it made him give up. So, at Baldwin’s suggestion, I offered to match dollar for dollar everything he could save, which would put a car—if not necessarily that car—within reach. “This makes it possible for him to buy a car without financing,” he explained. “But he will still have some skin in the game. And if he can’t afford much car, that’s his fault. But if he pulls together $10,000, you will have to have to match it. So be prepared.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Duly warned, I moved on to the next lesson.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>Teaching a Teen to Budget</h3>\r\n“Create a simple budget,” said Wahl. “Include up-front costs and costs that occur over time, such as gas, maintenance, and insurance. Be sure he shows his income and expenses.” Cole liked being treated like someone mature enough to have income and expenses—and the intelligence to manage them. And budgeting was well within his math skills. But he didn’t have a job. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"“Well, you need one to own a car.” I told him.

Much better, he said, that I teach him to buy what he can afford and avoid debt, which raises the long-term cost of the car and limits his future financial choices. “Financing teaches him that he can buy a car he can’t afford to impress people he doesn’t know,” he said. I agree—at least when it comes to financial planning. But I know my son. He will like the possibility of a fast solution. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"Wahl said:  “It’s important for him to understand that a loan helps you get what you want more quickly. But it comes at a cost. You can show him how big that cost is by using online loan calculators. Also show him how larger payments can reduce the cost of the loan over time.”   ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"<h3>Needs vs. Wants</h3>\r\nNow that we are talking about his own hard-earned money, the Mustang doesn’t appeal, at least not for a first car. In fact, his car of choice right now is “something I can afford.” But choosing a car is big part of the process. So we are having an ongoing conversation about how to do that well.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"“This is a great time to talk about needs and wants,” says Baldwin. “You may want a great car. But you probably don’t need it.” My fear is that Cole’s needs and wants might not be very mature. I’m sure he would choose fast and sexy over safe, whereas I would like him to live a long and happy life. But we will cross that bridge when we come to it. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"In addition to safety, we are exploring the long-term expenses. “Is there a difference in fuel economy and the total gas costs?” asked Wahl. “Is one model less expensive to maintain?” All important things to consider.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"<h3>Negotiating</h3>\r\nFor now, Cole is driving our old minivan and saving his money. But these car-fueled financial lessons are working. He has already gotten a job. And he has pushed off the financing decision until he has enough money for at least a sizable down payment. Meanwhile, he is hyper aware that every fast food meal and video game he buys is pushing his new car further into the future. When he is ready to buy, I will explain how to evaluate a used car and the art of negotiation. In fact, we might try negotiating on some smaller purchases in the interim.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"I suppose it would be fun to have a big child (and budget) so I could wrap a car up and hand my baby the keys.

With babies and toddlers in car seats, I'm betting you mostly play what <em>you</em> like to hear, and they're along for the ride. With tweens on up through the teen years, they're most likely plugged in to their own iPods or phones, listening to what <em>they</em> want to hear (and you probably would rather not).","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"That leaves a whole demographic that nobody's paying attention to, and they're mainly the ones I'm talking to you about today.

Here are my five secret strategies that I hope you'll make your own.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"left","altText":"car music for kids","caption":"","fileMasterId":57265642,"fileName":"musicwithkids_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57265642/musicwithkids_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":3,"text":"<h3>1. Know what you want your kids to hear.</h3> Don't be mindless about what you play. In my case, I wanted my kids to hear complex, gorgeous classical music. So I used to go to the library and check out cassettes, and later CDs. One memorable day, I maneuvered to have the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto in one hand and my three-year-old in the other. I waited for my moment: we had a twenty-five-mile drive to take, just the two of us. I put it on, and he ignored it and wriggled around in his seat...until it got to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKfdMR1WfNY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> part where the orchestra explodes. His eyes as big as saucers, he didn't move a muscle for the rest of the drive. I could see his brain cells expand at that very moment. These days, you have the whole YouTube/iTunes world of music at your disposal. Think it over, and choose wisely.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>2. Start low and gradually get louder.</h3> By this I mean, you can play almost anything if it's almost unnoticeable at first. I can't even overstress what a huge discovery that was for me, and it still works no matter how old my kids get. I used to be a Suzuki violin mom, meaning I had discs of violin music that my two violin student children were supposed to listen to a lot every day. If I put on the CD at normal volume, they might protest (the other two who were not studying violin protested loudest of all). But, I learned, if I put it on almost vanishingly softly, they wouldn't care, and I could slowly increase the volume until it reached loud. By that point, they were listening and usually liking it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>3. Make it into a treat, not a lecture.</h3> For instance, I waited till my three older children, then all between eight and ten, were in the car together. I announced, \"I'm going to play you one of my favorite songs. It has a murder in it. I think you're all big enough to handle it. Okay?\" Had their attention then! Guess what the song was? <a href=http://youtu.be/3p4MZJsexEs rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bohemian Rhapsody,</a> by Queen. I will never forget the looks on their faces as they took it in. They all still listen to Queen, years later. I also tried to get under-twelves interested in Bob Dylan. That one didn't take at first; I mainly remember their derisive laughter at his \"bad voice.\" I accepted that and didn't force the issue or lecture, and now my eighteen-year-old has virtually the whole Dylan catalog on his iPod. I have to think that presenting the music to him at a young age was a start, even if I didn't get instant gratification for it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>4. Tie in the music with other things you can do together.</h3> You could plan to take a child to a concert of someone you love to hear, or someone you want your kids to appreciate. I got Paul McCartney tickets for my eight-year-old, who had just started guitar lessons at the time. It was a surprise, but in the weeks before we went, I played a ton of vintage Beatles and McCartney music in the car. I didn't say anything about why. When we arrived at the Palace of Auburn Hills to hear Sir Paul, my boy already knew all the songs without being told he had to. You could also choose a theme, such as New Orleans jazz when you're going there on a family vacation, or songs in a language your kids are learning, or movie music in the week before the Oscars are on. The car is the place where you have the block of uninterrupted time with kids to build a theme like that.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>5. Have a sense of occasion.</h3> If you're going on a trip, why not make a road trip playlist? (Here are some of the <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/the-mix/labor-day-playlists/\" target=\"_blank\">Jean Knows Cars playlists</a> we just made, for inspiration.) I associate <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3plBzBB8LE8\" rel=\"nofollow\"\" target=\"_blank\">M.I.A.'s All I Wanna Do</a> with a drive to Vermont with my fourteen- and sixteen-year-old sons, because we had it on our playlist. Not like I am recommending that music, but it helped us bond, and when I appreciated that, they appreciated what I wanted to play, in that case <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvliMzAFWHM&feature=share&list=PL35720F32C815AFE1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Graceland,</a> by Paul Simon. What fun to roll out a \"Road Songs\" playlist for your kids next time you are driving somewhere for the weekend. Come on, you can think of some great songs your little kids need to hear that won't be on the radio or their iPods.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"You may not care if your children absorb Tchaikovsky (shame on you, though). But if you want your kids to grow up knowing and appreciating jazz, or Prince, or Leo Kottke, or Pink Floyd, they're not going to pick it up at elementary school. It's absolutely your job to insert it into their heads. In the car is the best place to do that. Bonus: The more you set the expectation that you will give your kids a great listening experience in the car, the fewer times you'll have to twist the dial to get away from \"Blurred Lines\" and One Direction.

The second year we took a Ford Flex, and this year, we drove the 2013 Cadillac SRX Premium.

But CUE is not as user friendly as the iPad, and since I am the type of person who needs everything immediately, it took about eight hours for me to figure out how to get a quick reaction from the screen. The vehicle was also equipped with OnStar, a voice-activated system that works for quick answers. \nPlaying with CUE took me through the swoopy hills of Pennsylvania.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-13T04:09:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 smart electric drive","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58912938/smart-fitness-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":58912938,"fileName":"smart-fitness-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-13T04:09:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 smart electric drive","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58913004/smart-fitness-header.jpg","fileMasterId":58913004,"fileName":"smart-fitness-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-13T04:09:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 smart electric drive","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58912938/smart-fitness-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":58912938,"fileName":"smart-fitness-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":542769,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Price:</strong> $30,290 as tested (includes destination charge) <br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Permanent-magnet AC electric motor, 74 horsepower, plus 17.6-kWh lithium-ion battery pack<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> One-speed direct drive automatic <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 122 MPGe city/93 MPGe highway<br>\n<strong>Driving range:</strong> 76 miles city/59 miles highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Interior styling, especially in Design Red<br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Technology package, includes Navigation and Surround Sound ($1,600)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Walking, taking the bus, biking, Chevrolet Volt, Ford Focus Electric, Nissan Leaf<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/6x7ABLc9CtI?list=UUKWoLlV8-sE8zQnoWHI9qoA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<em>Diminutive electric vehicle with two seats and a roomy trunk seeks companion.

So this coupe boasts eight airbags, a crash management system, and stability control. The passenger compartment is a steel safety cell that can withstand 9,000 pounds of force. In recently published crash test results on the 2013 Smart, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the Electric Drive four out of five stars in front crash and rollover testing, and five stars out of five in side crash testing. This honestly shocked me because I would have thought a side impact test would have been the Electric Drive’s Achilles' heel. The cabrio has not been tested, and it does come with two fewer airbags.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>Obstacle Number Two: Range</h4>\nIf you need to drive more than sixty-eight miles in a day, you can stop right here. Seriously, sixty-eight miles is the best-case scenario, and charging is slow. I know that when my iPhone’s battery is drained to zero, it frustrates me to wait the five minutes until I can make a call. The Electric Drive can be charged from any household socket but may require as much as fourteen hours to go from a zero charge to a full charge. A 240-volt Bosch Keba charging station will do the charging job in six hours. It's sold separately, by Bosch Service Solutions, and costs $1,322 plus installation, but your local utility company may offer incentives that will pay for some or all of that cost.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h4>Obstacle Number Three: Price</h4>\nThe pricing structure is a bit confusing because of tax incentives and a battery assurance program, but the Electric Drive is priced to move.

The added weight of the battery, and its location under the seats rather than too far fore or aft, helps stabilize this little whip. The cornering is tight, and seriously you can’t beat the turning radius. The acceleration is peppy, the top speed is 78 mph, and the 11.5-second 0-to-60-mph time would make the Lollipop Guild drop their lollipops. The handling is nimble, but because of the short wheelbase the ride can be a bit jarring. I was also concerned that it could really be dangerous to hit a large pothole. Assuming the Electric Drive will spend most of its life on city streets, the driving experience should meet most buyers' needs. But it can handle being with the big boys on the highway as well.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<h4>Obstacle Number Five: Availability</h4>\nIf you are still on board, you may have to wait for the opportunity to own this Smart.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.)

Within Trip A and Trip B, you can see your range: how many miles left on the tank of gas.

I searched high and low. No luck. I pulled out the abbreviated owner’s manual (the longer version now comes on CD). Apparently, most people must intuitively know how to open their gas tanks, because neither “gas” “gas tank,” nor “fuel” merit entry in the index. It was fifteen minutes of befuddlement, with a running monologue to myself: You have a Ph.D., and you can’t figure out how to open the f-ing gas tank to put fuel in your new Fiat?!?!

Fair to say that Sophia and I do not always understand each other.  I suppose if I consulted the owner’s manual about more than the location of the fuel tank button, Sophia and I could avoid having to go to counseling to reconcile our differences.

The daily schedule is rigorous, beginning at 6:45 a.m. reveille and calisthenics outside the rustic cabins next to Green Lake, and it goes straight through until cabin call at 9:00 p.m. To wander the campus is to hear a cacophonous blend of flute sonatas, piano concertos, vocal arias, and string quartets emanating from the practice studios, which really are huts set in the Michigan woods.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":26,"text":"Interlochen alumni speak of their experiences as transcendent and life changing.

Bursts of laughter were followed by a quivering lower lip and a small stream of tears, and a snippet of a tale would be shared.

She knew every note. Transported by the Italian and the moment, I began reminiscing about another memorable summer drive, following SS2 through the countryside of southern Tuscany, where olive groves give way to fields of sunflowers—<em>girasole</em> in Italian, which literally means “turn toward the sun.”  They are my favorite flower, perhaps because of the vivid association with the Italian landscape.

Directions for this element of Fiat ownership are not found in the owner’s manual.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":40,"text":"Then there is the routine questioning. It takes a little longer now to move about town. Not only do heads turn as I am driving down the streets of Ann Arbor, but strangers will stop me and ask, “What type of car is that?” The question is usually followed by interest in the gas mileage.   Acquaintances, on the other hand, if they have not seen me in a while, exclaim in delight, “Is that your car?!?!”  “It’s so…..” Fill in the blank: “Cool!” “Cute!” “Totally you!” “Gorgeous!” And then, always: “Do you love it?”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":41,"text":"These are not, I note, reactions one ever receives driving a Honda Odyssey. Others who know about my 500 have remarked my movements about town, which might be due to the fact that I seem to have the only Luce Blu Lounge in Ann Arbor: “Hey, I saw you on West Liberty the other day around noon.” That element has become a little disconcerting, and I have surmised that were I to need to move about incognito, I’d have to take the minivan.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":42,"text":"And then there are those with Fiat Lust. Fiat Lust, it turns out, afflicts more people than one would think. I parked my 500 at the pool one day to pop in quickly and grab a forgotten suit.

I’ve driven around the state; taken a trip to Point Pelee in Canada, where the odometer crossed 1,000 miles; and recommenced my commute to Detroit. All told, I've gone 1,445 miles, and I’ve only spent roughly $160 in gas, so, in terms of gas savings, the car is extremely practical.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":44,"text":"In terms of mental health, too, the Fiat's practicality cannot be underestimated. Nothing soothes me more than to hop in my Cinquecento, feel the leather of the steering wheel, and experience the calm contrast of the creamy white and pale blue dash. It even worked on the day my ex-husband returned my two younger children to me after their ten-day holiday in Maine, and I immediately discovered they were infested with lice.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-20T11:48:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"weekly windup 9 20 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59295729/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59295729,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-20T11:48:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"weekly windup 9 20 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59295666/weekly-header.jpg","fileMasterId":59295666,"fileName":"weekly-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-20T11:48:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"weekly windup 9 20 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59295729/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59295729,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":543491,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Some things we ran across on the way to finding what we were looking for.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-26T14:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"weekly homepage jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54146225/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":54146225,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-26T14:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"weekly header jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59499090/weekly-header.jpg","fileMasterId":59499090,"fileName":"weekly-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-26T14:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"weekly homepage jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54146225/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":54146225,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":544395,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"rooster jpg","caption":"","fileMasterId":54146174,"fileName":"rooster.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54146174/rooster.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"Some things we ran across on the way to finding what we were looking for.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-11T07:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"the weekly windup 10 11 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58775569/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":58775569,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-11T07:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"the weekly windup 10 11 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58775566/weekly-header.jpg","fileMasterId":58775566,"fileName":"weekly-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-11T07:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"the weekly windup 10 11 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58775569/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":58775569,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":546224,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Here are a few things we ran across on the way to finding what we were looking for.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-18T04:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford_escape_homepage_copy","title":"ford escape","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60306510/ford-escape-homepage-copy.jpg","fileMasterId":60306510,"fileName":"ford-escape-homepage-copy.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-18T04:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford_escape_header_copy","title":"ford escape","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60306504/ford-escape-header-copy.jpg","fileMasterId":60306504,"fileName":"ford-escape-header-copy.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-18T04:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford_escape_homepage_copy","title":"ford escape","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60306510/ford-escape-homepage-copy.jpg","fileMasterId":60306510,"fileName":"ford-escape-homepage-copy.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":546881,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Price:</strong> $30,425 as tested (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 1.6-liter four-cylinder, 178 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 23 mpg city/26 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> MyFord Sync voice-activated system<br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without: </strong>Power liftgate($495)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Chevrolet Equinox, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5, Toyota RAV4<br>\n<br>\nSee more specs on the Ford Escape lineup in our <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/ford/escape/\" target=\"_blank\">Car Guide.</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"ford escape","caption":"","fileMasterId":58998106,"fileName":"ford_escape_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58998106/ford_escape_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":1,"text":"<h3>What I Think:</h3>\nWhen my high school besties decided to take a whirlwind trip to the Lake Michigan town of Saugatuck earlier this month, I took the opportunity to get some seat time in the 2014 Ford Escape.

I liked three things about it before even turning the key: the low, comfortable entry into the front seats; the low, friendly lift-over height in the back luggage compartment; and the auto-opening liftgate operated by pressing the key fob control twice. I didn't enjoy the driving experience, though. It's smaller and lower than the Explorer but still more bouncy-jouncy than I like.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-25T06:48:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"weekly_homepage","title":"weekly windup 10 25","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59719600/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59719600,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-25T06:48:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"weekly_header","title":"weekly windup 10 25","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61400640/weekly-header.jpg","fileMasterId":61400640,"fileName":"weekly-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-25T06:48:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"weekly_homepage","title":"weekly windup 10 25","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59719600/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59719600,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":570818,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Here we go again with a plethora of time-wasting gems I found on my way to finding what i was really looking for.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Buying from a dealer is also the only way to get a certified pre-owned car, which often includes an extended warranty and other perks.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"5 ways flood car","caption":"","fileMasterId":56165396,"fileName":"flood_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56165396/flood_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":2,"text":"<h3>2.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

The BMW 3-series was designed to go out onto the no-speed-limit autobahn, and since it can handle that, it's all the more capable on our speed-limited roads in the United States.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":32487,"make":"BMW","model":"3-Series","year":2013},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":6},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:19:27.490-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546767490 }} },{ "_id":431569,"title":"What I Didn't Drive This Week","subTitle":"","slug":"what-i-didnt-drive","promoTitle":"What I Didn't Drive This Week","promoTeaserSmall":"I had the best-laid plans involving Las Vegas, hot Chevrolets, and SEMA.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Lunacy","id":1034778,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-lunacy","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-06T13:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"sema_booth_homepage","title":"what i didnt drive","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62710077/sema-booth-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62710077,"fileName":"sema-booth-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-06T13:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"sema_booth_header","title":"what i didnt drive","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62710071/sema-booth-header.jpg","fileMasterId":62710071,"fileName":"sema-booth-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-06T13:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"sema_booth_homepage","title":"what i didnt drive","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62710077/sema-booth-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62710077,"fileName":"sema-booth-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":571769,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"what i didnt drive","caption":"","fileMasterId":62710053,"fileName":"chevrolet_sema_header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62710053/chevrolet_sema_header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"I had big plans this weekend.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.

The bomber plant’s history is inextricably linked to the Detroit auto industry and its response to World War II.  In 1940, the United States government, recognizing an urgent need to massively expand American production of military arsenal—everything from tanks to anti-aircraft guns to munitions to planes—turned to the auto industry, as only its mechanized processes of mass production could answer the need for such high volume at such a short period of time.  It was a time of unprecedented cooperation among automakers; indeed, they agreed to suspend the 1943 model year to allow tool-and-die makers to work for the war effort.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"Willow Run Bomber Plant, built by Henry Ford on his private land, came to represent the auto industry’s involvement in the war effort and in the country’s creation of an Arsenal of Democracy.  Ford had originally been commissioned to mass produce subassemblies for the B-24 and B-29 bombers, which were to be manufactured at Consolidated Aircraft. A team from Ford visited Consolidated’s California facility, noticed its lack of standardized modes of production, went home, and asked for (and received) total production of the B-24. So it was that on April 18, 1941, the ground was broken for the building of Willow Run.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h4>Architecture by Albert Kahn</h4>\nWhile the story of the plant’s significant contribution to the war effort surprised me, I was also struck by the fact that the factory was designed as a purpose-built site for airplane manufacture by the architect Albert Kahn. In its state today, the site looks unremarkable and unworthy of preservation. Yet Kahn, too, is inextricably linked to the auto industry in Detroit, and his firm singlehandedly transformed the landscape of southeastern Michigan in the first decades of the twentieth century. He was responsible for numerous factories, the Fisher Building in Detroit, and Hill Auditorium and Angell Hall at the University of Michigan. His challenge, to create an efficient industrial space, was shared by many architects in the first half of the century.   Immediately, I thought of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Larkin Building, an iconic response to industry’s architectural needs.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"Built in 1904 to house the corporate headquarters of the Larkin Soap Company, a national mail-order company, the structure answered the new demands of industry in a new century, with the executive offices rimming the perimeter while the center spaces housed the employees responsible for the company’s workings.

That disposition of the space of the factory has been lost since the day the last plane rolled out, but a sense of the unity of the factory design remains in Kahn’s one hallmark, the beautiful aesthetic of the lights that line his industrial spaces with, well, military precision.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"<strong>Willow Run Bomber Plant represents a watershed moment in American labor practices.</strong> Before the war, women represented only eight percent of the automotive work force, but the demands of production at sites of the Arsenal of Democracy could not be met solely by men. At its peak, Willow Run was producing one B-24 bomber per hour. Such rates of production required the labor force of 42,000 workers, 40 percent of whom were women. Many of these women drew inspiration from the national propaganda campaign featuring Rosie the Riveter, an idealized strong, beautiful, patriotic woman who selflessly leapt into the workforce to help produce the items needed for war. Willow Run Bomber Plant employee Rose Will Monroe, one of many who migrated to the Detroit area from Kentucky, came to embody the ethos of Rosie the Riveter. She served in promotional films and on posters for the campaign that shifted labor practices in the twentieth century. And that's how, largely because of the Rosie campaign, this plant is identified with the somewhat inadvertent launching of a feminist movement.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<strong>The deepest historical significance of Willow Run is found in the people who worked there.</strong> Mike Schroder of Northville, Michigan, came to the conference because his mother had been a  “Rosie.” He was carrying a picture of the plant from the 1940s of his mother and two other women on break. Schroder’s parents actually met at Willow Run. His father had been an aeronautical engineer from Ford, and his mother, like the real Rosie, had migrated from Kentucky. He was the product of love from the factory floor, as were many others in the audience.

Kudner agreed that the best part of an online shopping program is that it cuts red tape. “It does take a fair amount of time to shop for a car in the showroom, “ he acknowledged, “just having the salesperson type in all your information, driver’s license, financing application, time on the job, income, Social Security number….” With online shopping, you can fill all that out on your timetable, from your home.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"“To me,” he said, “that's  the biggest advantage of the program, for somebody who’s strapped for time.

One reason the Beta program was concentrated among small-town dealerships around southeastern Michigan is likely that so many Michiganders are linked in some way to the auto industry.  “I think they did that on purpose,” Kudner agreed. “With the new cars in our market, we do 98 percent of our sales as formula priced with GM, either employee or supplier or credit union discounts. It’s a set price from the factory, and people know that. It’s kind of a unique market. “<br>\n <br>\nThe dealership has recently rolled out online shopping to its used-car department, Kudner said. “Of course there’s always negotiation on them.\" A quick visit to the Used inventory on the Art Moehn website shows that you can get a lot of information, including Internet pricing, accessory discounts, financing applications, and trade-in estimates, by moving through the site.

So why are automakers still struggling to effectively target this huge buying audience? Tinesha Craig, director of the i on Women division of the market research firm Insights in Marketing, took a look at how women view the car buying process. She found that only 26 percent of women said they were \"extremely satisfied\"  with the options available to them in the automotive market.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Craig surveyed women about their habits and experiences in shopping for cars to try to figure out what needs to change. What she learned was that—perhaps unsurprisingly—women aren’t all that different from men when it comes to shopping for cars. But there are a few places where we differ. “In terms of motivators and thought process, [men and women] are fairly similar,” Craig said in a phone interview. But women are more likely to start their shopping process online, and have a greater desire to feel informed before we ever set foot in a dealership. Here are five things that are important to women buyers. Automakers, are you listening?","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>1. We Want Clarity on the Web</h3>\nThere's a lot of information available on automakers' websites now. Unfortunately, many automakers have websites that aren’t fully responsive to the needs of a variety of shoppers. Websites often fail to clearly demonstrate a car’s full range of features, tending to focus in on its performance attributes instead. “Some women may be interested in performance, some want to know about safety features. It’s important to understand the range,” Craig explained. She said many shoppers would benefit from a full, jargon-free rundown of a car’s features and how it compares to the competition.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"We want to know how long cars will last, how reliable they’ll be, and what kind of warranty the manufacturer offers. It should be easier to make head-to-head comparisons.","type":"blockquote"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>2. We Want to See Warranty and Resale Information</h3>\nWomen also buy new cars less frequently than their male counterparts, meaning they hold on to cars for longer. This means we want to know how long our cars will last, how reliable they’ll be, and what kind of warranty the manufacturer offers. “The warranty piece, I think, is a mystery to everybody,” said Craig. While some automakers tout their warranties and resale values, others aren’t as clear. It should be easier to make head-to-head comparisons and find the details on the model you are looking at.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>3. We Expect a Little Respect at the Dealership</h3>\nWhile we’re waiting for car companies to wise up to the things they could do to cater to women in the shopping process, is there anything women can do to streamline the process ourselves? Craig acknowledged that for many women, a trip to the dealership can be a stressful experience. “Going to the dealer feels like being in a pressure cooker. The focus is on [the dealer], not what the customer wants.” This could be why so many women start their search online in hopes of avoiding an unpleasant experience at the dealership. Craig said she has walked away from a dealership that gave her “that slimy, icky feeling,” opting instead for one that treated her with respect and gave her plenty of time to test drive the car she was interested in.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>4. We Listen to Our Friends</h3>\nCraig said that in her own car buying process, she has relied on advice from trusted friends instead. That’s not uncommon: 63 percent of the women she surveyed also looked to friends for car advice. Dealers should be leveraging the socially interactive female customer by asking them to refer friends and inviting them to bring friends along on the buying process.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>5. We Want Car Buying to Be Fun</h3>\nIf you’re dreading a trip to the dealer, don't. You have the purchasing power to make it a good experience. Starting your search online could be a good way to get some basic information about the cars you’re interested in. The test drive is still a crucial step, so don’t put up with a dealer who won’t give you the time you need. Find one who will help you feel good about the process of buying a car, and be sure you're comfortable with your purchase before you sign on the dotted line. Craig lamented that car buying has become such a chore for some women. “There’s a lot of frustration with this process, but there doesn’t need to be. It should be exciting.”<br>\n<br>\n<em>Images from Jupiterimages/liquidlibrary/ThinkStock</em>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h3>Related stories:</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/getting-in-comfort-zone/\" target=\"_blank\">Get into a Car-Buying Comfort Zone</a> August 8, 2013<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/three-reality-checks/\" target=\"_blank\">Buying a Car?

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

In Ford's worldview, these functions get improved through research using the autonomous test vehicle. The next step after that will include the introduction of vehicle-to-vehicle communication, which will then lead to some autopilot ability. Intriguingly, Ford suggests there might be \"platooning,\" or the ability of vehicles traveling in the same direction to synchronize their movements for a more efficient and denser population out on the road.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-13T12:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"weekly-12","title":"the weekly windup 12 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64614657/weekly-12.13-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":64614657,"fileName":"weekly-12.13-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-13T12:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"weekly-12-copy","title":"the weekly windup 12 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64614858/weekly-12-copy.13-header","fileMasterId":64614858,"fileName":"weekly-12-copy.13-header","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-13T12:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"weekly-12","title":"the weekly windup 12 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64614657/weekly-12.13-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":64614657,"fileName":"weekly-12.13-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":594703,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>1.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/12/12/survey-electric-cars/3999453/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>USA Today</em></a> informs us that “Four out of ten drivers have lifestyles that could benefit from an EV.” Are you one of them?","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>2.</strong> Do I have a witness?

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Road Trips","id":1034777,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-road-trips","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-08T18:07:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"1-8-14-homepage","title":"what i did last weekend","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66643614/1-8-14-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66643614,"fileName":"1-8-14-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-08T18:07:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"1-8-14-header","title":"what i did last weekend","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66643611/1-8-14-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66643611,"fileName":"1-8-14-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-08T18:07:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"1-8-14-homepage","title":"what i did last weekend","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66643614/1-8-14-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66643614,"fileName":"1-8-14-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":596653,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<em>Don’t cry for me, Argentina…</em>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>Dateline: Detroit, Michigan, New Year’s Eve, 14 degrees F</h3>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"It was 4:45 a.m. when we jumped in the Acura MDX and headed for the airport for our 8:00 a.m. departure for Maui.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The

As a young adult I kicked around motor-racing, training to drive while I worked at a Brands Hatch satellite in Miami.  I've been race staff at the Detroit Grand Prix, worked TV coverage of Formula 1, Indy and NASCAR and done the occasional ride and drive program.  Eventually my racing aspirations gave way to a long held interest in filmmaking and I got my B.A. from the University of Michigan's burgeoning film program.  U of M taught me to write and introduced me to my excellent husband.  We spent five adventurous years in Los Angeles in the entertainment and publishing industries before returning to Ann Arbor where our lovely daughter came into the world.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-22T10:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"runway-ford-homepage","title":"Ford Rent the Runway","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67448208/runway-ford-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67448208,"fileName":"runway-ford-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-22T10:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"runway-ford-header","title":"Ford Rent the Runway","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67448205/runway-ford-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67448205,"fileName":"runway-ford-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-22T10:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"runway-ford-homepage","title":"Ford Rent the Runway","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67448208/runway-ford-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67448208,"fileName":"runway-ford-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":597644,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"When Ford announced a one-year partnership with Rent the Runway (RTR), I was slightly confused.

My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Driving Tips","id":1034956,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-driving-tips","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-13T08:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-car-rental-homepage","title":"car insurance for rentals","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63942398/insurance-car-rental-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63942398,"fileName":"insurance-car-rental-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-13T08:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-car-rental-homepage","title":"car insurance for rentals","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63942398/insurance-car-rental-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63942398,"fileName":"insurance-car-rental-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-13T08:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-car-rental-header","title":"car insurance for rentals","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69630735/insurance-car-rental-header.jpg","fileMasterId":69630735,"fileName":"insurance-car-rental-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-13T08:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-car-rental-homepage","title":"car insurance for rentals","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63942398/insurance-car-rental-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63942398,"fileName":"insurance-car-rental-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":616269,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"January of one of the worst winters in decades, and the unthinkable happens: a Saturday morning phone call, a death in the family, and we need to drive to Washington, D.C., immediately.

Yet, on the return leg, as I was driving on the Ohio Turnpike in some of the worst conditions I have ever experienced—a highway covered in snow, whiteout visibility, and the side of the road littered with cars and semis having hit ice and one another—I wondered, with a slight pit in my stomach, about the “loss of use” policy I had heard an agent hawking to a young couple next to me at the Hertz counter. My first phone call on my return was to my agent, Nathan Lamb, to talk about insurance and car rentals.  Here are five questions I had answered.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>1. What is covered by your own insurance when you drive someone else’s car or a rental car?</h3>\nIf you have comprehensive coverage, your insurance policy extends to any car you are driving: your personal vehicle, your friend’s pickup truck, or the cute little convertible you chose to rent on your weekend getaway. Damage to your friend’s pickup would be covered by his policy; your policy covers you for your liability while driving his car. The cute convertible? You will have the same coverage for the rental convertible that your policy provides for your own car. It's a good idea to check your car insurance policy to make sure before you rent.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>2. What about “loss of use” coverage?</h3> \n“Loss of use” extends above and beyond most people’s insurance.  While your personal policy will provide you the same coverage for an accident in a rental car that it would for your own vehicle, it does not cover the losses the rental car agency experiences by having one of the cars in their fleet out of service.   They can’t rent out a car that is in the shop, hence “loss of use.”  “Loss of use” policies offered by the rental car agency protect you against the daily charge, which varies by vehicle, that rental agencies charge to recoup their losses while the rental vehicle is out of commission.  That charge can be as much as $100 per day. The rate you would pay for “loss of use insurance” is calculated by the number of days for which you rent the vehicle.  If it’s $8 a day, and you are looking to rent the car for ten days, you are adding $80 onto your rental bill. That might seem a little steep, but Nathan pointed out that this winter many body shops have two-to-three-week wait. We had a foot of snow while we were in the Washington area, and Virginia drivers are not known for their winter driving skills.  What if the person sliding through that stop sign had actually hit me?  It may have been a small dent, but the body shop could have taken fifteen days to get to it.  Suddenly, I could have been looking at $1,500 to the rental car agency for “loss of use,” even though the accident wouldn’t have been my fault.  $80 seems like a bargain compared with the $1,500 I could have been out.  Nathan’s recommendation: always get the “loss of use” insurance.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>3. How old do I have to be to rent a car?</h3>\nWe recently did an article about <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/young-people-rental-cars/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">millennials renting vehicles</a> to test them out for lifestyle fit. Note that those drivers were in the twenty-five-to-thirty-four-year-old age range. Many agencies do not rent to drivers under twenty-five, a policy that gave me fits two decades ago as my driving record was spotless compared to my “responsible” friends a couple of years ahead of me. If the agencies do rent to younger drivers or allow the second driver to be younger, most require the driver to be at least twenty-one, and the price for those in the under-twenty-five bracket is higher than for those twenty-five and above. There are some benefits to getting older.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>4. Who can drive the rental vehicle?</h3> Typically, any driver who is not a spouse or a domestic partner should be listed on the rental contract. That said, rental companies often require verification of licenses for all drivers, including spouses or domestic partners.  Moreover, some companies charge an additional fee for additional drivers, but that varies by company and state law. Additional drivers must meet the minimum age requirements. There go my sixteen-year-old daughter’s dreams of getting in some highway driving in the rental car when we do the East Coast college tour in April.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>5. Are bereavement rates a decent savings?</h3>\n I was actually at a hockey tournament in Downriver Detroit when I received that phone call, so my dear and savvy friend Simone took care of arranging the rental car details for me.  She discovered that many of the national rental agencies offer bereavement fares.  You have to be a direct relation and be prepared to have the name of the deceased and the hospital or coroner’s information.  It may be the last information you want to think about at times like this, but the savings are substantial.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"We made it back safely from our unexpected January journey east.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Tech News","id":1034781,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/car-tech-news","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T08:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"biofore-homepage","title":"wood story","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65625616/biofore-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65625616,"fileName":"biofore-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T08:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"biofore-header","title":"wood story","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67661082/biofore-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67661082,"fileName":"biofore-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T08:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"biofore-homepage","title":"wood story","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65625616/biofore-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65625616,"fileName":"biofore-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":616946,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The cleverly named ConceptCar project is a joint initiative of the Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences and the bio and forest industry company UPM.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Aftermarket","id":1034783,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/aftermarket-car-parts","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-30T10:48:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blizzerator-homepage","title":"its the blizzerator","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61472585/blizzerator-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61472585,"fileName":"blizzerator-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-30T10:48:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blizzerator-header","title":"its the blizzerator","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61472573/blizzerator-header.jpg","fileMasterId":61472573,"fileName":"blizzerator-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-30T10:48:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blizzerator-homepage","title":"its the blizzerator","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61472585/blizzerator-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61472585,"fileName":"blizzerator-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":617119,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"its the blizzerator","caption":"","fileMasterId":66022597,"fileName":"blizz-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66022597/blizz-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>Timing is everything, and for the Blizzerator and me it was perfect.</strong> This triple threat to winter is an ice scraper, snow brush, and squeegee in one.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-13T08:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cab-homepage","title":"nissan taxi story","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68436153/cab-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68436153,"fileName":"cab-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-13T08:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cab-header","title":"nissan taxi story","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68436138/cab-header.jpg","fileMasterId":68436138,"fileName":"cab-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-13T08:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cab-homepage","title":"nissan taxi story","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68436153/cab-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68436153,"fileName":"cab-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":635967,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"nissan taxi story","caption":"","fileMasterId":62113064,"fileName":"cab-07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62113064/cab-07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"<em>Photography by Susan Campbell</em><br>\n<br>When you picture traffic on the streets of New York City, it's unthinkable not to imagine yellow taxis.

I have been in many taxis that I assure you would not have passed a crash test, and I would be pleased to have a thick piece of plastic between the driver and me.

Most of us here aren’t racecar drivers -- we’re writers and reporters. It probably helps if you’ve attended journalism school, as I did at the University of Maryland, or worked for some periodical. That said, deputy editor Joe DeMatio now claims he was more intrigued by my second degree in Jewish studies, even though he’s never once asked me to write about the exploits of Simon bar Kochba. <br>\n2)\tKnow how to operate a manual transmission. Seems obvious, but I actually did not upon being hired. I taught myself during my first month on the job by visiting six Ann Arbor dealerships to test drive stick-shift economy cars. My sincere apologies to whoever ended up buying that Ford Focus. <br>\n3)\tLearn everything you can about cars. I grew up pouring over car magazines and memorizing zero-to-sixty times as if they were catechism. People have been asking me for car-buying advice since before I could drive. <br>\n4)\tRealize you actually know nothing about cars. A brief conversation with design editor Robert Cumberford, editor-in-chief Jean Jennings, or any other of the veterans here leaves you humbled and astounded by their wealth of automotive knowledge. It’s truly one of the best parts of working here.  <br>\n5)\tBe persistent. I wrote to <em>Automobile</em>’s editors. And called. And wrote them some more. <br>\n6)\tBe lucky. I really have no idea why then deputy editor Joe DeMatio answered my unsolicited voicemail. I hadn’t even pronounced his name correctly (it’s De-MAY-shee-oh, not De-MAH-tee-oh). But he did, and here I am, driving cars and writing about them for my devoted fans.","fileMasterId":74355261,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355261/74355261.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2109,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"david.zenlea@automobilemag.com"},{"id":2110,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/101139514776041164855"},{"id":2111,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/david.zenlea"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044,6202077,6202090]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Soapbox","id":1034787,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life/soapbox","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-21T09:05:00.000Z","keywords":"audi,auto-news,chrysler,sedans,video-find,wagons,83305","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2011-chrysler-200-super-bowl-commercial","title":"2011 Chrysler 200 Super Bowl Commercial","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60507189/2011-chrysler-200-super-bowl-commercial.jpg","fileMasterId":60507189,"fileName":"2011-chrysler-200-super-bowl-commercial.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":938},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1500}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-21T09:05:00.000Z","keywords":"audi,auto-news,chrysler,sedans,video-find,wagons,83305","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2011-chrysler-200-super-bowl-commercial","title":"2011 Chrysler 200 Super Bowl Commercial","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60507189/2011-chrysler-200-super-bowl-commercial.jpg","fileMasterId":60507189,"fileName":"2011-chrysler-200-super-bowl-commercial.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":938},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1500}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-21T09:05:00.000Z","keywords":"audi,auto-news,chrysler,sedans,video-find,wagons,83305","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2011-chrysler-200-super-bowl-commercial","title":"2011 Chrysler 200 Super Bowl Commercial","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60507189/2011-chrysler-200-super-bowl-commercial.jpg","fileMasterId":60507189,"fileName":"2011-chrysler-200-super-bowl-commercial.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":938},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1500}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-21T09:05:00.000Z","keywords":"audi,auto-news,chrysler,sedans,video-find,wagons,83305","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2011-chrysler-200-super-bowl-commercial","title":"2011 Chrysler 200 Super Bowl Commercial","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60507189/2011-chrysler-200-super-bowl-commercial.jpg","fileMasterId":60507189,"fileName":"2011-chrysler-200-super-bowl-commercial.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":938},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1500}}},"pages":[{"id":636504,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"American car companies love to remind us they're American.

The Pilot, however, falls squarely in SUV territory with its high stance, nicely tuned suspension and a serviceable five-speed V-6 that will tow up to 4,500 pounds when paired with the four-wheel drive.  Up to eight passengers can fit in three rows and still have 18 cubic feet of cargo space in the way back.  Fold the two passenger rows down and cargo space becomes nearly epic.  A recent and welcome tech upgrade brought new audio and media interfaces plus a rearview camera to modernize the driver’s experience.  Inside and out the look is pleasant but the strength of the Pilot is its utility, reliability and capable handling rather than standout styling presence.  In the asset column is that at 17 to 18 mpg in the city and 24 to 25 on the highway, the Pilot is the highest EPA-rated fuel economy for an eight passenger SUV.  Safety-wise the car is coated with high tech airbags and was rated in 2013 as an IIHS Top Safety Pick.  Expect to pay between $30,000 for the base two-wheel drive Pilot and $40,000 plus for all the bells and whistles, which will be prohibitive for some.

Even though this nonprofit organization, founded in 1936, does extensive testing and surveying to come up with its rankings, the question remains: who decides what “best” means, and is this or any publication’s “best” choice the best for you? Awards and top picks belong in any shopper's  tool box of information, but as one among many research tools you should avail yourself of.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<em>Consumer Reports</em> is well known for placing a high value on reliability. The organization does its own road testing and consults National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash testing results, then rounds out its rankings using data from subscribers on the actual problems they experience with their vehicles. All well and good, but it’s important to understand what “problems” might mean.

Let's take Ford as an example, since that company was kicked all the way to the basement for 2014, ranking at the bottom of the brand rankings next to Jeep. <em>Consumer Reports</em> put that down to \"widespread reliability problems\" with its infotainment systems, as well as problems with the automatic transmissions in two models, the Focus and Fiesta. These issues were weighted more heavily than the Ford lineup's \"fairly high test scores\" in road testing. Since <em>Consumer Reports</em> doesn't skimp on details, numbers, and charts, the information is available, although most can only be accessed by subscribers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"In a separate ranking, <em>CR</em> did a survey in December about “brand perception” in which Ford came in second and Cadillac made the top ten (at the #9 position, between Volvo and BMW).

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-18T11:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blimp-homepage","title":"zeppelin ii","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64298489/blimp-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":64298489,"fileName":"blimp-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-18T11:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blimp-homepage","title":"zeppelin ii","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64298489/blimp-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":64298489,"fileName":"blimp-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-18T11:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blimp-header","title":"zeppelin ii","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64298480/blimp-header.jpg","fileMasterId":64298480,"fileName":"blimp-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-18T11:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blimp-homepage","title":"zeppelin ii","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64298489/blimp-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":64298489,"fileName":"blimp-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":639250,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Molly Blimp Selfie","caption":"","fileMasterId":68445883,"fileName":"Molly-Blimp-Selfie.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68445883/Molly-Blimp-Selfie.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":623}},"order":0,"text":"Every time I see a blimp flying high overhead, I smile.

His race report on the 12 Hours of Sebring was published when he was an eighteen-year-old Art Center student in 1954. Subsequently he has published thousands of articles on cars and airplanes, in American, Asian, English, European, and South American magazines. He contributed to several books, including the entire text of the well-reviewed <em>Auto Legends</em>, now available in five translated editions -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Polish in addition to the original English version. In 1985, <em>Automobile Magazine</em> founder David E. Davis, Jr., invited him to be one of two executive editors when <em>Automobile</em> was in the planning stages. Cumberford demurred, saying he knew nothing about magazine production and claims he still doesn’t, except that it’s important to meet deadlines. He contributed features from the beginning and began his popular “By Design” column in the sixth issue, September 1986.  \n<br><br>\nIn car design, Cumberford was even more a youthful prodigy. He sketched the body for the first car ever built to his designs when he was a fifteen-year-old Los Angeles high-school student. That car, the Parkinson Jaguar Special, is still active in historic racing sixty years after it was created. Hired directly by General Motors’ legendary Vice President of Design, Harley J. Earl, Cumberford became a professional car designer at nineteen. Leaving Detroit, he returned to California to attend UCLA to study philosophy. He rejoined the automotive world in the early 1960s and has continued to create new automotive shapes since then, always as an independent design consultant. He has lived and worked in six of the fifty United States and in France, Mexico, and Switzerland. The range of his design projects includes both racing and touring cars, trucks, aircraft, boats, hovercraft, and even ecological architecture. \n<br><br>\nHe is known worldwide for strong opinions but is well-respected in the design world because it is known that he is always completely honest in his views, with no agenda other than respect for good design and good designers. “There’s no ad hominem,” he says, “I judge the design, not the designers.

This is the reason why, this time, we are very astonished by the many inaccuracies and false statements in his story. \n<br>\nFirstly, we are disappointed by such little respect towards the Pininfarina family. Unfounded personalized criticisms, such as the ones addressed to Mr. Andrea Pininfarina, and statements about Mrs. Lorenza, do not deserve any comments. The role of the third generation has been - and still is - central for the Company.<br>\n <br>\nUnder Paolo Pininfarina’s chairmanship, the Company is perpetuating the image of a brand that is still perceived as synonymous with excellence. Pininfarina continues to cooperate with a great number of automakers and has undertaken new collaborations expanding the range of business from automotive to boating, aeronautics, industrial design, interior design and architecture, as evidenced by the many recent successful projects in the United States, Latin America and Asia. <br>\n<br>\nThe global crisis occurred in the latest years, in particular to automotive industry, is an undeniable fact. However, the crisis did not hit only companies organized around families, as confirmed by the bankruptcy of giants like GM and Chrysler. Pininfarina has gone through difficult years as many others but continues on its path offering the world its interpretation of creativity, as borne out by the Gran Lusso created with BMW and the acquisition of new customers from among the world's top 10 car manufacturers. <br>\n<br>\nGrowth in the engineering sector has been achieved mostly in Germany and Asia, in particular in Japan and India. On the Italian market, important projects underway in collaboration with Ferrari and its Styling Centre are evidence of the strong, long-lasting ties between the two companies. <br>\n<br>\nBesides design, Pininfarina provides all-round support to automotive companies by engaging in a variety of activities: engineering, product development, testing, prototype construction. More generally, we do not share Mr. Cumberford’s opinion when he argues that \"there is no longer any advantage for a company to go to Italian firms.\" Prestigious clients such as Ferrari and BMW continue to rely on Pininfarina’s creativity. The models on display in Geneva this year showcase the role of Pininfarina as the standard bearer for the aesthetic values of Italian design in the world and strengthen the brand, the firm's true distinctive character. The new Ferrari California T, together with the F12 berlinetta, the FF and many other recent projects, are part of a history that has generated the finest cars of all times through an evolution that started over 60 years ago and shows no sign of waning. And the Gran Lusso confirms our mission not only as global designers, but also as makers of exclusive high-quality cars.<br>\n<br>\n Mr. Cumberford is right when he says that the era of coachbuilders as contract manufacturers is over. However, today Pininfarina continues to dedicate resources and talents to the creation of unique pieces, reinterpreting its artisan roots. The dream of the Ferrari Sergio is becoming true for a few collectors thanks to Pininfarina skills and experience. At our style and engineering center in Cambiano we continue, as ever, to conceive, develop and manufacture one-off models and small series.<br>\n<br>\n It's a job that is so noble and so peculiar to the Turin area. It is a return to our origins, to a niche that is fully keeping with our vision, our history. Pininfarina, in essence, is still a strategic partner with which the internal OEM styling centers continue to compete on all the proposed designs. Being considered a reference point in style is testified by the many awards received also in recent times, such as the 2012 Interior Design Award of the Year for the Cambiano, the Best Design Study 2013 for the Sergio, the GOOD DESIGN™ Award 2013 and German Design Award 2014 for the BMW Pininfarina Gran Lusso Coupè.<br>\n<br>\nDespite the “de profundis” sung by Mr. Cumberford, Pininfarina is more alive than ever.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding.

Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-30T17:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-02","title":"so many rosies the riveter","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70955829/rosie-02.jpg","fileMasterId":70955829,"fileName":"rosie-02.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-30T17:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-homepage","title":"so many rosies the riveter","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70955844/rosie-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70955844,"fileName":"rosie-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-31T08:41:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"big-rosies","title":"Rosie the Riveter Reunion","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65015096/Big-Rosies.jpg","fileMasterId":65015096,"fileName":"Big-Rosies.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-30T17:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-homepage","title":"so many rosies the riveter","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70955844/rosie-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70955844,"fileName":"rosie-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":641379,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"so many rosies the riveter","caption":"","fileMasterId":70955829,"fileName":"rosie-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70955829/rosie-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"When it began the production of the B-24 Bomber in 1941, the Willow Run Bomber Plant, over a mile long, was the largest factory under a single roof.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":17086,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Simone Samano","firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Samano","jobTitle":"Writer","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"I was born a suburban Detroit gal where the preoccupation with cars is practically genetic.

I've been race staff at the Detroit Grand Prix, worked TV coverage of Formula 1, Indy and NASCAR and done the occasional ride and drive program.  Eventually my racing aspirations gave way to a long held interest in filmmaking and I got my B.A. from the University of Michigan's burgeoning film program.  U of M taught me to write and introduced me to my excellent husband.  We spent five adventurous years in Los Angeles in the entertainment and publishing industries before returning to Ann Arbor where our lovely daughter came into the world.  Personally, I expend a good deal of energy on K-12 public education advocacy.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-15T18:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pink-playboy-mustang-homepage","title":"pink car nation","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73960461/pink-playboy-mustang-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":73960461,"fileName":"pink-playboy-mustang-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-15T18:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pink-playboy-mustang-homepage","title":"pink car nation","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73960461/pink-playboy-mustang-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":73960461,"fileName":"pink-playboy-mustang-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-15T18:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pink-playboy-mustang-header","title":"pink car nation","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67150394/pink-playboy-mustang-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67150394,"fileName":"pink-playboy-mustang-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-15T18:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pink-playboy-mustang-homepage","title":"pink car nation","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73960461/pink-playboy-mustang-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":73960461,"fileName":"pink-playboy-mustang-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":672463,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Pink is a powerful mystery.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-20T07:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-im-homepage","title":"Scion Im Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87690769/scion-im-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":87690769,"fileName":"scion-im-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-20T07:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-im-homepage","title":"Scion Im Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87690769/scion-im-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":87690769,"fileName":"scion-im-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-20T07:32:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-im-header","title":"Scion Im Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87690913/scion-im-header.jpg","fileMasterId":87690913,"fileName":"scion-im-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-20T07:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-im-homepage","title":"Scion Im Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87690769/scion-im-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":87690769,"fileName":"scion-im-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":876742,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"“Most of the customers we appeal to are looking for something that not everybody else is driving,” said Doug Murtha, Scion’s vice-president, after posing with the iM Concept at the Los Angeles Auto Show.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"From the front, the five-door hatchback sneers.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.
