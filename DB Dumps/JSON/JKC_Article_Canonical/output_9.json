I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-03T17:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gmc-canyon-jean-promolarge","title":"GMC Canyon Jean Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/89240954/GMC-Canyon-Jean-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":89240954,"fileName":"GMC-Canyon-Jean-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-03T17:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gmc-canyon-jean-promolarge","title":"GMC Canyon Jean Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/89240954/GMC-Canyon-Jean-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":89240954,"fileName":"GMC-Canyon-Jean-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-03T17:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gmc-canyon-jean-header","title":"GMC Canyon Jean Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/89240951/GMC-Canyon-Jean-header.jpg","fileMasterId":89240951,"fileName":"GMC-Canyon-Jean-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":914620,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Driving this Canyon made me think of the importance of mobility to the women in my family.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-10T11:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"volvo-wild-promolarge","title":"Volvo Wild Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91320728/volvo-wild-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":91320728,"fileName":"volvo-wild-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-10T11:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"volvo-wild-promolarge","title":"Volvo Wild Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91320728/volvo-wild-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":91320728,"fileName":"volvo-wild-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-10T11:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"volvo-wild-header","title":"Volvo Wild Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91320719/volvo-wild-header.jpg","fileMasterId":91320719,"fileName":"volvo-wild-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":304},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":478}}},"pages":[{"id":924650,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"For her portrayal of author Cheryl Strayed in <em> Wild,</em> Reese Witherspoon earned an <a href=\"http://oscar.go.com/nominees/actress-in-a-leading-role/reese-witherspoon\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Academy Award nomination.</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Cheryl solo-hikes the Pacific Crest Trail through most of California and all of Oregon in the hope of finding release from her torments.

Goggles and lots of water should come on board with you; Sedona's summer temperatures average the mid-90s. <br>\n<a href=\"http://sedonaoffroadcenter.com/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visitor Information</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Attraction 09","caption":"","fileMasterId":115676345,"fileName":"attraction-09.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115676345/attraction-09.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":12,"text":"<h3>5.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-21T17:33:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevrolet-trax-promolarge","title":"Chevrolet Trax Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/94159931/chevrolet-trax-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":94159931,"fileName":"chevrolet-trax-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-21T17:33:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevrolet-trax-promolarge","title":"Chevrolet Trax Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/94159931/chevrolet-trax-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":94159931,"fileName":"chevrolet-trax-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-21T17:33:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevrolet-trax-header","title":"Chevrolet Trax Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/94159892/chevrolet-trax-header.jpg","fileMasterId":94159892,"fileName":"chevrolet-trax-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":925923,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2015 Chevrolet Trax LTZ AWD</h3>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $20,995 (LS, including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $27,405 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder, 138 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 24 mpg city/31 mpg highway (all-wheel-drive model); 26/34 mpg (front-wheel-drive model)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Chevrolet Trax 01","caption":"","fileMasterId":94159616,"fileName":"chevrolet-trax-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/94159616/chevrolet-trax-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Rearview camera<br>\n<strong>Options I can’t live without:</strong> Cruise control (standard on LT and LTZ, not available on LS), heated seats (on LTZ only) <br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Remote start, rear park assist, OnStar with 4G LTE wireless hot spot, heated front seats<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Honda CR-V ($24,325); Jeep Renegade ($18,990); Mazda CX-5 ($22,425) (all prices include destination charge)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>When you head out to the dealership to test drive new cars,</strong> it’s critical to drive only the level of car you can afford.

Honda CR-V is a five-passenger, front-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle, but it’s more appropriate to call it a crossover vehicle. It’s today’s version of the family station wagon, facing off against numerous others in a very competitive category that includes the Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape, Mazda CX-5, Chevrolet Trax, Buick Encore, and Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. Last year, the CR-V was the sales winner. If you’re interested in this category, you are probably looking for safety features, ground clearance, visibility, and the possibility of all-wheel drive. These are not exciting vehicles; they’re eminently practical, though. The CR-V is powered by a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine making 185 horsepower, teamed with a continuously variable automatic transmission.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-24T11:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"hyundai-sonata-promolarge","title":"Hyundai Sonata Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/94665821/hyundai-sonata-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":94665821,"fileName":"hyundai-sonata-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-24T11:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"hyundai-sonata-promolarge","title":"Hyundai Sonata Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/94665821/hyundai-sonata-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":94665821,"fileName":"hyundai-sonata-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-24T11:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"hyundai-sonata-header","title":"Hyundai Sonata Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/94665908/hyundai-sonata-header.jpg","fileMasterId":94665908,"fileName":"hyundai-sonata-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":926080,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2015 Hyundai Sonata Sport 2.0T</h3>\n<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, front-wheel-drive sedan<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $23,985 (base Sonata Sport, including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $29,510 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, 245 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed automatic with paddle shifters<br> \n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 25 mpg city/32 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Hands-free smart trunk<br>\n<strong>Options I can’t live without:</strong> Heated front seats (standard on Sport 2.0T)<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Rearview camera, lane change assist, blind spot detection, rear cross-traffic alert<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong>  None<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Ford Fusion ($22,835), Honda Accord ($22,925), Toyota Camry ($24,460) (prices include destination charge)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"If you’re still someone who hears the word “Hyundai” and thinks “cheap car,” you will be blown away by the 2015 Sonata, one of Hyundai’s most important vehicles.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Hyundai Sonata 11","caption":"","fileMasterId":94665740,"fileName":"hyundai-sonata-11.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/94665740/hyundai-sonata-11.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2076},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":3264}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Yes, it’s a reliable ride at a reasonable price.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-26T08:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"avanti-promo","title":"Avanti","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95163287/Avanti-Promo.JPG","fileMasterId":95163287,"fileName":"Avanti-Promo.JPG","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-26T08:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"avanti-promo","title":"Avanti","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95163287/Avanti-Promo.JPG","fileMasterId":95163287,"fileName":"Avanti-Promo.JPG","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-02-26T08:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"avanti-header","title":"Avanti","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95163335/Avanti-Header.JPG","fileMasterId":95163335,"fileName":"Avanti-Header.JPG","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":926292,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"“Love these.” ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"“One of the coolest cars ever, and way ahead of its time.” ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"“The most beautiful car ever.” ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"The Studebaker Avanti drew such comments on Facebook when I posted this photo from the <a href=\"http://www.modernismweek.com/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Palm Springs Modernism Week </a> car show.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"You’d think Studebaker Corporation, which introduced the Avanti in 1963, would have won big with its sporty coupe.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Over the years, the vehicle lineup has been expanded and now includes four distinct models that vary in size and propulsion type. The regular Prius is powered by a 1.8-liter engine supplemented by a battery-powered electric motor that achieves 44/40 mpg city/highway. The plug-in version of this body style adds a lithium-ion battery that can be charged externally and used to operate the vehicle in electric mode for a limited number of miles at speeds of up to 62 mph. It achieves 95 mpg-e or a combined rating of 50 mpg. The third variant, the Prius c, uses the same hybrid powertrain as the standard Prius but is nearly twenty inches shorter, starts at about $5,000 less, and averages 53 mpg in the city. And it comes in colors more vivid than a bag of jellybeans. Then there’s the Prius v, which is basically a stretched, wagon version of the Prius with a roomier rear seat and almost thirteen cubic feet of additional cargo space under the rear hatch. <br> <br>All Prius models have multiple safety extras like driver’s knee and side curtain airbags, vehicle proximity notification, plus the Star Safety System that enhances braking ability, traction, and stability. An available moonroof even has a solar panel component to power a heat-venting system while parked. For all the high-tech amenities available, the interior remains rather sparse in feeling. The digital instrument display is nestled so deeply in the dash that it’s a bit challenging to read at a quick glance.

The brawny V-8, integrated hitch, and trailer-sway control system make towing—a maximum of 7,400 pounds—a breeze. You do have a choice of either two-wheel or four-wheel drive. If driving challenges like steep inclines or difficult weather figure regularly into your schedule, consider adding Toyota’s Multi-Mode 4-wheel-drive system with a limited-slip locking center differential. The interior is voluminous to be sure, seating eight adults while still maintaining 18.9 cubic feet of dedicated cargo space in the back. Fold down the second- and third-row seats and capacity reaches an expansive 120.1 cubic feet. <br><br>The ultra-wide dash accommodates all the necessary instrumentation, climate controls, and even double-decker glove compartments. Still, for its size this large SUV has one of the tightest turning circles you’ll find and handles the curves with unexpected grace. Adventure essentials like running boards, roof rack, and headlight-washers are standard on all three trims. Choose the SR5 Sport Appearance package for a unique black interior. The Limited offers some leather accents and Lexus-inspired gauges, while the Platinum ramps up the mechanical tech with adaptive air suspension and a laser-based cruise control system that measures the distance to the cars ahead and brakes when necessary. Fortunately, the Sequoia does not suffer from the boxy exterior design so common in its class giving it the kind of driveway appeal your neighbors may appreciate.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nEntune audio system with navigation and the Toyota App suite.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Sequoia interior","fileMasterId":103932818,"fileName":"toyota-sequoia-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103932818/toyota-sequoia-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Sequoia","fileMasterId":103932815,"fileName":"toyota-sequoia-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103932815/toyota-sequoia-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Sequoia","fileMasterId":103932806,"fileName":"toyota-sequoia-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103932806/toyota-sequoia-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45487,"make":"Toyota","model":"Sequoia","year":2015},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:21:54.716-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546914716 }} },{ "_id":673966,"title":"2015 Lamborghini Huracan","subTitle":"So good, it could be a daily driver.","slug":"2015-lamborghini-huracan","promoTitle":"2015 Lamborghini Huracan","promoTeaserSmall":"So good, it could be a daily driver.","promoTeaser":"So good, it could be a daily driver.","keywords":["2015 Lamborghini Huracan"],"metaTitle":"2015 Lamborghini Huracan","metaKeywords":["2015 Lamborghini Huracan; Lamborghini; Italian; sports car; supercar"],"metaDescription":"So good, it could be a daily driver.

Rather than proceed timidly, Lamborghini offered the Huracán for 2015. Named for a feared fighting bull of 1879, the new car is far sexier and slightly more sinister, its face highlighted by glowering LED positioning lamps. The roofline and fenders have a purity that is risked by the repetition of polygons all over the car, including the interior, but ultimately the design holds together. Under the rear glass sits a revised, more powerful, 610-horsepower version of the 5.2-liter V-10. It’s now mated to a superb seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, which replaces the Gallardo’s slam-bang sequential semi-automatic six-speed. Yes, the car is fast: 0 to 60 mph in 3.2 seconds, with top speed of 202 mph. <br><br>Beyond this, the Huracán exudes genteel refinement, precision, and quality. With the driving mode set in Strada, for tooling around town, there’s an unexpectedly supple ride and lightness of touch. Yet advancing the modes through Sport to Corsa, for the track, brings about a serious mien that few other cars in the world would dare to muster.

It drives with dreamy smoothness, like a Lexus, yet issues a muted snarl from the exhaust when the gas pedal gets stomped. The 5.0-liter V-8 generates 420 horsepower, which is transmitted through an advanced eight-speed automatic. Three driving modes—Eco, Normal, Sport, —govern the big 4555-pound sedan’s behavior. The K900 is more than just a case of an existing car being endowed with a lot of gadgets. It’s 200.6 inches long and rather tall-shouldered, so that the 19-inch wheels don’t seem at all too large. In our driveway, it looked stately and prepossessing. The fact that it’s so well equipped for the price seems miraculous. There are two models, Premium and Luxury, sharing the same powertrain. The Premium comes with all the important stuff like illuminated door scuff plates and a power-operated rear sunshade, but the Luxury pursues overkill with an optional 12.3-inch instrument cluster, soft-close doors, and head-up display. As standard features, it adds key safety features (blind spot detection, rear cross traffic alert) and makes smart cruise control optional. A particular delight is the available quilted Nappa leather seat trim. And wait till you see the complexity of the clock that’s mounted in a dashboard. Details and craftsmanship, along with a sound grasp of the grand scheme, make Kia successful in its entry into the luxury segment.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe K900 is a new model this year.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia K900 interior","fileMasterId":103917905,"fileName":"kia-k900-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103917905/kia-k900-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia K900","fileMasterId":103918049,"fileName":"kia-k900-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103918049/kia-k900-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia K900","fileMasterId":103917902,"fileName":"kia-k900-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103917902/kia-k900-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Kia K900</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/2015-kia-k900-luxury/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Kia K900 Luxury, Should You Buy It?</a> February 10, 2015 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround/2015-kia-k900/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Kia K900 Designer Walkaround</a> December 6, 2013 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/events/2015-kia-k900-l-a/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Kia K900: L.A.

Nevertheless, it steps off smartly thanks to the direct-injection 3.3-liter V-6, which makes 276 horsepower. A six-speed automatic transmission modulates the output. Seven-passenger seating is standard, with the Side-N-Stow second-row seat function included to make additional cargo room. Eight-passenger seating is optional in the LX and SX, standard in the EX. Trim levels range from the L, which is basic without being a monk’s cell, to the rather opulent Limited. A wood-trimmed, heated steering wheel and Nappa leather contribute to the interior’s distinctiveness, power side doors and liftgate are included, and 19-inch wheels suggest a formidable paw print. Smart cruise control is available on the Limited. Both the SX and Limited come with a 110-volt inverter in the console zone, letting you plug in a laptop. The Limited has a second inverter in the rear cargo area. The Sedona’s design, engineering, and product development team have done a great job with the new minivan.

The Smart Fortwo may be a better-known microcar, but the Scion iQ brings formidable credentials to the tiny parking space derby.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nNo new features.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Scion iQ interior","fileMasterId":103912151,"fileName":"scion-iq-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103912151/scion-iq-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Scion iQ","fileMasterId":103912106,"fileName":"scion-iq-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103912106/scion-iq-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45699,"make":"Scion","model":"iQ","year":2015},{"id":"71d39f07-0bc5-39bd-9468-12085dc13b7c","type":"mediaTag","name":"First_Car","path":"/Main/First_Car"},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:22:02.583-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546922584 }} },{ "_id":678697,"title":"2015 Volkswagen Beetle","subTitle":"The beet(le) goes on.","slug":"2015-volkswagen-beetle","promoTitle":"2015 Volkswagen Beetle","promoTeaserSmall":"The beet(le) goes on.","promoTeaser":"The beet(le) goes on.","keywords":["2015 Volkswagen Beetle"],"metaTitle":"2015 Volkswagen Beetle","metaKeywords":["2015 Volkswagen Beetle; Volkswagen","VW; German; hatchback; convertible"],"metaDescription":"The beet(le) goes on.

This least expensive Beetle ($21,515 coupe, $26,415 convertible) takes the standard features of the 1.8T and is then outfitted with a navigation system, a six-speed automatic transmission, and retro-style 17-inch wheels. Inside, it has two-tone leatherette and checked-cloth seats for a look that’s indeed classic. The Beetle Classic can be chosen in white, black, or silver. The second newsworthy item is the new diesel engine, the very latest from Volkswagen’s engineers. It makes an additional 10 horsepower and gets a 2 mpg fuel economy bump on the highway. With 236 pound-feet of torque available at just 1750 rpm—that’s 14 percent greater than the even high-output gasoline turbo engine in the Beetle R-Line—it provides lots of stomp. Also this year, a rearview camera is standard on all but the base versions of the 1.8T, Beetle Classic, and R-Line. A blind-spot monitor and rear traffic alert are available across the lineup. Each of the four models—1.8T, Classic, R-Line, and TDI—is available as a coupe or convertible. The beauty of a Beetle is the combination of heritage, sportiness, and utility while still pulling off a modern look all its own.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\n2.0-liter turbo-diesel engine, limited-edition Beetle Classic.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volkswagen Beetle interior","fileMasterId":103910321,"fileName":"volkswagen-beetle-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103910321/volkswagen-beetle-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volkswagen Beetle","fileMasterId":103910318,"fileName":"volkswagen-beetle-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103910318/volkswagen-beetle-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volkswagen Beetle","fileMasterId":103910315,"fileName":"volkswagen-beetle-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103910315/volkswagen-beetle-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45233,"make":"Volkswagen","model":"Beetle","year":2015},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:22:03.671-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546923672 }} },{ "_id":678978,"title":"2015 Porsche Macan Turbo","subTitle":"Just the thing for a midlife crisis: 400 horsepower in my driveway.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-13T11:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-promolarge","title":"Vw Golf Sportwagen 2015 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106141046/vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":106141046,"fileName":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-13T11:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-promolarge","title":"Vw Golf Sportwagen 2015 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106141046/vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":106141046,"fileName":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-13T11:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-header","title":"Vw Golf Sportwagen 2015 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106141103/vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-header.jpg","fileMasterId":106141103,"fileName":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":935335,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Vw Golf Sportwagen 2015 02","caption":"","fileMasterId":106141019,"fileName":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106141019/vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, front-wheel-drive wagon<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $27,815 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $29,505 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder, 170 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Five-speed manual (standard); six-speed automatic (optional) <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 25 mpg city/35 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Heated front seats<br>\n<strong>Option I can't live without:</strong> Titan black leatherette interior (no-cost option) <br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Rearview camera, keyless access with push-button start, panoramic power tilting and sliding sunroof, cooled glove box, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Driver Assistance package (includes forward collision warning, park assist, $895)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> 2015 Honda Crosstour ($28,410); 2015 Subaru Outback ($25,745); 2015 Toyota Prius V ($27,575) (all prices include destination charges)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Jennings Jetta","caption":"","fileMasterId":106160009,"fileName":"jennings-jetta.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106160009/jennings-jetta.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Let’s start with a little full-disclosure moment.

A lot of American shoppers might prefer it over the excellent turbo-diesel engine in this VW.\r\nIt’s paired with a five-speed manual transmission or an optional six-speed automatic. The TDI, the diesel model, has a six-speed manual transmission as standard that’s perfectly geared for maximum performance, with an automatic optional. If you hesitate to consider the diesel, let me suggest that you reconsider that. You get better fuel economy with the turbo-diesel, and you also get more range—about 488 miles between fillups, compared with around 395 for the gasoline engine. Not having to stop and fill the tank on a long drive is a great benefit of a diesel.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Vw Golf Sportwagen 2015 09","caption":"","fileMasterId":106141091,"fileName":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-09.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106141091/vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-09.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2068},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":3252}},"order":10,"text":"The Golf wagon is 1.1 inches longer than the outgoing Jetta wagon, and its wheelbase has grown by 2.2 inches.

There are four trim levels, some with the option of all-wheel drive—the base SE model is front-wheel drive only and the 2.0-liter four can’t be paired with all-wheel drive. The cabin is roomy, particularly for back-seat passengers. The Taurus has an extensive list of comfort, safety, and convenience options: notable items include rain-sensing wipers, a lane-keeping system, heated rear seats, and a power sunshade for the rear window. Dune cloth is the only seat material option on the SE, but as you work your way up the trim levels, the choices expand to include additional cloth options and leather in Charcoal Black as well as Dune. The sporty SHO model can be had with two-tone leather. More important, the SHO is fitted with a 365-horsepower twin-turbo V-6 and a stiffer suspension.

Dodge says it’s the world’s quickest, fastest, most powerful sedan. Even lesser models like the SRT 392 and R/T Scat Pack boast 485 horsepower from their 6.4-liter V-8. <br><br>Meanwhile, the list of improvements throughout the lineup shows the Dodge brand’s increasing sophistication. Designers have streamlined the Charger and added LED lighting front and rear, and inside the cabin, the instrument panel now has a seven-inch TFT information display. All models come with an eight-speed automatic transmission, which is operated by an electronic shifter (paddle shifters in top performance models). Electrically assisted power steering offers Normal, Comfort, and Sport modes, as conditions warrant. Buying an SRT model makes you eligible for the SRT Track Experience to explore your car’s potential. A suite of driver assistance and safety features is available. Heated front seats are standard on most models. The optional ten-speaker audio system yields in SRT models to the nineteen-speaker Harman Kardon orchestra. Given the performance potential and value equation, it’s hard to think of a direct competitor for the Charger, and owners can always brag about their edge over much more expensive cars.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nThe 707-horsepower, Charger SRT Hellcat, 485-horsepower SRT 392, R/T Scat Pack, eight-speed automatic transmission standard on all models, new wheels on all models.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Dodge Charger interior","fileMasterId":109215827,"fileName":"dodge-charger-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109215827/dodge-charger-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Dodge Charger","fileMasterId":109215824,"fileName":"dodge-charger-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109215824/dodge-charger-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Dodge Charger","fileMasterId":109215821,"fileName":"dodge-charger-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109215821/dodge-charger-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Dodge Charger</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/at-home/2014-dodge-charger-sxt-plus/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2014 Dodge Charger SXT Plus</a> with video October 7, 2013","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":41836,"make":"Dodge","model":"Charger","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:22:10.157-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546930158 }} },{ "_id":680549,"title":"2015 Lincoln MKC","subTitle":"Late to the compact SUV party, but bringing some presents.","slug":"2015-lincoln-mkc","promoTitle":"2015 Lincoln MKC","promoTeaserSmall":"Late to the compact SUV party, but bringing some presents.","promoTeaser":"Late to the compact SUV party, but bringing some presents.","keywords":["2015 Lincoln MKC"],"metaTitle":"2015 Lincoln MKC - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["2015 Lincoln MKC","Lincoln MKC","Lincoln SUVs","Ford"],"metaDescription":"2015 Lincoln MKC: Late to the compact SUV party, but bringing some presents.","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2015-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2015-04-29T15:22:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2015-04-26T15:22:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":false,"url":"/you-auto-know/car-buying/2015-lincoln-mkc/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-28T10:31:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lincoln-mkc-promolarge","title":"Lincoln Mkc Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111057560/lincoln-mkc-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":111057560,"fileName":"lincoln-mkc-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-28T10:31:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lincoln-mkc-promolarge","title":"Lincoln Mkc Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111057560/lincoln-mkc-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":111057560,"fileName":"lincoln-mkc-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-28T10:31:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lincoln-mkc-header","title":"Lincoln Mkc Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111057509/lincoln-mkc-header.jpg","fileMasterId":111057509,"fileName":"lincoln-mkc-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":937601,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Lincoln Mkc 05","caption":"","fileMasterId":111057545,"fileName":"lincoln-mkc-05-.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111057545/lincoln-mkc-05-.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Seven-passenger, all-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $33,995 (including destination)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $40,675 (including destination )<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, 240 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 20 mpg city/29 mpg highway<br>\n<strong><strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> <br>\nOptions I can’t live without:</strong> Technology package ($2,295): includes adaptive cruise control with collision warning and brake support<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Heated front seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, remote start, reverse sensing, traction control, hill start assist, perimeter anti-theft system<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Continuously controlled damping suspension ($650); daytime running lights and eighteen-inch premium painted wheels (part of Select Equipment group, $3,230);  panoramic sunroof ($1,700); Blind spot monitoring with cross-traffic alert (part of Select Plus package, $1,100)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong>  2016 Acura RDX ($36,190); 2015 Cadillac SRX ($38,600); 2015 Infiniti QX50 ($35,995) (all prices include destination charges)","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>The compact-sport-utility party has been raging for a couple of years now</strong> and shows no signs of abating, right on through 2020.

I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-30T11:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"trip-promolarge","title":"Trip Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111408305/trip-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":111408305,"fileName":"trip-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-30T11:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"trip-promolarge","title":"Trip Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111408305/trip-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":111408305,"fileName":"trip-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-30T11:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"trip-header","title":"Trip Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111408296/trip-header.jpg","fileMasterId":111408296,"fileName":"trip-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":947800,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"My strategy for a road trip may be totally different from yours, but it works for me.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Having done my share of big drives, I’ve found 500 to 600 miles per day is about right for a pleasant experience, especially among a group.

It also sports some sweet technology, appropriately since it's aimed at the youth market, delivering text messages to the in-dash touchscreen, connecting your phone, playing your own Pandora channel, and letting you take calls through the car’s sound system.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe CR-Z is unchanged for 2015.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Honda CR-Z interior","fileMasterId":91323727,"fileName":"honda-crz-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91323727/honda-crz-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Honda CR-Z","fileMasterId":111061712,"fileName":"honda-crz-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111061712/honda-crz-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Honda CR-Z","fileMasterId":91323724,"fileName":"honda-crz-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91323724/honda-crz-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43623,"make":"Honda","model":"CR-Z","year":2015},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:22:13.988-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546933988 }} },{ "_id":685705,"title":"2015 Jaguar XJ","subTitle":"Old-fashioned luxury with modern performance.","slug":"2015-jaguar-xj","promoTitle":"2015 Jaguar XJ","promoTeaserSmall":"Old-fashioned luxury with modern performance.","promoTeaser":"Old-fashioned luxury with modern performance.","keywords":["2015 Jaguar XJ"],"metaTitle":"2015 Jaguar XJ","metaKeywords":["2015 Jaguar XJ; Jaguar; sedan; British"],"metaDescription":"Old-fashioned luxury with modern performance.

Compared with its more austere and clinical German rivals, the cabin of the XJ is a feast for the senses. But the XJ is not only about luxury. Based on a lightweight aluminum vehicle architecture and powered by supercharged V-6 or V-8 engines ranging from 340 to 550 horsepower, the XJ can be driven with the kind of verve that you might not expect from a full-size luxury sedan.\n<br><br>\nThere are six trim levels and two body lengths, normal (XJ) and long wheelbase (XJL), the latter of which affords more rear-seat room and allows for a true chauffeur-driven experience. However, even the “base” XJ isn’t lacking in either luxury or performance. Its supercharged V-6 hardly feels underpowered, and all-wheel drive is a useful option (and one that can only be had with the V-6). However, if power is your thing, either of the supercharged V8s will deliver it in spades.\n<br><br>\nAll XJs have JaguarDrive Control, through which the driver can select a setting that adjusts the engine response, transmission shifts, and dynamic stability control intervention. There are three drive modes: Normal, for everyday driving; Dynamic, for a more sporting character; and Winter, which enhances handling in low-grip conditions. \n<br><br>\nThe XJ has a long list of standard options, including automatic stop/start for enhancing fuel economy, a rearview camera, a blind-spot monitor, and soft-close doors. An 8-inch touchscreen display for accessing the climate controls, audio, and navigation systems also comes standard. It is serviceable but is not as advanced or intuitive as the systems in the XJ’s luxury competitors.\n<br><br>\nDespite that last niggle, it’s hard to argue against the XJ, a sedan that delivers luxury accommodations and a dose of driving panache.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"\r\n<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThere are no mechanical changes to the XJ for 2015.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Jaguar XJ interior","fileMasterId":111177239,"fileName":"jaguar-xj-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111177239/jaguar-xj-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Jaguar XJ","fileMasterId":111177176,"fileName":"jaguar-xj-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111177176/jaguar-xj-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Jaguar XJ","fileMasterId":111177173,"fileName":"jaguar-xj-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111177173/jaguar-xj-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Jaguar XJ</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/at-home/2015-jaguar-xjl-portfolio-awd/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Jaguar XJL Portfolio AWD</a> April 28, 2015 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/style/why-paul-loves-his-2002-jaguar-xj/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Why Paul Loves His 2002 Jaguar XJ</a> May 28, 2014","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43166,"make":"Jaguar","model":"XJ-Series","year":2015},{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:22:14.653-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546934654 }} },{ "_id":686225,"title":"2015 Lexus LX570","subTitle":"Luxury goes big and brawny.","slug":"2015-lexus-lx570","promoTitle":"2015 Lexus LX570","promoTeaserSmall":"Luxury goes big and brawny.","promoTeaser":"Luxury goes big and brawny.","keywords":["2015 Lexus LX570"],"metaTitle":"2015 Lexus LX570","metaKeywords":["2015 Lexus LX570; Lexus; SUV; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"Luxury goes big and brawny.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

He says, “The new Leaf is basically maintenance free and easy to live with. There’s quick acceleration at traffic speeds with no pesky downshifting. It has much better charging (faster) than the first generation, and the heat is much more efficient.” The Leaf seats five and, with the 60/40 split rear seat folded, up to 30 cubic-feet of cargo space. With an 84-mile range, the Leaf is effective as a commuter vehicle. It operates quietly. After applying benefits like tax incentives and access to the freeway’s diamond lane, the Leaf is less expensive, with greater added value, than you might think, especially because it never visits the gas pump. A quick-charge port allows recharging the lithium-ion battery pack to 80-percent level in 30 minutes with a fast charger. Only five hours is needed to achieve a full charge. In addition to being quiet to drive, the Leaf has a high level of standard. There’s a smart key with pushbutton start, a heated multifunction steering wheel and heated front and rear seats, and a rearview camera. Three driving modes are included: Normal, Eco-Mode, B-Mode, which has stronger regenerative braking capability to generate current. One other tip from our friend: the top-of-the-line SL with all the goodies can be a great deal because most buyers are frugal and economical.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nMorning Sky Blue paint, hands free texting in SV and SL, new 17-inch alloy wheels for SV trim.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Nissan Leaf","fileMasterId":113942450,"fileName":"nissan-leaf-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/113942450/nissan-leaf-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Nissan Leaf","fileMasterId":113942447,"fileName":"nissan-leaf-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/113942447/nissan-leaf-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43009,"make":"Nissan","model":"Leaf","year":2015},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:22:20.094-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546940094 }} },{ "_id":687279,"title":"2015 Nissan Quest","subTitle":"The design edge.","slug":"2015-nissan-quest","promoTitle":"2015 Nissan Quest","promoTeaserSmall":"The design edge.","promoTeaser":"The design edge.","keywords":["2015 Nissan Quest"],"metaTitle":"2015 Nissan Quest","metaKeywords":["2015 Nissan Quest; Nissan; minivan; van; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"The design edge.

Built on the platform of the previous-generation Ford Edge and not redesigned since its 2007 debut, the Mazda CX-9 is nevertheless a viable three-row alternative to a minivan. With 139.4 cubic feet of total passenger volume, the cabin is spacious enough for seven passengers to ride in relative comfort. Or, if you need to haul cargo rather than people, it’s easy to fold the multi-configurable second and third rows flat, resulting in a generous 100.7 cubic feet of cargo space.\n<br><br>\nDespite its age, the CX-9 looks modern and sporty, thanks to a face-lift a couple of years ago. And, like every vehicle from the “zoom zoom” carmaker, the CX-9’s styling is matched by its handling, with agility and precision that are uncommon for this class of vehicle. The only engine is a refined 3.7-liter V-6 that produces a generous 273 horsepower.

The cabin is well made but not remarkable and the 5.8-inch screen is a bit small for such a large vehicle, but wind noise is kept to a minimum, making this crossover a great long-distance highway cruiser.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe CX-9 carries over from 2014 with only two changes: a new accessories package and a new paint color called Titanium Flash Mica.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda CX-9 interior","fileMasterId":115016174,"fileName":"mazda-cx9-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115016174/mazda-cx9-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda CX-9","fileMasterId":115015853,"fileName":"mazda-cx9-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115015853/mazda-cx9-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda CX-9","fileMasterId":115016171,"fileName":"mazda-cx9-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115016171/mazda-cx9-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45118,"make":"Mazda","model":"CX-9","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:22:21.423-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546941423 }} },{ "_id":687585,"title":"2016 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD","subTitle":"From those smart folks who brought you the Miata, a sports car that lets you bring the family along.","slug":"2016-mazda-cx-5-grand-touring-awd","promoTitle":"2016 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD","promoTeaserSmall":"From those smart folks who brought you the Miata, a sports car that lets you bring the family along.","promoTeaser":"From those smart folks who brought you the Miata, a sports car that lets you bring the family along.","keywords":["2016 mazda cx-5"],"metaTitle":"2016 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD","metaKeywords":["2016 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD","2016 Mazda CX-5","Mazda CX-5","Mazda SUV","Mazda crossover","sport-utility vehicle","crossover vehicle","Mazda cars"],"metaDescription":"From those smart folks who brought you the Miata, a sports car that lets you bring the family along.","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2015-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2015-06-29T11:32:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2015-05-13T11:32:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":false,"url":"/you-auto-know/car-buying/2016-mazda-cx-5-grand-touring-awd/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-13T11:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mazda-cx5-promolarge","title":"Mazda Cx5 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115023293/mazda-cx5-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":115023293,"fileName":"mazda-cx5-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-13T11:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mazda-cx5-promolarge","title":"Mazda Cx5 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115023293/mazda-cx5-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":115023293,"fileName":"mazda-cx5-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-13T11:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mazda-cx5-header","title":"Mazda Cx5 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115023176/mazda-cx5-header.jpg","fileMasterId":115023176,"fileName":"mazda-cx5-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":950408,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, front- or all-wheel-drive crossover/SUV<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $30,350 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $34,140 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.5-liter four-cylinder, 184 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed automatic with Sport mode<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 24 mpg city/30 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Heated front seats <br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Rearview camera, blind spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, dynamic stability control, traction control, leather-wrapped steering wheel, push-button start, nine-speaker Bose audio, seven-inch touchscreen display<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Soul Red paint ($300), Grand Touring i-Activsense package ($1,500), includes radar cruise control, smart brake support, lane departure warning; Grand Touring Tech package ($1,505), includes navigation, LED lights, smart city brake support<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering (all prices include destination charges):</strong> 2015 Ford Escape Titanium 4WD ($33,085); \n2015 Honda CR-V Touring AWD ($33,775); \n2015 Toyota RAV4 Limited AWD ($30,735); \n2015 Volkswagen Tiguan S with 4Motion ($29,095)<br>\n<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Mazda Cx5 01","caption":"","fileMasterId":115023155,"fileName":"mazda-cx5-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115023155/mazda-cx5-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Does the thought of yet another compact crossover make you tired?</strong> Well, feast your eyes on the sculptured flanks of the 2016 Mazda CX-5 and see if that doesn’t help you get your strength back.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-21T08:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-tc-promolarge","title":"Scion Tc Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/118060481/scion-tc-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":118060481,"fileName":"scion-tc-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-21T08:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-tc-promolarge","title":"Scion Tc Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/118060481/scion-tc-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":118060481,"fileName":"scion-tc-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-21T08:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-tc-header","title":"Scion Tc Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/118060550/scion-tc-header.jpg","fileMasterId":118060550,"fileName":"scion-tc-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":950411,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Scion Tc 05","caption":"","fileMasterId":118060577,"fileName":"scion-tc-05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/118060577/scion-tc-05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, two-door hatchback<br>\n<strong>Price:</strong> $20,164 (includes destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.5-liter four-cylinder, 179 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed manual transmission<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 23 mpg city/31 mpg highway <br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> 6.1-inch touchscreen audio<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Panoramic tilt and slide moonroof, LED front bumper accent lighting, remote keyless entry, Bluetooth connectivity, Smart Stop technology <br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Only option is carpeted floormats and cargo mat ($184) <br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> 2015 Ford Focus SE Hatchback ($19,785); 2015 Hyundai Veloster ($18,825); 2015 Kia Forte Koup EX ($19,515); 2015 Mazda 3 iSport Five-Door ($19,765)","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>It is an interesting fact that people with the least money to spend on a car</strong> are often the people who are most excited about getting their hands on one.

That’s how good it looked inside. You’d expect a car with a price (including destination charge) of $20,164 to have a monochromatic and heavily plasticized interior, and you would be right because so many of them do. This one doesn’t. Toyota spent a lot of energy on the molding, the surfacing, and the shading of materials. The door trims are carved, with concave pieces that add shadow and light, not just straight black plastic. There’s a pebble-embossed dash trim that’s vaguely reminiscent of carbon fiber, adding depth and patterning. Plenty of entry-level cars have far less attention paid to making the most of inexpensive materials. It looks good here. The tC even has a leather-trimmed steering wheel, which tells you a lot about Scion’s focus on the driver.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"Plenty of entry-level cars have far less attention paid to making the most of inexpensive materials.","type":"blockquote"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Scion Tc 10","caption":"","fileMasterId":118060643,"fileName":"scion-tc-10.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/118060643/scion-tc-10.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":6,"text":"Every part of the tC used by the driver to control the car—steering, clutch, shifter, brakes, and even seat—is as good as it can be.

It’s the same four-cylinder engine used in the Toyota Camry, but there is no way you’ll feel like you’re in a Camry behind the wheel of the tC. There’s a decent amount of power available from a stop as well as for merging onto the freeway or passing. It’s always more fun to drive a car with a stick, especially when the stick is as good as this one.

Thanks to a latch that flips the front seat up and pushes it forward, getting back there was easy, and once in place, I found that the seatbacks are carved out for more knee room.

With the handling of a sports car and the practicality of a sedan, the Panamera has cemented its spot in the Porsche model range.\n<br><br>\nThe Panamera lineup is extensive, with no fewer than eleven trim levels. There are rear- and all-wheel-drive models, a plug-in hybrid, and normally aspirated and turbocharged engines. Oh, and there are three different long-wheelbase versions, too. Power ranges from 310 horsepower in the base version to a grin-inducing 570 horsepower in the Turbo S. A seven-speed PDK automatic is the transmission of choice in every Panamera save the S E-Hybrid, which uses the eight-speed Tiptronic S automatic.\n<br><br>\nThe cabin of the Panamera is sumptuous and bears a strong resemblance to that of the 911, at least in the front seats. One thing the Panamera doesn’t have, which can be found in other luxury sedans, is a central controller for the multimedia system. Consequently, the center console is a button-rich environment that can be confusing at first glance. The rear seats are extraordinarily comfortable and supportive, and legroom, especially in the long-wheelbase Executive models, is plentiful. The thick rear pillars hamper rearward visibility somewhat, but options like a rearview camera and blind spot monitoring mitigate that problem.\n<br><br>\nAs with every model in the Porsche lineup, there are lots of performance and appearance options. Peruse the list carefully, because it’s easy to get carried away and send the price skyrocketing.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe fastest, most powerful Panamera to date, the Turbo S, is new for 2015.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Porsche Panamera interior","fileMasterId":115627343,"fileName":"porsche-panamera-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115627343/porsche-panamera-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Porsche Panamera","fileMasterId":115627385,"fileName":"porsche-panamera-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115627385/porsche-panamera-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Porsche Panamera","fileMasterId":115627340,"fileName":"porsche-panamera-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115627340/porsche-panamera-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43160,"make":"Porsche","model":"Panamera","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45653,"make":"Porsche","model":"Panamera Hybrid","year":2015},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:22:24.284-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546944285 }} },{ "_id":687972,"title":"2015 Hyundai Elantra","subTitle":"Still stylish.","slug":"2015-hyundai-elantra","promoTitle":"2015 Hyundai Elantra","promoTeaserSmall":"Still stylish.","promoTeaser":"Still stylish.","keywords":["2015 Hyundai Elantra"],"metaTitle":"2015 Hyundai Elantra","metaKeywords":["2015 Hyundai Elantra; Hyundai; sedan; hatchback; Korean"],"metaDescription":"Still stylish.

The 2.0T has eighteen-inch wheels, and nineteen-inchers are available. There are three options packages, available with either trim level. The Popular Equipment package includes heated front seats, a 4.3-inch touchscreen, and rearview camera. The Premium package adds leather upholstery and appointments, lane-change assist and blind spot detection with rear cross-traffic alert, and Proximity Key entry with push-button start. The Tech package includes rear parking assistance, a heated steering wheel, cooled front and heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, and an eight-inch screen. The very desirable hands-free liftgate is also included. The Ultimate package offered only with the 2.0T has nineteen-inch wheels, HID headlamps and LED taillamps, and a premium audio system. Electronic chassis controls include selectable steering effort and a smart all-wheel-drive system with active cornering control. Towing capacity is 2,000 pounds for the Sport and 3,500 pounds for the Sport 2.0T. Hill start assist and downhill brake control help to manage the load. This year, improvements to the electrically assisted power steering along with a slightly stiffened suspension enhance the drivability.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

It accelerates swiftly, handles sharply, and is in general very enjoyable to drive. The main problem buyers will have when it comes to the S60 is figuring out which boxes to tick on the order form.\n<br><br>\nA glance at the features list opens the door to a seemingly bewildering array of powertrains and options, as there are four trim levels to choose from, each of which has two or three “sub” trim levels, plus several options packages. The T5 can be had with either front- or all-wheel drive, a 240-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder or a 250-horsepower, turbocharged inline five-cylinder, and in Premier or Platinum editions. Likewise, the T6 is available with front- or all-wheel drive, but its four-cylinder engine is supercharged and produces 302 horsepower. There is also a 325-horsepower, turbocharged inline six-cylinder on the R-Design model (only available with all-wheel drive), which can reach 60 mph in 5.4 seconds and still get 26 mpg on the highway. All four-cylinder S60s come with an eight-speed automatic transmission, while the five- and six-cylinder models get a six-speed automatic. \n<br><br>\nAll S60s come with a generous list of standard equipment, including front and rear park assist, power heated sideview mirrors, a leather-wrapped adjustable steering wheel, power front seats with adjustable lumbar, dual-zone climate control, and a 60/40-split rear seat. City Safety, Volvo’s safety system that automatically brakes the car to avoid or mitigate a collision at speeds of less than 31 mph, is also standard across the board. Safety has always been one of Volvo’s strengths, and we think it’s worth your while to consider the Technology Package, which includes adaptive cruise control, active collision warning, lane-departure warning, active pedestrian and cyclist detection, distance alert, and active high beams.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nBoth four-cylinder engines—one turbocharged and one supercharged—are new, as is the 8-speed automatic transmission.

Even against such a stellar group of competitors, however, the XC60 stands out, striking a compelling balance of performance, comfort, and utility. \n<br><br>\nAs with the rest of the 2015 Volvo lineup, the XC60 has new turbocharged four-cylinder engines using what Volvo calls Drive-E technology. The smaller engines used forced induction to produce similar horsepower to the previous normally aspirated six-cylinder. In addition, an eight-speed transmission helps put the power to the ground with barely perceptible gear changes. These new engines also feature ECO+, which utilizes automatic stop/start and other fuel-saving measures to improve fuel economy by up to five percent.\n<br><br>\nThe two four-cylinder engines are available only with front-wheel drive. If you insist on AWD for your crossover (and many people do), you will have to make do with the carryover five- and six-cylinder inline engines. These powerplants still produce enough power to move the XC60 along at a good page, especially in the T6 AWD R-Design, which is good for an impressive 325 horsepower.\n<br><br>\nThe XC60 is a great example of modern Scandinavian design adapted to the automobile.

This car’s price cut is meant to turn heads as much as its curves do to get buyers shopping for the most performance under $100,000. What they’ll find is that its muscular and aggressive body—with its aluminum doors and carbon fiber hood, roof, and deck lid—are not just for looks: they improve aerodynamics and stability as much as style. All models are equipped with the standard 8.4-liter V-10 engine that produces 645 horsepower and 600 pound-feet of torque and are paired only with a six-speed manual transmission. The top track speed of the Viper is rated at 206 mph, and it launches from a stop to 60 mph in around three seconds. But getting there presents its own challenges, so launch control is a standard feature, and the five-mode electronic stability control system on the GT model (standard is three-mode) will keep you on the track and out of the ditches. The interior can be described as mission control chic. The deep racing seats of this two-seater set the tone for serious performance driving, and the traction and launch control button mounted on the steering wheel give it that track car feel. Creature comforts like heated and ventilated seats and a telescoping steering wheel are absent, but technological conveniences such as the Uconnect 8.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system with navigation, satellite radio, and voice command Bluetooth connectivity are standard. Tradeoffs.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-07T14:06:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-honda-pilot-promolarge","title":"2016 Honda Pilot Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142074683/2016-honda-pilot-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":142074683,"fileName":"2016-honda-pilot-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-07T14:06:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-honda-pilot-promolarge","title":"2016 Honda Pilot Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142074683/2016-honda-pilot-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":142074683,"fileName":"2016-honda-pilot-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-07T14:06:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-honda-pilot-header","title":"2016 Honda Pilot Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142074647/2016-honda-pilot-header.jpg","fileMasterId":142074647,"fileName":"2016-honda-pilot-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":962525,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/okYPzvfjcnw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<br>\n \n<h3>2016 Honda Pilot Touring AWD</h3> \n<strong>Type:</strong> Seven-passenger, front- or all-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle <br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> LX, EX, EX-L, Touring, Elite <br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $30,875 (base LX with front-wheel drive; prices include destination charge)  <br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $43,700 <br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.5-liter V-6, 280 horsepower <br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Nine-speed automatic <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 19 mpg city/26 mpg highway (AWD); 20/27 mpg (FWD)<br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Search-Results?searchtype=model&make=HONDA&model=PILOT&year=2016\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">5/5 stars</a>; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: <a href=\"http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/honda/pilot-4-door-suv\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Top Safety Pick Plus</a>  <br>\n<br>\n<strong>Competition</strong> (all prices include destination charges): <br> \n2015 Chevrolet Traverse ($31,870) <br>\n2016 Ford Explorer ($31,646) <br>\n2015 Nissan Pathfinder ($30,395) <br>\n2015 Toyota Highlander ($31,045) <br>\n \n <br>\n<strong>Fun-O-Meter: 6.5</strong> <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2016 Honda Pilot 06","caption":"","fileMasterId":142074626,"fileName":"2016-honda-pilot-06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142074626/2016-honda-pilot-06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Another SUV?

goodbye to the minivan and hello to the 2016 Acura MDX, an upscale crossover that seats up to seven. It's the SUV for people who need that three rows of seats but refuse to skimp on the comforts of life. With the MDX, no need to do without. Sitting behind the wheel will put a smile on your face for any number of reasons. Perhaps it’s the fact that you are operating a vehicle with, as of this year, a nine-speed automatic transmission hooked up to a 3.5-liter V-6 that produces 290 horsepower. Or maybe you’re enjoying the standard Siri Eyes Free technology; or the leather-trimmed interior; or the automatic climate control; or the rearview camera. Really, the list could go on. For an extra chunk of change you can also get your hands on optional features that will make your trip safer and easier. Among them you'll find an impressive slate of active safety technology including lane keeping assistance and the foundation stone of active safety, adaptive cruise control. Speaking of safe, the MDX earned five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and was a 2015 Top Safety Pick Plus, top accolade from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. This SUV/crossover may not steal your heart with its exterior, but every other aspect will make you and your crew swoon.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>New for 2016:</strong> Nine-speed automatic transmission","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura MDX.","fileMasterId":142429982,"fileName":"acura-mdx-2016-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142429982/acura-mdx-2016-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura MDX.","fileMasterId":142435094,"fileName":"acura-mdx-2016-06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142435094/acura-mdx-2016-06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura MDX.","fileMasterId":142429826,"fileName":"acura-mdx-2016-header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142429826/acura-mdx-2016-header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura MDX.","fileMasterId":142434941,"fileName":"acura-mdx-2016-07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142434941/acura-mdx-2016-07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura MDX.","fileMasterId":142429994,"fileName":"acura-mdx-2016-05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142429994/acura-mdx-2016-05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura MDX.","fileMasterId":142429823,"fileName":"acura-mdx-2016-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142429823/acura-mdx-2016-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura MDX.","fileMasterId":142429991,"fileName":"acura-mdx-2016-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142429991/acura-mdx-2016-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura MDX.","fileMasterId":142429976,"fileName":"acura-mdx-2016-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142429976/acura-mdx-2016-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45130,"make":"Acura","model":"MDX","year":2016},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:23:11.576-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546991578 }} },{ "_id":696768,"title":"7 Apps to Improve Life in the Car","subTitle":"Whether you’re an Android or iOS kind of person, if you own a vehicle, you need at least one of these.","slug":"7-apps-to-improve-life-in-the-car","promoTitle":"7 Apps to Improve Life in the Car","promoTeaserSmall":"Whether you’re an Android or iOS kind of person, if you own a vehicle, you need at least one of these.","promoTeaser":"Whether you’re an Android or iOS kind of person, if you own a vehicle, you need at least one of these.","keywords":["7 Apps to Improve Life in the Car"],"metaTitle":"7 Apps to Improve Life in the Car -

So quit daydreaming, talking on your phone, adjusting your radio dial, or going on some kind of first-guy-in-the-line power trip, and go the speed limit if there are cars behind you, for God’s sake.\n\n<em>image: istock/Thinkstock</em>","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":true,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:23:25.843-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547005844 }} },{ "_id":697964,"title":"2016 Buick LaCrosse","subTitle":"Good old American luxury at a value price.","slug":"2016-buick-lacrosse","promoTitle":"2016 Buick LaCrosse","promoTeaserSmall":"Good old American luxury at a value price.","promoTeaser":"Good old American luxury at a value price.","keywords":["2016 Buick LaCrosse"],"metaTitle":"2016 Buick LaCrosse - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["2016 Buick LaCrosse","Buick sedan","2016 Buick","full-size cars","large sedans","American cars"],"metaDescription":"Good old American luxury at a value price.","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2015-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2015-09-21T06:26:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2015-09-21T06:26:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":false,"url":"/new-cars/buick/2016-buick-lacrosse/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[],"categories":[{"alias":"Buick","id":1025657,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/new-cars/buick","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"new-cars","id":1024395,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/new-cars","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-21T09:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"buick-lacrosse-homepage","title":"Buick Lacrosse Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146354705/buick-lacrosse-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":146354705,"fileName":"buick-lacrosse-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-21T09:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"buick-lacrosse-homepage","title":"Buick Lacrosse Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146354705/buick-lacrosse-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":146354705,"fileName":"buick-lacrosse-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-21T09:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"buick-lacrosse-header","title":"Buick Lacrosse Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146354681/buick-lacrosse-header.jpg","fileMasterId":146354681,"fileName":"buick-lacrosse-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":965638,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, front-wheel-drive full-size sedan<br>\n<strong>Price:</strong> $31,065 - $35,900<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> 1SV, 1SB, 1SL, 1SP, 1SR<br>\n<strong>Engines:</strong> 2.4-liter four-cylinder with eAssist, 182 horsepower;

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-19T11:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-kia-sportage-homepage","title":"2017 Kia Sportage Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95019823/2017-kia-sportage-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":95019823,"fileName":"2017-kia-sportage-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-19T11:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-kia-sportage-homepage","title":"2017 Kia Sportage Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95019823/2017-kia-sportage-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":95019823,"fileName":"2017-kia-sportage-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-19T11:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-kia-sportage-header","title":"2017 Kia Sportage Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91961649/2017-kia-sportage-header.jpg","fileMasterId":91961649,"fileName":"2017-kia-sportage-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":977662,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Four-door, five-passenger, front- and all-wheel-drive compact crossover <br>\r\n<strong>Release date:</strong> Early spring 2016 <br>\r\n<strong>Estimated price:</strong> $23,000 <br>\r\n<strong>Competes against:</strong> Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape, Hyundai Tucson <br>\r\n<strong>What’s most interesting:</strong> Can’t stop looking at that face! <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Kia has once again shown its knack for shrewd product development as it unveiled the 2017 Sportage,</strong> a compact crossover that appeals in every way.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-18T15:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-homepage","title":"2016 Gmc Yukon Xl Denali Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160443569/2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":160443569,"fileName":"2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-18T15:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-homepage","title":"2016 Gmc Yukon Xl Denali Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160443569/2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":160443569,"fileName":"2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-18T15:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-header","title":"2016 Gmc Yukon Xl Denali Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160443758/2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-header.jpg","fileMasterId":160443758,"fileName":"2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":977665,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Eight-passenger, rear- or all-wheel-drive extended-length sport-utility vehicle<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> XL SLE, XL SLT, XL Denali<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $51,635 (base XL SLE 2WD), $71,940 (Denali 4WD) (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $76,600<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 6.2-liter V-8, 378 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Eight-speed automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 14 mpg city/20 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Vehicle-Detail?vehicleId=10307\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">4/5 stars</a>; \nInsurance Institute for Highway Safety: Not rated<br>\n<strong>Competition</strong> (all prices include destination charges):<br>\n2016 Cadillac Escalade ESV Standard AWD ($79,565)<br>\n2016 Ford Expedition EL Platinum AWD ($67,220)<br>\n2015 Infiniti QX80 AWD ($67,345)<br>\n2016 Lincoln Navigator L AWD ($70,330)<br>\n2016 Toyota Sequoia Platinum ($65,715)<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2016 Gmc Yukon Xl Denali 7","caption":"","fileMasterId":94952965,"fileName":"2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-7.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/94952965/2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-7.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>There are stylish cars, there are big utility vehicles—and then there’s the 2016 GMC Yukon XL Denali,</strong> a prime example of both.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-18T12:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-infiniti-qx30-homepage","title":"2017 Infiniti Qx30 Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160412420/2017-infiniti-qx30-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":160412420,"fileName":"2017-infiniti-qx30-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-18T12:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-infiniti-qx30-homepage","title":"2017 Infiniti Qx30 Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160412420/2017-infiniti-qx30-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":160412420,"fileName":"2017-infiniti-qx30-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-18T12:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-infiniti-qx30-header","title":"2017 Infiniti Qx30 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/94938196/2017-infiniti-qx30-header.jpg","fileMasterId":94938196,"fileName":"2017-infiniti-qx30-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":977722,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Four-door, five-passenger front- or all-wheel-drive crossover utility vehicle <br>\n<strong>Release date:</strong> Mid-2016<br>\n<strong>Estimated price:</strong> Upper $30,000 to mid-$40,000 range <br>\n<strong>Competes against:</strong> Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class, BMW X1, Acura RDX <br>\n<strong>What’s most interesting:</strong> Voluptuous styling <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"The Infiniti QX30 is made of the same basic pieces as its competitors, but how they’re put together adds up to something special.

on a long drive on the way to holiday festivities? Road trips are a different story in December than in August. Back then, you packed light: bathing suits, sunglasses, a cooler to keep drinks chilled. In the winter, you might be headed for the sun, but in many parts of the country you’ll also face the possibility of bad weather and resulting driving challenges. Add in the traffic snarls that are a risk in all parts of the country during the holiday season, and you know you’d better prepare yourself for anything.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"As veteran road trippers—and Northerners—we are experts on the subject. We also travel with dogs and children regularly, so we’ve worked out a plan to make our drives easier. Here are our top five tips for everyone heading out to Grandmother’s house this Christmastime.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>1. Keep your road-management supplies accessible.</strong> If there’s any chance of snow, have a shovel, a bag of kitty litter for traction, and a good ice scraper on board. Pack them last, so you don’t have to take all your luggage out of the car to get to it when you need it. Another tip that we hope you won’t need:  ensure you have a spare tire on board. You’d be surprised how many newer cars don’t come with them. Again, make sure it’s accessible without unpacking the whole car. Last but not least, have a <a href=\"http://jeankno.ws/roadsideassistance\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">road service plan</a>, and bring the membership card and phone number to call if you need it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<strong>2. Have weather-appropriate gear for everybody who is riding in the car.</strong> It doesn’t matter that it’s not snowing and the roads are clear; things can change quickly. If you’re in a colder climate or headed to one, everybody in the car needs to have a coat, boots, gloves, and a hat. If you don’t ever need them, no big deal. If you need them desperately and don’t have them, that could become a very big deal.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<strong>3. Expect something to go wrong, and be ready for it.</strong> Blankets, a basic first aid kit, flashlight and batteries, and bottled water make up the bare minimum of supplies you should have in the car in the winter. Even better, bring along nonperishable foods for everyone, including for any pets who are riding along. Granola and chocolate bars aren’t damaged by the cold and give a quick energy boost. If you are lucky enough to be traveling with small children, don’t forget extra baby formula, foods they can eat, and utensils to feed them with.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<strong>4. Keep control of your chargers, batteries, and electronic equipment.</strong> There’s nothing worse than arriving at your destination and realizing you don’t have a phone charger with you—unless it’s being stuck in a traffic jam for hours, while realizing you didn’t bring a phone charger. If you’re traveling with several family members, a communal tech bag is a good way to make sure cords and batteries don’t get misplaced during the journey and make it home with you at the end.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<strong>5. Remember what you’re in the car to do.</strong> It’s easy to get caught up in the stress of holiday travel and forget that, presumably, you are traveling with your loved ones and heading out to see other people you care about. Don’t let the pursuit of the destination make you forget that. Take advantage of the time you’re confined together in the car, and try to enjoy one another’s company. Sometimes the best thing to pack is a sense of humor. Leave enough time to work around unavoidable delays on the road, plan for problems, and bring your patience. Everyone’s holiday will be better if you do, especially yours. And it will leave you in the right frame of mind to start planning next summer’s road trip early in the New Year.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":1},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":true,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:23:58.167-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547038168 }} },{ "_id":708109,"title":"Honda Sensing: 5 Cool Things","subTitle":"Our favorites among Honda's suite of advanced safety and driver assist technologies.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Designer Walkaround","id":1034952,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-22T10:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"volvo-s90-promolarge","title":"Volvo S90 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95937843/volvo-s90-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":95937843,"fileName":"volvo-s90-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-22T10:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"volvo-s90-promolarge","title":"Volvo S90 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95937843/volvo-s90-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":95937843,"fileName":"volvo-s90-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-22T10:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"volvo-s90-header","title":"Volvo S90 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95937894/volvo-s90-header.jpg","fileMasterId":95937894,"fileName":"volvo-s90-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":986935,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, front- or all-wheel-drive luxury sedan<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> T5 (FWD), Momentum or Inscription; T6 (AWD), Momentum or Inscription<br>\n<strong>Prices:</strong> Not yet released<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, 250 horsepower (T5); turbocharged and supercharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, 316 horsepower (T6)<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Eight-speed automatic<br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> Not yet rated<br>\n<strong>Competition</strong> (all prices include destination charges):<br>\n2016 Audi A6 Premium ($47,125)<br>\n2016 BMW 528i ($51,195)<br>\n2016 Mercedes-Benz E350 ($54,025)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ON3DuXGfJ_w?list=PLDtKaZSQcnJCZY-Ge8vAaMITVtB0ZsrMJ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>You know Volvo as a safety-focused automaker, and one with timeless—some might say staid—design</strong>, and there is no better proof of both than its new flagship, the 2017 S90.

The S90 premieres Volvo's second-generation Pilot Assist, which will be able to manage every aspect of your driving—steering, acceleration, deceleration, and braking—at speeds up to 80 mph, while the S90 remains under your control.

that up here, in luxury-sedan territory, it can't build a car worthy of contending against the usual European and Japanese luxury suspects. The K900 is an impressive, and well-priced, alternative to those in the rear-wheel-drive luxury sedan category. It starts just under $50,000 and comes with a plethora of impressive safety and comfort features, from heated and ventilated front seats to gorgeous LED lighting. The K900 made its debut with a V-8, and that's still available, but this year a V-6 was added, making 311 horsepower and increasing fuel economy slightly, from 23 to 28 mpg on the highway.

V-8 Luxury models have standard rear cross-traffic alert and lane departure warning systems, while these two active safety features are available as options on the V-6 Luxury. Bragging rights with the neighbors are in the cards thanks to the Smart Power Trunk, which flips open the trunk if you've got the key fob within a few feet of the deck lid for more than three seconds. Another new feature this year is Smart Shift and Drive, which puts you in Eco, Normal, or Sport mode automatically based on the way you're driving.
