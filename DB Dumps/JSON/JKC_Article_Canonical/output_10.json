My first articles focused on efforts by legislators to make once heavily polluting cars run cleaner. When I moved back to Michigan, that became my focus as I contributed extensively to the Detroit bureaus of both the New York <em>Times</em> and <em>Newsweek. </em>I became fascinated by how the automobile impacts so many aspects of our lives and reflects our styles and preferences. \n\nOver the past two dozen years as a freelancer, I've covered the auto industry for a wide variety of publications, including <em>Popular Mechanics, Scientific American,</em> iVillage, A<em>utomotive News, Ad Age, Hemispheres, Technology Review,</em> and <em>AARP. </em>I've also contributed pieces on air to public radio. My coverage has focused on such issues as the ways domestic automakers will respond to increasingly tough mandates for fuel-efficient cars while still designing vehicles that appeal to consumers, and my firsthand—and slightly scary—experience driving an autonomous car. But my stories are less about the vehicle than the person driving it.

While these are starting out on high-end models, they're expected to filter down to more mainstream vehicles in the coming years. \r\n\t\r\n  Here's a glimpse at the various systems intended to address drowsy driving.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"Great minds think alike: Lincoln's drowsiness alert system.","fileMasterId":43933422,"fileName":"DriverAlert.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43933422/DriverAlert.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":988},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1675}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Volvo's system is categorical.","fileMasterId":40600231,"fileName":"Drowsy Alert Photo 2.Volvo.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40600231/Drowsy Alert Photo 2.Volvo.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1958},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1958}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Mercedes-Benz asks politely.","fileMasterId":43745898,"fileName":"Drowsy Alert Photo 3.Mercedes.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43745898/Drowsy Alert Photo 3.Mercedes.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":3328},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":4992}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":1,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":2,"text":"<h4>Volvo</h4>Volvo was the first to market with a system. Its Driver Alert Control appeared on the 2008 S80, XC70, and V70. It's now offered as a part of a technology package option of $2,100 on the 2013 S60, S80, XC60, and XC70.Volvo uses a camera mounted behind the rear-view mirror that looks at road markings, along with a combination of inputs including steering movements and use of the accelerator and brake pedals to determine drowsiness. A set of five bars, similar to those indicating cell phone reception, appear in the dashboard. When those bars diminish to two, drivers will hear an audible chime, similar but lower in volume to a door chime, and will get a written warning in the instrument panel that says \"time for a break\" along with a coffee cup. Volvo was aiming for a more \"gentle\" sound that wouldn't scare and alarm the driver, which could cause an abrupt reaction in driving, said Adam Kopstein, who manages the North American Safety Office of Volvo Cars North America. He says the system is helping Volvo to achieve its ambitious long-term goal of designing a vehicle that doesn't crash.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>Mercedes-Benz</h4> Mercedes rolled out drowsiness detection in 2009, in the 2010 E-Class. Its \"Attention Assist\" creates a driver profile within 20 minutes of driving, which forms the baseline in determining how the driver operates the vehicle.  The system uses a steering sensor, along with software that tracks 70 inputs, including such details as where the vehicle is in the lane, how often the driver adjusts the radio controls and moves the steering wheel, and how long they've been driving. The algorithm constantly compares how the driver performs to the baseline to decide when to set off the alert. When the system identifies erratic steering corrections attributable to drowsy driving, it triggers an audible warning and a \"Time for a Rest\" message with a coffee cup on the instrument panel. The system is standard on all 2013 C-, CL-, E-, GL-, GLK-, M-, S-, SL-, and SLK-Class vehicles. Kaity Aurilio, assistant product manager of infotainment and safety technology strategy at Mercedes-Benz USA, said the inputs were gathered through 10,000 hours of testing on driver simulators by 640 students in Germany, which identified the key indicators of fatigue.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h4>Ford Motor Company</h4> Ford's \"Driver Alert\" is packaged with a lane keeping system and is offered on the 2013 Fusion and Explorer Limited as well as the 2013 Lincoln  MKS and MKT. It's also in the 2013 MKZ. It's offered as part of a $1,000 driver assist option on the Fusion and a $4,600 Lincoln technology package option that includes several high-tech features. It uses a forward-facing camera mounted behind the rear view mirror that tracks the lane lines. Driver Alert uses an algorithm to determine how much you're weaving and has five different vigilance levels. If you get to the fifth one, an alert will pop up on the instrument cluster that says \"rest suggested\" along with a coffee cup icon. If the driver continues the same pattern of erratic driving, a secondary warning says \"rest recommended\" with the coffee cup. Ford decided to package this with its lane keeping alert and lane keeping aid system because it uses the same sensor. Extensive testing of drivers who went without sleep for 24 hours and then used a driving simulator demonstrated that \"erratic driving in and out of a lane was the most robust indicator of drowsiness,\" said Jeff Greenberg, Ford's senior technical leader of research and advanced engineering. He says Ford decided to go with a suggestion for rest because NHTSA found only two strategies that effectively addressed drowsiness: caffeine and a nap of 20 minutes or more. \"We can't advise you to take a nap but we can advise you to take a break,\" he said. Ford nixed an audible alarm, since \"there is enough beeping at you in the car,\" he said.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>BMW of North America</h4> BMW offers \"Attention Assistant\" as standard on its 2013 7 Series. The system operates similarly to the others on the market, measuring a variety of driver inputs, such as steering, on an ongoing basis looking for deviations. When a pattern is detected, it offers an audible tone, along with the words, \"Break Recommended\" in the display.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Automakers have experimented with a variety of ways to wake up drowsy drivers, including emitting an aroma through the dashboard. But that ultimately has yet to be used.

Using a camera located on the dashboard, it monitors percentage of eye closure time and heart rate, along with lane deviation. Greenberg says though the scientific basis of eye closure systems is very sound, \"technically and practically being able to implement that and accurately focus the camera on the driver's eye to yield an appropriate calculation is quite challenging.\" He says there are also issues with older drivers who have droopy eyelids, where it's tough to get a clear picture of the eye.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"The technology that most suppliers and automakers are developing is based on lane tracking, not monitoring the driver's face, said David Zuby, chief research officer at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

He says while the warning may help drivers recognize they're tired before they're aware of it, \"in most cases, people will ignore the suggestion because they know they're tired, but just want to get home,\" instead of stopping to take a rest.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20554,"make":"Mercedes-Benz","model":"E-Class","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20555,"make":"Mercedes-Benz","model":"S-Class","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20556,"make":"Mercedes-Benz","model":"CL-Class","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20176,"make":"Lincoln","model":"MKZ","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20183,"make":"Volvo","model":"XC70","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20173,"make":"Volvo","model":"S60","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20181,"make":"Volvo","model":"S80","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":19287,"make":"BMW","model":"7-Series","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20177,"make":"Lincoln","model":"MKS","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20178,"make":"Lincoln","model":"MKT","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20179,"make":"Ford","model":"Fusion","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"SUVs","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20180,"make":"Ford","model":"Explorer","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20182,"make":"Volvo","model":"XC60","year":2013},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":19},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":" http://www.jeanknowscars.com/features/car-safety/drowsiness-detection-systems/index.html","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:24:20.748-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547060750 }} },{ "_id":222287,"title":"2013 Acura RDX","subTitle":"The new and improved RDX is a better car in almost every way.","slug":"2013-acura-rdx","promoTitle":"2013 Acura RDX","promoTeaserSmall":"2013 Acura RDX","promoTeaser":"2013 Acura RDX","keywords":["2013 Acura RDX"],"metaTitle":"2013 Acura RDX Buyer's Guide -  Jean Knows Cars","metaKeywords":["2013","acrua","rdx","buyers guide"],"metaDescription":"2013 Acura RDX Buyer's Guide","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2012-09-26T14:35:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2012-09-26T14:35:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"buyer_guide","webExclusive":false,"url":"/new-cars/acura/2013-acura-rdx/","canBeGallery":false,"contributors":[],"categories":[{"alias":"Acura","id":1025649,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/new-cars/acura","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"new-cars","id":1024395,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/new-cars","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-10-30T09:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"acura-rdx-2013-header","title":"Acura Rdx 2013 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/83735896/acura-rdx-2013-header.jpg","fileMasterId":83735896,"fileName":"acura-rdx-2013-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}}},"pages":[{"id":238923,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The 2013 RDX is a full reboot from earlier models, and in this case change is good.

Instead, the new model has an MDX-like smooth plastic interior and classy beige seats. On the outside, the RDX looks like a mini-me of the seven-passenger MDX, but the association is by no means damaging. More important, a smaller V-6 engine is both more powerful and more fuel-efficient than the old RDX, coming in at 19 to 20 mpg city, 27 to 28 mpg highway. The new RDX is also better around corners and smoother over bumps. Better yet, it received top scores for safety from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The basic package comes with heated seats, a power moonroof, Bluetooth connectivity, and a USB audio input so that you never have to listen to radio commercials again. All this at a much lower price point than its big brother the MDX. So, what’s not to like? Not much. Less space than some larger crossovers and occasionally jerky shifts, but the new RDX is a huge improvement over older models, and it won’t leave you wanting more.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"left","altText":"Competitors","caption":"","fileMasterId":42026077,"fileName":"Competitors1.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42026077/Competitors1.jpg","imageSize":"inline_small","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br/>\n1.

Why bring this up? Because the 2013 Dodge Dart is the first new vehicle developed under Fiat’s stewardship for any of its new family of American brands, and not only does it fill a gaping hole in the Dodge lineup, it does so with real swagger. Despite being half Italian, the Dart exudes plenty of American style. Its proportions are European, but its unbroken strip of LED taillights spanning the trunk, à la the Charger, as well as the aggressive headlamp and grille treatment, are purely American. A choice of three four-cylinder engines (ranging from 160 to 184 horsepower) and three transmissions (including a conventional manual) furnish the engine bay, any combination of which should help keep one’s fuel bill manageable, though no Dart iteration achieves the magic 40 mpg fuel economy figure that has become the gold standard among compact cars. Inside the Dart, its somewhat 1990s-esque architecture detracts little from its generally pleasant ambience, and its calling cards include its availability in many flavors, each with smart ergonomics, and a huge back seat. Prices for its five available trim levels, which start under $17K and run into above $23K for the performance-oriented R/T model, are competitive compared to other compact cars. Then again, that’s darn cheap compared to most Italian automobiles.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Speaking of getting out of the way, the Acadia (along with the other members of GM’s crossover trio) comes with the industry’s first front center air bag, which deploys between the front seats to prevent occupants’ heads from hitting each other in a side collision or rollover, yet another reason to like a vehicle wherein there is a lot to like already.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Better yet, unlike some convertibles whose back seat would barely fit a toddler, the A5 has room for four adults.

Some say it has styling inspired by a bulldog. Quirky touches include a refrigerator-style rear door and an asymmetrical rear window. Regardless of how you look at it, the Cube is a tall hatchback that is remarkably practical and comfortable with a low step-in height. A well behind the rear seats provides decent cargo space and the seats fold forward, but not flat into the floor. The Cube suffers from sluggish acceleration and unsupportive seats, along with numb power steering. The Cube choices are somewhat limited for the new model year, with Nissan deleting the Cube 1.8 base model, Cube 1.8 S Indigo Limited Edition and the Cube Cargo Version. There are now just two models to choose from: the Cube 1.8 S and Cube 1.8 SL. The front-wheel-drive Cube gets a standard 122-horsepower 1.9-liter four-cylinder engine linked to either a six-speed manual transmission or Xtronic continuously variable transmission. The CVT-equipped model returns 27 mpg in city driving and 31 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The fun quotient in the Cube can be increased with the addition of more than forty accessories, including a custom grille, an exterior graphics package and interior design kit with a shag dash topper.

The Japanese minivan holds up well against its competitors and merits a second look by anyone needing a family-friendly ride. The cabin in a minivan counts more than its exterior looks and the Quest does not disappoint in this area. It features one-touch, power sliding doors, quick release fold-flat second and third row seats and a useful rear storage well. The step-in height is lower than on other minivans, making it easier to get passengers in and out. The Quest gets a 260-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 engine linked to an Xtronic continuously variable transmission. Fuel economy is decent at 19 mpg in city driving and 25 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The Quest can be loaded up with lots of options designed to keep fussy kids happy, including an eleven-inch rear DVD video screen, Bose audio system and dual moonroofs that slide open. A total of six cupholders and six bottle holders are standard, along with four coat hangers and two 12-volt DC outlets. The dual-level front center console offers flexible storage, as does the removable second row console. An overhead front console is standard on SL and LE models.

The 2013 Nissan Sentra gets a more sophisticated look courtesy of a redesign that includes upscale touches such as LED-accented headlights and taillights. The high-performance – and thirsty -- Nissan Sentra SE-R and SE-R Spec V have been eliminated from the lineup. The 2013 Sentra gets a new 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 130 horsepower. The engine is linked to a continuously variable transmission or six-speed manual transmission. It is the only engine in the Sentra lineup. The EPA has yet to list official fuel-economy numbers for the redesigned Sentra, but Nissan says the 2013 Sentra FE+ models will deliver 40 mpg on the highway. The base 2013 Sentra returns 30 mpg in city driving and 39 mpg on the highway. Nissan says the changes to the Sentra result in a “13 percent improvement in EPA combined fuel economy.” The Sentra is 150 pounds lighter than the outgoing model. The compact sedan gets a soft-touch instrument panel, optional leather-trimmed seats and maple wood-tone trim. A new version of the Nissan navigation system is an option. With gasoline prices hovering near the $4-a-gallon mark all year, the revisions to the Sentra should be a welcome change to anyone reeling from pump prices.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong> <br />\n1.

The turbocharged V-8 is available in 400- and 550-horsepower versions with the X6 xDrive50i and the X6 M. Whereas the BMW X5, upon which the X6 is based, is unabashedly a sporty SUV, and the two vehicles share the same 6,000-pound towing capacity, the X6 never aspires to carry the entire crew: the car seats five, but the second row’s middle position gives new meaning to the phrase “in a pinch.”  With an all-wheel-drive system that can favor the outside wheels in a corner for surer grip, the X6 handles better than you might think. The sloping roofline and high-waisted body combine to make it hard for the driver to see all around, so the backup camera and available blind-spot detection are essential survival items.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Then came a slew of three-row crossovers from its competitors, and the Durango had no choice but to evolve. Evolve it did, and after becoming a crossover itself two years ago, people liked it. The Durango has found many happy homes ever since. It is more powerful and more capable, thanks to a strong 290- to 295-horsepower V-6 (depending on model) and an even stronger available 360-horsepower Hemi V-8. Like its predecessor, it comes with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, but unlike before, today’s Durango is smooth and stable on the road, not bumpy and tippy. It has more usable space in its refined interior, seating six or seven people, with thirty storage spaces and, with the seats folded, room for a six-foot couch. And of course, it is dashingly good-looking. Since it's available in base SXT, nicely equipped Crew, sporty Hemi-powered R/T, and formal Citadel trim levels, selecting a Durango may be somewhat hard. That's especially true because of the newly available Rallye Appearance group that helps the SXT models look like an R/T, and the Premium Leather package that brings red-stitched, super-soft leather to the R/T. If there are bones to pick, it’s that fuel economy is less than amazing, and prices can creep pretty high with all the option boxes checked. That said, 2013 prices have dropped for some models will help this automotive fairy tale keep its happy ending.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

A three-row, up-to-seven-passenger crossover made from the rib of the chunky, plasticky Avenger sedan back in 2007, the Journey didn’t stand a chance from the beginning. A thorough revamp, however, in 2011 brought with it tidier handling and a vastly improved interior, including one particularly cool white-on-black upholstery treatment offset by orange stitching. What the Journey did not get was dramatically different styling, which would have helped it lure people away from more established crossovers like the Ford Edge, Honda Crosstour, and Hyundai Santa Fe, to name a few. And so the Journey continues to struggle in spite of Dodge having groomed it into a reasonably nice tall wagon/small minivan. It is available in five trim levels, with top-tier Crew and R/T models (the latter being the “sporty” one) offering a legitimately luxurious driving experience. The steering is communicative, and the thrust from the available 283-horsepower V-6 is outstanding, even with optional all-wheel drive. And we love how its second-row under-floor bins hold chilled soda cans or muddy shoes. Best of all, it is one of the most aggressively priced crossovers around, with most 2013 trim levels priced lower than in 2012, starting at under $20,000 for the AVP and the range-topping R/T model starting at just under $30K. Is that enough to get consumers’ attention this year? Probably not, but it is a respectable value for those who notice.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Verano is slightly larger and has more powerful engines than the Cruze—its engines are sourced from Buick’s larger Regal—and it also has premium touches such as wood trim, a center-stack dashboard with standard IntelliLink, and a rearview camera as standard. A heated steering wheel, leather interior, and a power sunroof are all available. New for 2013, there’s a turbocharged four-cylinder engine. This model offers 250 horsepower while providing 31 mpg on the highway, only a 1-mpg penalty over the standard engine, for the Verano with the six-speed manual transmission that’s a no-cost option. Mileage figures for the turbo Verano with automatic transmission aren’t out yet. This sedan nominally seats five but would be more comfortable for four. Another less than comfortable feature is the overly busy front end. It features a set of portholes that, although a traditional Buick design cue, are out of place on this small car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

It pulls off the difficult trick of being cushy and rugged all at once – but it is better at hauling people than cargo. Ride and handling are improved since the QX has been designed as an SUV rather than being built off a modified pickup-truck platform. Still, the QX’s snow and tow modes made it a valiant performer in bad weather and boat transportation. It can haul up to 8,500 pounds. Buyers should be prepared to shell out major bucks at the gas pump. Both the rear- and four-wheel drive versions of the QX return only 14 mpg in city driving and 20 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The standard 5.6-liter V-8 engine has direct fuel injection and makes 400 horsepower. It is linked to a seven-speed automatic transmission. The enormous SUV can seat up to eight in three rows of leather-lined luxury. Check the box for the no-cost split bench seat if you need room for eight. While 2013 pricing has yet to be announced, expect to pay over $60,000 for the biggest SUV in the Infiniti lineup. The price escalates if you add such options as the $2,950 theater package, which includes dual seven-inch color monitors with wireless remote to keep the kids entertained on long trips.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Fifth seat or not, rear legroom is tight in this little automobile. Of course, space isn’t the main selling point of the 500. It shines in styling, maneuverability, and fuel economy. Better yet, it is available as a convertible, and Fiat will soon offer a new Turbo model with a beefier engine and a Beats by Dr. Dre sound system for your increased aural pleasure. The 500 earns up to 38 miles per gallon on the highway, depending on the model, and up to 30 miles to the gallon in the city. The interior is distinctive and almost minimalist, with available two-tone seating and a surprisingly uncluttered two-tone dash. If you have a little extra money to spend, a Gucci model is available with the iconic red-and-green stripe adorning the exterior, the seatbelts, and the seatbacks. The seats are also embellished with Gucci leather bearing the fashion house’s logo in either black or white.

It’s not only the appearance that is up to date; the 2013 Escape also has numerous top-flight safety features including roll stability control, integrated blind spot mirrors, side air curtains for the first and second rows, and an optional blind spot information system that displays alerts in the side mirrors if there’s another vehicle in the driver’s blind spot. Ford is most proud of the curve control system, which automatically slows down the Escape if it’s taking corners too quickly—a segment first, the automaker notes. At the other end of the spectrum, there’s torque vectoring control, which helps the driver accelerate smoothly through a turn. Looks like Ford has all the bases covered with this five-passenger crossover. Did we mention 33 mpg on the highway, if you opt for the smallest EcoBoost engine? You would still get 178 horsepower from that 1.6-liter four-cylinder, meaning the penalty you have to suffer for good fuel economy is getting smaller all the time.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

It could be an important car for you, too, since 37 mpg on the highway is expected for the version with EcoBoost four-cylinder engine.  That’s really terrific for a mid-size sedan. There are two other four-cylinder engine choices, and auto start/stop technology is another gas saver on versions with the six-speed automatic transmission. Even better for the fuel conscious, Ford Fusion Hybrid and Energi models are out, too. The Hybrid is projected to get the equivalent of 44 mpg in town and 47 mpg on the highway, and the plug-in hybrid Energi is looking at 100 MPGe (equivalent) when it gets the EPA's official numbers this fall. Looks-wise, the new Fusion has a trapezoidal grille, a sleeker body design and a more modern silhouette than the previous model. It’s so much sleeker that aerodynamic drag is actually down by 10 percent from the previous Fusion.

Though not seriously deficient in any way, this Civic fails to make a tangible improvement over earlier years. Still, the Civic offers a little something for everyone, with plenty of models, including a hybrid and fuel-efficient HF sedan, both achieving a stellar EPA rating above 40 mpg on the highway. The interior is dull plastic and the navigation system could be more streamlined, but the 2012 did manage to find nearly four cubic feet of extra cargo space despite an unchanged exterior size. It goes without saying that the Civic is reliable, drives well, and has a fantastic resale value. The Civic’s price is unbeatable, and offers a great value per dollar. The cheapest base model is highly affordable at just over $16,000, with the price range topping out at a still-reasonable $30,000. The 2012 Civic is good but maybe too familiar, and with a (potentially more enticing) reboot only months away, it could be worth the wait.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 4","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

The Azera received lots of kudos for its redesign, which includes a more contemporary look courtesy of the Korean automaker’s fluidic styling, a roomy cabin and an affordable price tag in the neighborhood of $33,000. The Azera is an excellent choice, especially when you compare it to more expensive Hyundai offerings, including the $60,000 Hyundai Equus. Buyers who want extra pampering can opt for a $4,000 technology package that bundles such items as a panoramic moonroof, xenon headlights, rear sunshades, and a powerful stereo. An unusual feature is a standard navigation system with a rear backup camera. Another plus is that the navigation system is one of the easiest to use in this segment. The Azera is equipped with a 293-horsepower direct-injection 3.3-liter V-6 engine linked to a six-speed automatic transmission. Gas mileage is good at 20 mpg in the city and 30 on the highway, but not as good as some of Azera’s key domestic competitors, including the 2013 Ford Taurus. The Azera has been criticized for its artificial steering feel, some visibility issues, and some cabin trim that may not feel quite as luxurious as it should. But it’s become a solid choice for shoppers who need a large sedan and don’t want to pay a fortune for a deluxe look and lots of standard equipment. The Azera is no longer a Lexus wannabe. It has come into its own.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The standard 5.0-liter V-8 model and the 4.6-liter V-8 model have been discontinued. The 429-horsepower 5.0-liter Tau V-8 engine is available only on the 2013 Hyundai Genesis 5.0 R-Spec model. Hyundai says this has been done to simplify the lineup, but in reality, the two discontinued models lagged behind the 333-horsepower 3.8-liter V-6 engine models in terms of fuel-economy ratings. Hyundai has positioned itself as a fuel-economy leader in the U.S. The 3.8-liter V-6 variants of the Genesis return 19 mpg in city driving and 29 mpg on the highway. The V-6 models are available in three equipment configurations for the 2013. All models are equipped with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The 2013 Genesis gets a few tweaks in advance of an anticipated redesign in 2014. The minor changes include a new optional eight-inch display with navigation and an enhanced multi-media controller and Driver Information System. The Hyundai Blue Link telematics system is now optional with the Ultimate Navigation package.  The Genesis has a pleasing design and such exterior details as standard seventeen-inch alloy wheels. Safety features include eight standard air bags and an optional lane departure warning system on the 3.8 Technology package and 5.0 R-Spec models. The Genesis Coupe is a separate vehicle that targets sports cars like the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong><br />\n1.

The front and second rows have roomy captain's seats, available in leather or leatherette. Perhaps the Routan’s most impressive features are its thirteen cupholders, including four mounted on a sliding center console. It’s not entirely clear why thirteen cupholders are necessary in a car whose maximum capacity is seven, but Volkswagen certainly has not skimped on convenience. The V-6 engine is powerful enough to carry a loaded Routan, though this has a predictable negative impact on the Routan’s fuel economy.

The clean diesel Golf has a combined fuel economy of 34 miles to the gallon, which is just barely beaten by the Smart ForTwo’s combined 36 miles to the gallon. With a cabin that looks much more sophisticated than the exterior, it is hard to believe that the Golf starts at just under $19,000.

The front and rear exterior portions of the CC received a redesign for 2013, enhancing the aggressive front end while keeping the swept-back windshield, low rear roof, and sleek back end of the 2012 model. The CC is a good-looking car any way you slice it. The available two-tone interior with brushed metal trim looks good without looking the same as the interior of every other sedan in its category. Even better, the CC has expanded its rear seat so that five people can enjoy the sumptuous interior. Bluetooth and iPod connectivity come standard and the Executive model comes with a Dynaudio sound system.  With the Passat receiving a huge price reduction, the CC may seem a little pricey by comparison, but the CC is still a good car at a good value.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

There are also numerous compartments to stow your life’s necessities, like phones and purses. With more room comes more fuel economy in the Impreza. This isn’t normally something you would see in the same sentence, but Subaru has figured out how to get more than 30 percent more fuel economy in the Impreza. Even equipped with Subaru’s well-known all-wheel drive, the Impreza is projected to get 27 MPG city and 36 MPG on the highway. The new Impreza’s exterior has gone through a makeover, returning to Subaru’s original sporty design. You can choose between a four-door or five-door model, both with bolder and more dynamic exterior designs. Both models come standard with carpeted floor mats, a standard item most automakers don’t offer. Also offered is more flexible storage space, including a split-folding back seat, perfect for transporting life’s adventures.

After its first redesign, the car looks significantly different, and hasn’t improved much on handling or fuel economy. Some of the xB’s issues are mitigated by an available package from Toyota Racing Development that smooths out the handling, and the xB is extremely utilitarian for such a small car. It seats five with the seats up and boasts enough space for a move across town or a trip to Home Depot with the seats down. The spacious interior echoes the xB’s oddball aesthetic with a center-mounted dashboard and color-contrasting audio control nobs. That unconventional arrangement fits with the xB’s unique attitude, and if the base interior feels sparse it can be conveniently upgraded with all manner of Scion extras. Some of the most enticing add-ons include a navigation system and a rear-seat DVD player. Scion’s “one and done” business model could mean that the 2012 xB will be the last one, though the demise of the lovable toaster-on-wheels has yet to be confirmed. Even if it is on its last leg, the xB is affordable, practical, and it makes a statement as soon as it turns the corner.

Or for efficiency’s sake, you can select the turbo-diesel V-6 in the S350 Bluetec 4Matic or the S450 hybrid, which returns 19 mpg city and 25 mpg highway. Overall, there are six engines in the lineup, and all but one is turbocharged. These range from gas and diesel V-6s to a pair of V-8s and also a pair of V-12s. Seven-speed automatic transmissions have to cope with all this output except for the particularly beleaguered five-speed in the S65 AMG. All-wheel drive is only offered in combination with the diesel. Of course, the interior of the S-Class is lavish enough for a pasha or a panjandrum, should you need to transport one.

The cabin can come equipped with attractive sport seats and a satellite radio with one-year subscription. With three different bodies (wagon, hard-top, and convertible) and three different trim levels, the Cooper’s options are extensive. Even if you’ve made the big choices, there are what Mini claims to be 10 million customization combinations. All of those choices piled up can make the car a little pricey, even with its relatively low base price.

The trunk is also wood-lined, and can extend out until it is a good imitation of a picnic table.

In 2012, the big pickups got a six-speed automatic transmission, a boon to those who use the trucks for their intended purpose of hauling heavy stuff. The six-speed manual is also good for heavy loads with its low first-gear ratio, though. A 383-horsepower Hemi V-8 is standard, but a 6.7-liter turbo-diesel six is also available and makes 350 horsepower. The heavy-duty Rams come in eight variants and three cab styles up to the top Laramie Longhorn edition. The Power Wagon version is higher off the ground and has off-road tires, heavy-duty Bilstein shocks, skid plate protection underneath, and other adaptations for off-road excursions. Inside, you’ll find a steering wheel with finger controls, and you can get heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, and a heated steering wheel, as well as two-tone upholstery, Sirius backseat TV with three channels to choose from, and Chrysler’s Uconnect multimedia system with ten speakers. There’s in-floor storage, plus, this thing can tow up to a 22,750-pound trailer if you opt for the Max Tow package on the 3500. You might be interested to know that Chrysler finds 50 percent of heavy-truck buyers are planning to use them for work – while 100 percent are planning to use them for fun and leisure. The HD Ram is meant to handle that tractor you need for the field, but also that boat or ATV you want for the weekend.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tChevrolet Silverado HD<br />\n2.\tFord F-Series Super Duty<br />\n3.\tGMC Sierra HD","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items: </strong><br />\n1.\tSirius backseat TV.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585478,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585478/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>New for 2013 </strong><br />\n1. 6’4” bed option on Crew Cab – allows you to have the largest cab with the largest four-door body style and the largest bed option.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"Trucks","classGroup":"Truck","color":"","id":15406,"make":"Ram","model":"","year":2012},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20466,"make":"Ram","model":"","year":2012},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"8bfe9141-264d-3530-adde-b612c376b580","type":"mediaTag","name":"Trucks","path":"/Main/Trucks"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":15},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:24:43.344-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547083345 }} },{ "_id":222739,"title":"The VooDoo Dolls and Me","subTitle":"Love these women!","slug":"voodoo-dolls","promoTitle":"The VooDoo Dolls and Me","promoTeaserSmall":"The VooDoo Dolls and I bond over cars and talk tattoos in Texas.","promoTeaser":"The VooDoo Dolls and I bond over cars and talk tattoos in Texas.","keywords":["voodoo dolls"],"metaTitle":"The VooDoo Dolls and Me  - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["VooDoo Dolls","car club","collector cars"],"metaDescription":"The VooDoo Dolls and Me: Jean Jennings of JeanKnowsCars.com visits the VooDoo Dolls car club in Austin, Texas, and talks to them about cars.","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2012-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2012-10-16T10:00:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2012-09-30T18:04:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":false,"url":"/you-auto-know/fast-women/voodoo-dolls/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[{"id":3828,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings, President and Editor in Chief","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"","enableBioPage":false,"bio":"Jean Jennings has been writing about cars and the car business for more than thirty years.

But the subcompact delivers low fuel economy for such a small car – and doesn’t even hit the magic 40-mpg mark in highway driving. The Mazda 2 also has a steep base price for such a small car, with the base 2013 Sport model starting at over $15,000. An uplevel Mazda 2 Touring model tops $17,000. On the plus side, the Mazda 2 enters the post-modern world with a new USB port, something it lacked in the past. Its refined four-cylinder engine feels livelier than its 100-horsepower rating would suggest, especially when it’s linked to the five-speed manual transmission. A four-speed automatic transmission is optional. There’s no denying that the five-seater is a fun-to-drive city car, but there may be too many compromises for some. The Mazda 2 has a tight back seat and limited cargo room. It lacks the luxury features available in newer subcompacts like the Ford Fiesta. That means no navigation system or heated seats. The Touring model is the way to go if you’re looking for amenities. It includes fifteen-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, chrome exhaust tips, cruise control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and an audio system with six speakers. The main problem with the Mazda 2 occurs once comparison shopping begins. When you stack it up against its sizeable competition, it’s merely average.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Still a monstrously powerful supercar but slightly less obnoxious than the wily Vipers of yore, the 2013 Viper shed its fiberglass skin in favor of more elegant, organically shaped carbon fiber and aluminum body panels that save weight while allow for far more consistent body gaps. The Viper also shed the Dodge brand name in favor of Chrysler’s Street and Racing Technology—a.k.a. SRT—brand name. Base Vipers gain infinitely more refined interiors with a customizable instrument screen and far more creature comforts (and alas, the floorboards will no longer melt your tennis shoes). The even sharper-edged (and $23,000 more expensive!) GTS model receives additional leather trim, an adjustable suspension, upgraded brakes and more. The re-imagined exterior lighting includes LED running lamps and taillamps, but the overall look is pure Viper, including the double-bubble roof (ostensibly for helmet clearance). An 8.4-liter V-10 still resides under the hood, this time with new fewer than 640 horsepower (not sure how much that is in snakepower, but it’s certainly a lot). Missing from the lineup at this point is a roadster model; the 2013 model year appears to be for coupes only. Don’t expect Dodge—er, SRT—to stay out of the convertible business for long, though.

Part of its appeal this year will be a Luxury Edition package that includes heated leather front seats, a premium Bose audio system with eight speakers, a universal home remote control, and other quality-of-life features. The uplevel LT and LTZ models will be available in a new Crystal Red Tintcoat color to help the old Impala go out with a flourish. The 2013 Impala comes with a 3.6-liter V-6 that makes 300 horsepower, coupled to a six-speed automatic transmission. Despite its old-school size and shape, this sedan gets up to 30 mpg on the highway. The upcoming 2014 model will be available with a choice of three new engines, two four-cylinders (one of which is a mild hybrid) and a V-6, to go with its new look. It’s scheduled to come out in early 2013. The Chevrolet Impala may not get anybody’s heart racing, but it fills the bill just fine if what you want is a traditional big sedan.

Parent Jaguar Land Rover calls it the world’s first SUV with an all-aluminum structure. The dramatic changes are expected to deliver a significant improvement in fuel economy, although the EPA has not yet released any official numbers. The outgoing model with a 5.0-liter V-8 and six-speed automatic transmission returns a dismal 12 mpg in city driving. The 2013 Range Rover gets carryover V-8 engines enhanced by new eight-speed ZF automatic transmissions. The redesigned Range Rover also gets a re-engineered four-corner air suspension and new suspension architecture to deliver flatter cornering abilities. The cabin gets tweaked as well, with rear legroom increased by 4.7 inches. A two-place rear seating package is optional. The new Range Rover also borrows some design cues from the glamorous Range Rover Evoque. Plus there are 37 exterior paint choices. You may reach for the smelling salts once you check out the sticker price, however. The redesigned 2013 Range Rover starts at $83,500, including an $850 destination charge, reflecting a $3,225 increase over the outgoing model. The top-of-the-line Range Rover Autobiography starts at $130,950, including shipping, reflecting a $4,285 increase over the outgoing model. On the plus side, the Range Rover is priced lower than one of its chief rivals, the 2013 Mercedes-Benz GL550, which starts at $87,805, including a $905 destination charge.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":29,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":58,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong>:<br/>\n1.

Is Lexus out of touch? If you have to ask, you’re obviously not among the “one-percenters” at whom the LX570 is aimed. Compared to Toyota’s (slightly) cheaper Land Cruiser, with which the LX570 shares many of its dirty parts, the LX570 gains distinction primarily because of its elegant Lexus styling (complete with Lexus’s new spindle grille and LED taillamps) and fancy-schmancy interior, thus allowing it to compete with high-profile status symbols such as Cadillac’s blingy Escalade and Land Rover’s legendary Range Rover. Of course, a truck this massive requires a huge engine with huge power, which, not surprisingly, comes at a cost in the form of abysmal fuel economy. Then again, that particular point tends to be more of a concern for the ninety-nine-percenters; this vehicle’s target market will be much more interested in the new Parchment leather option, spacious seven-passenger seating, and the refreshed interior with mahogany wood trim and black chrome accents. They may not even care about the pittance of cargo space behind the third-row seat.

The five-passenger CX-5 has lots to recommend it. It’s one of the few small SUVs to offer a manual transmission, but buyers can opt for the six-speed manual transmission or six-speed automatic transmission. It also delivers better gas mileage than many of its competitors, including the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, and Ford Escape. The CX-5 with the 155-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and six-speed manual delivers 26 mpg in the city and 35 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The CX-5 uses Mazda’s new Skyactiv Technology that reduces fuel consumption and emissions without compromising driving performance. But the small Japanese SUV is far from being just a sensible pair of shoes. The shapely CX-5 is for style-conscious buyers who like Jimmy Choo and Jason Wu. There is a full complement of standard safety features, including six air bags, antilock brakes, stability control, and traction control. Options include a blind spot monitoring system and adaptive front headlights. The CX-5 doesn’t break much new ground in the cabin, but it is one of the most affordable small SUVs on the market. The base 2013 CX-5 Sport starts at $21,490, including a $795 destination charge, making it less expensive than the CR-V, RAV4, and Escape.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":29,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":58,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong>:<br/>\n1.

The reason is the Passat TDI's clean diesel engine. It's not like the diesel-powered cars you might remember from the past; this one is not smelly and not noisy, and it gives the Passat 40 mpg on the highway and an 800-mile range between fillups. \n<br>\n<br>Despite these advantages, diesels still make up only a small minority of U.S. vehicle sales, hovering in the two percent region, and diesel fuel currently costs more per gallon than gasoline. There's also a major price premium to buy a diesel version of the Passat: it costs $5,405 more for the base TDI than for the base gasoline-powered Passat. The model I'm looking at in this video is the SE, with sunroof and navigation system. The Passat is fairly well equipped, and there are few options available. Among them are a lip spoiler ($375), a trunk liner ($125), and a set of wheel locks ($100).\n\nThe Passat's 2.0-liter engine makes 140 horsepower, and the car is equipped with elecctronic stability control, anti-slip regulation (ASR), an electronic differential lock, and radio navigation.

According to Kitts, the city of Ann Arbor conducted a year-long study to determine whether members of a certain race were being targeted over others. “You know what we found?

As a writer and publisher for BU’s online magazine, I wrote about politics and current events and wrote two series: Foxy Congressperson of the Week, which is exactly what it sounds like, and An American in Paris, detailing my misadventures abroad. \n\nGrowing up in Southeastern Michigan means that love of cars is practically a birthright, and one I’ve always been proud of.

I really don't. The freedom of getting behind the wheel of a car and just taking off can't be compared with anything else. You really feel that you’re in charge: in charge of the car, in charge of the road, and in charge of your life. Why on earth would you want someone else to drive you around when you could do it yourself? It’s so liberating! Obviously, I love driving. I suppose that isn't a particularly original statement for a Detroit native, but it's true. I was a little late getting my driver's license because of that pesky parallel parking, but once I got it, nothing could stop me. It doesn't matter if I have to chauffeur my grandmother to the bank less than a block from our house or drive across town. If I have my green Chrysler LHS--affectionately christened \"Betsy\" by my mother--and some gas in the tank, and if I am somehow able to avoid getting pulled over for driving just a little too fast, I'm good to go.\n\nSince I graduated from the University of Michigan, in April 2012, Betsy has taken me everywhere. She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn’t as dry as a piece of chalk…And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there. Not only am I a bibliophile, but I’m also a self-proclaimed Anglophile who loves Shakespeare and Elizabethan verse and one day plans to see the Houses of Parliament, visit the Tower of London, and, perhaps most important, eat real fish and chips.

The company employs certified technicians who receive ongoing training in customer service practices, working with new vehicle materials and technologies like carbon fiber and waterborne paint, and using new repair processes.

According to Byers, neither the age of the vehicle nor the make or model will affect Carstar technicians' abilities to perform auto body repairs. Carstar technicians are trained to work on all cars, regardless of their age or nation of origin. To make the repair process smoother for the customer, Carstar also retains a team of insurance experts who coordinate vehicle repair with more than eighty insurance carriers, including well-known ones such as Allstate, Farmers Insurance Group, Geico, Liberty Mutual, Nationwide, and Progressive.</ol>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<ol>\r\n<strong>3.\tYour car is always safe and never really out of your sight.</strong> A universal worry when a car enters a shop for collision repair is whether it’s safe and whether it's actually being worked on.

Something that you won’t find at the usual collision repair facility is what Byers's company calls Carstar Vision. This lets you get a look at your car online from the beginning to the end of the repair process. You log in and can view photos of the progress of your vehicle repair.

Even so, he did not hand the keys to the sweet Audi prototype he was driving to a valet. Instead, he whipped out his smartphone and tapped it as he walked briskly and callously away from his now driverless car and into the hotel.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Dutifully, the unmanned Audi drove out of the hotel entryway and around the corner to the parking garage, where it negotiated the entry turnstile, located an empty parking space, and backed into it skillfully.

I assume it was tempted to chat on the phone and listen to its radio while it waited. But it didn’t.

Humans may not be ready to trust technology this much, parking structures lack the infrastructure, and so on. But parts of this technology will certainly be working their way into new cars slowly.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Cars are expensive, and there’s a general feeling that the odds of getting a good deal are stacked against the buyer. Huddy Skiba, sales manager at Hyman Bros. Mazda in Newport News, Virginia, says that when customers walk into a car dealership, they are \"terrified that they’re going to be ripped off. We’re just trying to help.\"","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"We want to help, too, so we’ve put together a few pieces of advice to help unravel the mysteries of shopping for your new car.

Naturally, shorter loans will have higher monthly payments but they'll also accrue less interest, so you’ll pay less overall by the time the loan is paid off. On the other hand, longer loans and lower monthly payments may be crucial to fitting a car into your budget. Even a seventy-two-month loan has become relatively common in these days of high car prices.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"What should really determine loan length is how long you plan to keep your car. Signing a five-year loan with low monthly payments may seem like a good idea, but if you’re planning on dumping your car for a newer model after two years, you’ll still have a large balance when you start shopping for a car again.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h4>Don't Let Yourself Go Upside Down</h4>\nThe key is to avoid owing more money than the car is worth. This is more likely to happen if you have a long loan and a high interest rate and make a small down payment because your vehicle’s value may depreciate faster than you can pay off the principal on your loan. This could cause problems if your insurance provider won’t cover the car for as much as you owe, or if you are looking to trade your car in and can’t negotiate a value that allows you to pay off your existing loan.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>The Moment of Truth: Heading into the Dealership</h4>\nWe’ve said this <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/videos/qa/new-car-state-of-mind/\" title=\"\"  target=\"_blank\">before</a>, but it bears repeating: if you did all your homework, made all your decisions, and you still can’t come to a reasonable agreement with your dealer, walk out. Buying a car is a big investment and not one that you should be pressured into. Take all the time you need to get a deal you feel comfortable with, and if you don’t think you can reach a deal with the salesperson you’re working with, ask for a different salesperson or find yourself a new dealer.  There’s no reason to be nervous, though. Skiba believes that buyers who have done their homework and walk into the dealership armed with plenty of information have every reason to expect a good deal.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"There’s a lot more to say about the process of buying a car.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Driving Tips","id":1034956,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-driving-tips","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1023763,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos/qa","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"All Videos","id":1023756,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-23T11:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"no-1-ladies-driving-academy","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52353279/ladies-promolarge.png","fileMasterId":52353279,"fileName":"ladies-promolarge.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-23T11:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"no-1-ladies-driving-academy","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52353276/Ladies-header.jpg","fileMasterId":52353276,"fileName":"Ladies-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-26T06:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"http://adam.automotive.com/default.aspx","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46391774/logo-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":46391774,"fileName":"logo-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":462962,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"I’ve been racking up to 100,000 miles a year since my late teenage years, when I was a taxicab owner/operator.

After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-29T10:53:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014-corvette-stingray-prices-out","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46291600/Corvette-Stingray-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":46291600,"fileName":"Corvette-Stingray-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-29T10:53:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014-corvette-stingray-prices-out","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46291594/Corvette-Stingray-header.jpg","fileMasterId":46291594,"fileName":"Corvette-Stingray-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-29T10:53:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014-corvette-stingray-prices-out","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52560414/Corvette-Stingray-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":52560414,"fileName":"Corvette-Stingray-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":463429,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"We’ve been enamored of the 2014 Corvette Stingray ever since we first laid eyes on it at the Detroit Auto Show in January<a href= http://www.jeanknowscars.com/features/style/detroit-auto-show-movie/ target=\"_blank\">,</a> but details on the target of our affection have been sketchy.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Soapbox","id":1034787,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/soapbox","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-10T12:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"auto racing 101","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52856865/Racing-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":52856865,"fileName":"Racing-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-10T12:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"auto racing 101","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52856856/Racing-header.jpg","fileMasterId":52856856,"fileName":"Racing-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":305},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":542}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-10T12:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"auto racing 101","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52856859/Racing-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":52856859,"fileName":"Racing-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":464393,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Auto racing is a fabulous spectacle, whether seen in person or on TV.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.
