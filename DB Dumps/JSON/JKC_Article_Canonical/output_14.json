I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

There were several Ford Lotus-Cortinas, Sunbeam Rapiers and Tigers and Alpines, a couple of Volvo PV544s, some Rileys, two Jowett Jupiters, three Lancia Aurelia B20s, and a stunning Lancia Aprilia.

There would be seven special timed speed sections including a lap of the Nurburgring, a visit to Hockenheim, and three hill-climbs.

I am no lithe, limber, leaping sprite. Especially not in a five-point safety harness. We placed eleventh, beaten by Paddy Hopkirk in his Mini Cooper, Timo Makinen in his Victor Gauntlett-owned Austin-Healey 3000, two other Austin-Healeys and another Mini, a Lotus-Cortina, a Jaguar E-type, a Triumph Vitesse, and two other MGBs.

We smoked everyone around us and found out later that only the number 75 Austin-Healey 3000 of John Chatham was faster. We also noted that we tied for second with the number 107 Ford Lotus-Cortina of Piggy Thompson and Eddie Ganderton, who had knocked down the fastest penalty-free run at the Hoverport.

If it weren’t for Stirling’s knowledge of the track (he described each turn in advance as he flew around), we would have finished much worse than thirteenth fastest.

But for now, as we drove across rural Germany, the hills were small, and the sky was so blue it looked fake. Stirling prayed for rain as we got our first real glimpse of the Alps from Fussen.  We had 100 miles of serious snow-capped peaks before we reached our stop for the night in Merano, Italy. The last was the Passo del Rombo, at 8,232 feet, with an Italian customs booth at the top. It was the first (but not the last) time Stirling’s driving style really grabbed my attention. He had been flying along, which doesn’t bother me, and to save the brakes in the mountains, he had been using the throttle and steering wheel rather flamboyantly in concert with the understeer. <em>That</em> didn’t bother me.

","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"“Go, go, go!” I hollered, and we were heading down the other side. Which scared me worse. There were the dark, narrow, slimy tunnels. There was a tiny road slashing back and forth down the mountain, so narrow that at one point a truck had to reverse for a half-mile to let a bus past. There were the <em>carabinieri</em>, chasing us in a Land Rover, which didn’t stop Stirling from passing Paddy’s Mini Cooper on a piece of road barely big enough for both cars. Navigator Alec Poole was at the wheel.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"“It’s good to do that, even if Paddy wasn’t driving,” said Stirling. “It’s a mental thing.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"I said nothing.

Stirling passed them back.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":19,"text":"I was actually becoming used to Stirling’s aversion to following other cars. It wasn’t the passing that took adjustment as much as the shouting and waving that accompanied every single pass. If the party to be overtaken moved over promptly, he was rewarded with a hand wave from Stirling. Any resistance and Stirling would lay on the horn, wave his fist menacingly, and shout insults as he went by.

More exciting than the drive was seeing forth-place Paddy along the way, leaning against his dead Mini. But the true excitement happened on the way down. Not to us, but to Roger and Margaret Ealand in a lovely red 1965 E-type Jaguar.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Mr. and Mrs. Ealand had had quite a ball running up the Stelvio, and at the top, Mister confided to Missus that this was for him.

CARE—some very narrow,” they crashed heavily, mangling their pretty Jag. Rally officials nearby helped them move the car from the tunnel and to the side of the road, which also happened to be the side of the cliff. A flatbed truck came by, and as the truck driver and Mr. Ealand attempted to pull the Jaguar aboard, Mr. Ealand’s rope snapped, and he pitched off the side of the cliff. Mrs. Ealand fainted dead away.

After a mad scramble for fuel (during which Stirling had to shout in Italian at two gas stations' worth of attendants to get served during off hours), we found our road—a tiny, barely paved piece of nothing wriggling up through the forest and bounded by a thin little wooden slat guardrail. Except where it was missing.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"We came around one bend and were stopped cold by an eathmover completely blocking the way. Stirling leapt from the car and, wasting no niceties, shouted in Italian, the gist of which was “important race,” “no time,” and probably a few motivational words learned from his race mechanics back in the old days. I was mortified. They shouted back. He shouted louder. They caved in. We were through.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"We hit the Passo di Gavia summit—a spectacular expanse of high snow fields with a 360-degree view of jagged mountain ranges—at a dead run.

We looked at each other and swore in our native tongues. Nothing could be worse, we thought. It could. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"We had to drive fifty-five kilometers through small villages, negotiate the Passo di Vivione, and descend to Borno.

We expected the ride down to cool the engine, but the needle stayed pegged. A well by the side of the road caught Stirling’s eye, and he pulled off.

Large SUVs or vans are the obvious choice for transporting bikes, but hatchbacks can have just as much cargo space with the seats down, can get better fuel economy, and are typically cheaper than full-size SUVs.

After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Tech News","id":1034781,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/car-tech-news","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-06T09:58:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Volt 300","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46636307/Volt-300.jpg","fileMasterId":46636307,"fileName":"Volt-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-06T09:58:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Volt Solar Charge 622","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46636310/Volt-Solar-Charge-622.jpg","fileMasterId":46636310,"fileName":"Volt-Solar-Charge-622.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":621}}},"pages":[{"id":464115,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"How much should auto companies show they care about global warming?

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-11T05:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 honda civic si","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47668367/Honda-Civic-Si-PromoLarge-w.jpg","fileMasterId":47668367,"fileName":"Honda-Civic-Si-PromoLarge-w.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-11T06:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 honda civic si","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47595820/Honda-Civic-Si-header-3.jpg","fileMasterId":47595820,"fileName":"Honda-Civic-Si-header-3.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-06T11:09:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 honda civic si","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47383237/Honda-Civic-Si-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":47383237,"fileName":"Honda-Civic-Si-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":467276,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>The Car:</h3>\n<strong>Price:</strong> $25,005 as tested (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.4-Liter DOHC 16-valve i-VTEC four-cylinder, 201 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed manual<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 22 mpg city/31 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard features:</strong> Rearview camera, Bluetooth hands-free link, USB audio interface, side curtain airbags with rollover sensor, Pandora Internet radio interface, fold-flat rear seats<br>\n<strong>Option(s) I can’t live without:</strong> XM Satellite radio (free for the first three months)","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2013 honda civic si","caption":"","fileMasterId":47383267,"fileName":"Honda_Civic_Si_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47383267/Honda_Civic_Si_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":1,"text":"<h3>What I Think:</h3>\nThe Honda Civic is well known as the kind of car that a non-car-loving person would go for.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Fast Women","id":1034957,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know/fast-women","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[{"articleId":341607,"name":"article0","promoImage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-31T09:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"mean jeans humiliation","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47181580/MeanJean-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":47181580,"fileName":"MeanJean-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"promoTeaser":"I don't mind being beaten on the autocross circuit by a girl.

But the sub-$20,000 base model is also sub-140 horsepower, and I’d heard it wasn’t particularly fun to drive. But wait! The advent of the 2013 model year brought with it a turbocharged version, which kicks the base Veloster’s 138 horsepower and 132 pound-feet of torque up to 201 hp and 195 pound-feet of torque.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-08T14:22:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"great lakes swimapalooza","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58700028/swimapalooza-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":58700028,"fileName":"swimapalooza-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-09T10:51:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Swimapalooza","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58722819/swim-header.png","fileMasterId":58722819,"fileName":"swim-header.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-08T14:22:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"great lakes swimapalooza","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58700028/swimapalooza-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":58700028,"fileName":"swimapalooza-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":541946,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"great lakes swimapalooza","caption":"","fileMasterId":57232618,"fileName":"swimapalooza_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57232618/swimapalooza_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":393},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"My family and I went on an unusual journey at the end of the summer: we successfully swam in all five of the Great Lakes in just one day.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-26T15:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 mercedes benz c250","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59502447/meredes-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":59502447,"fileName":"meredes-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-26T15:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 mercedes benz c250","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54149693/c250-7-8.jpg","fileMasterId":54149693,"fileName":"c250-7-8.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-26T15:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 mercedes benz c250","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59502447/meredes-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":59502447,"fileName":"meredes-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":544369,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>The Car:</h3>\n<strong>Price:</strong> $42,775 as tested (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 1.8 liter turbocharged inline 4 engine with direct injection<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> 7-speed automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 22 mpg city/31 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> mbrace2<br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Dynamic Sport package ($3,050)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Audi A4/S4, BMW 3 Series, Cadillac XTS, Infiniti Q60 (formerly Infiniti G), Lexus IS","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"See more specs on the Mercedes-Benz C-Class in our <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/mercedes-benz/c-class/\" target=\"_blank\">Car Guide.</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2013 mercedes benz c250","caption":"","fileMasterId":54149819,"fileName":"c250_rear_seats.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54149819/c250_rear_seats.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":398},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":2,"text":"C does not stand for cookie in the case of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, but it may stand for cowbell.

I think it's worth the price to have a runner in your driveway, even if you're usually only going to go out for a mild stroll.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Mercedes-Benz C250","fileMasterId":54150203,"fileName":"c_250_side.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54150203/c_250_side.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Mercedes-Benz C250, interior detail.","fileMasterId":59502444,"fileName":"C250_interior.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59502444/C250_interior.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Mercedes-Benz C250, interior detail.","fileMasterId":54149822,"fileName":"c250_shifter.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54149822/c250_shifter.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Mercedes-Benz C250 with red seatbelts and trim.","fileMasterId":54149819,"fileName":"c250_rear_seats.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54149819/c250_rear_seats.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":398},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Mercedes-Benz C250","fileMasterId":59502438,"fileName":"c250_front_1.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59502438/c250_front_1.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Mercedes-Benz C250","fileMasterId":54149780,"fileName":"IMG_2617c250_rear_crop.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54149780/IMG_2617c250_rear_crop.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Mercedes-Benz C250","fileMasterId":54149777,"fileName":"c250_rear.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54149777/c250_rear.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":12,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":33131,"make":"Mercedes-Benz","model":"C-Class","year":2013},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:32:07.030-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547527031 }} },{ "_id":405953,"title":"The Weekly Windup","subTitle":"","slug":"the-weekly-windup-10-4-13","promoTitle":"The Weekly Windup","promoTeaserSmall":"More glorious randomness and fascinating things to click on.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-04T14:15:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"the weekly windup 10 4 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59774718/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59774718,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-04T14:15:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"the weekly windup 10 4 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59774715/weekly-header.jpg","fileMasterId":59774715,"fileName":"weekly-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-04T14:15:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"the weekly windup 10 4 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59774718/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59774718,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":545414,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Some things we ran across on the way to finding what we were looking for.

The Government Should Mandate Rearview Cameras</h3>\n<h4>Laura Sky Brown, Executive Editor (That's me on the left)</h4>\nHave you used a rearview camera yet? They're becoming more common, and having used several in test cars, I now resent any vehicle I get into that doesn't have one. They're definitely on the list of things, like the iPhone and Vitamin Water Zero, that I never knew I needed but, having tried them, can no longer live without. The camera shows an image on your dashboard monitor (or sometimes your rearview mirror) of what's behind the car. The best part is the set of helpful lines that go from green to yellow to red as you get closer to that pole or curb behind you.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Just this morning, in fact, I climbed into a Dodge Avenger and put it in reverse, without the help of a rearview image. I was backing out of a diagonal parking space and had already clearly seen that the coast was clear and there was no chance anyone was anywhere nearby to walk behind me. Still, I just felt at a disadvantage, without a rearview camera in place, using the traditional mirrors and turning my head to the back. Those cameras show you the full picture of what’s behind you, and I don’t feel as good about doing without them now that the technology exists, even though I do know how to back up without one.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Government-mandated safety standards are undoubtedly controversial. Is it Big Brother to require motorcycle helmets? Seatbelts? Those high-mounted brake lights on the back of cars, which became a requirement with the 1986 model year? How about airbags? So, how about rearview cameras? ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"Yes, how about them. I am all in favor of seeing a law go into effect that makes car companies provide them, especially on big SUVs that ride high up off the ground, to make sure the driver can see small children behind the vehicle—but on any kind of car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>No! The Government Should Not Mandate Rearview Cameras, and Here's Why Not</h3>\n<h4>Molly Jean, Senior Editor (That's me on the right)</h4>\n \nI am a believer in choice. I agree with everything Laura says about the rearview camera, but I think it should be up to car buyers to decide whether or not they want to purchase it. When will the nanny state stop? A navigation system could also be considered a safety product by helping to keep the driver’s eyes on the road. Should the government mandate a navigation system in every car?\n \nI think the safest backup method is to walk around your car before slipping into the driver’s seat, and then to actually swivel around to view what is behind you as you slowly back up. I also know that some individuals, such as some older people, have a difficult time turning to look behind them and could really benefit from a rearview camera. But I still believe the individual should make the decision on whether one is needed.\n \nI have been lucky enough to drive many cars that are equipped with a rearview camera, and in fact the car I own has one. But it was not one of my requirements, like the heated seats were. Because I have been driving for over twenty years, it is not second nature for me to use the screen as I back up, so I rarely even remember I have one. But my teenage driver relies on it, especially when parallel parking.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"At my husband’s job, employees were required to take a <a href=\"http://www.smith-system.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Smith System</a> driving safety course. The program has a whole segment of the curriculum that focuses on reducing backup collisions. It's true that the amount of time that drivers spend backing up is minuscule compared with how much time they spend driving forward, yet a high number of collisions happen while reversing. The Smith System advocates for always backing into parking spots and grabbing pull-through spots whenever possible. Basically, the idea is to eliminate those blind-backup times altogether.<br>     \n <br>\nThe bottom line is that a driver needs to be alert at all times, and especially while reversing. The rearview camera is a great tool, but I would like to be the one to make the decision on whether it is worth the investment.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>Related story:</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/cool-tech/car-safety/rearview-camera-fight/\" target=\"_blank\">The Rearview Camera Fight</a>: Should backup cameras be required?

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-29T11:21:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"r8_contest_homepage","title":"audi r8 contest","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55946090/r8-contest-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":55946090,"fileName":"r8-contest-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-29T11:21:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"r8_contest_header","title":"audi r8 contest","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55946087/r8-contest-header.jpg","fileMasterId":55946087,"fileName":"r8-contest-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-29T11:21:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"r8_contest_homepage","title":"audi r8 contest","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55946090/r8-contest-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":55946090,"fileName":"r8-contest-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":571103,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"drive an audi r8","caption":"","fileMasterId":61918620,"fileName":"R8_contest_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61918620/R8_contest_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"If you’re an Audi fan, you probably already know about the brand’s recurring #WantAnR8 Twitter campaign, a contest that gives enthusiasts the chance to win seat time in the Audi R8, a V-10-powered supercar, with a price that can top out close to $200,000.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-29T11:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"halloween_homepage","title":"our halloween playlist","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55948556/Halloween-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":55948556,"fileName":"Halloween-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":366},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":750}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-29T11:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"halloween_header","title":"our halloween playlist","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55948547/Halloween-header.jpg","fileMasterId":55948547,"fileName":"Halloween-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-29T11:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"halloween_homepage","title":"our halloween playlist","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55948556/Halloween-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":55948556,"fileName":"Halloween-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":366},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":750}}},"pages":[{"id":571109,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"What we like about Halloween is that it's okay for anybody to dress up in a costume and eat candy.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-25T18:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"hyundai-rock-homepage","title":"hyundai santa fe to rock hall","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63768252/hyundai-rock-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63768252,"fileName":"hyundai-rock-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-25T18:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"hyundai-rock-12","title":"hyundai santa fe to rock hall","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57622982/hyundai-rock-12.jpg","fileMasterId":57622982,"fileName":"hyundai-rock-12.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-25T18:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"hyundai-rock-homepage","title":"hyundai santa fe to rock hall","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63768252/hyundai-rock-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63768252,"fileName":"hyundai-rock-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":592021,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"hyundai santa fe to rock hall","caption":"","fileMasterId":57622949,"fileName":"hyundai-rock-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57622949/hyundai-rock-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"The 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe was our home away from home on a family jaunt to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

These are properties that have been decimated from years of pasturing horses, cattle, and goats.  He shows me pup tents, where deer are photographed and counted.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-08T12:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"toyota-land-cruiser-homepage2","title":"2013 toyota highlander on the road","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66577593/toyota-land-cruiser-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":66577593,"fileName":"toyota-land-cruiser-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-08T12:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"toyota-land-cruiser-header","title":"2013 toyota highlander on the road","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66577569/toyota-land-cruiser-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66577569,"fileName":"toyota-land-cruiser-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-08T12:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"toyota-land-cruiser-homepage2","title":"2013 toyota highlander on the road","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66577593/toyota-land-cruiser-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":66577593,"fileName":"toyota-land-cruiser-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":596701,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Price:</strong> $78,555 base price of this model<br>\n$79,728 as tested (including destination) <br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 5.7-liter V-8, 381 horsepower, 401 pound-feet of torque, full-time four-wheel drive<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed automatic transmission with sequential shift mode and uphill/downhill shift <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 13 mpg city/18 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong>Center console cooler<br>\n<strong>Options I can’t live without:</strong> all-weather floor and carpet mats ($250), remote starter ($425), ball mount and trailer ball ($98)<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Multi-terrain select, hill start control, crawl control with off-road turn assist, multi-terrain monitor, DVD rear entertainment system<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Cadillac Escalade, Land Rover Range Rover, Mercedes-Benz GL-Class<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"For me, winter calls for a vehicle that can handle snow, haul a lot of people, and cover many miles comfortably.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Fast Women","id":1034957,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/fast-women","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-21T18:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"dakar-homepage","title":"women of the dakar rally","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60894650/dakar-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":60894650,"fileName":"dakar-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-21T18:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"dakar-01","title":"women of the dakar rally","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67422840/dakar-01.jpg","fileMasterId":67422840,"fileName":"dakar-01.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-21T18:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"dakar-homepage","title":"women of the dakar rally","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60894650/dakar-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":60894650,"fileName":"dakar-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":601249,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>I was there when they departed before dawn on Sunday, January 5,</strong> steering through the throng of spectators who had stayed all night near Argentina’s national flag memorial to see them off.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-3-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 3","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664472/insurance-3-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67664472,"fileName":"insurance-3-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-3-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 3","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664472/insurance-3-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67664472,"fileName":"insurance-3-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-3-header","title":"insurance tip no 3","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664469/insurance-3-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67664469,"fileName":"insurance-3-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-3-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 3","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664472/insurance-3-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67664472,"fileName":"insurance-3-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":616267,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Most people assume that car insurance protects a depreciating asset (the vehicle).

I like to interview them, learn about their lives, photograph them, and write their stories. The people at Jean Knows Cars noticed me through my project, Humans of Ann Arbor. In that project, I tool around the city of Ann Arbor, introducing myself to anyone who draws my eye. If they are open to it, I take a photo of them and hear a little bit about them. Then I post the photos and stories on Facebook. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/HumansofAnnArbor\" rel=\"”nofollow”\" target=\"”_blank”\">Humans  of Ann  Arbor</a>  has followers from all over the world who check in on a daily basis to see ordinary people and their extraordinary stories.\n\nI have been studying people since I was a little girl in Missouri. Where I grew up, studying people often led you to the cars they loved. My grandpa had a gas station in Claycomo, Missouri, which he opened in the 1950s, and he passed his love of cars and taking care of the people who drove them down to my dad. Dad was a mechanic and a service supervisor all his life. We had a steady barrage of cars coming into our lives…mostly Chevys. To impress my dad, I learned to identify every car I could, and I used to name the cars while we drove down the road. Car culture is big in Missouri. Would you believe that I had friends who were sisters named Nova and Chevelle? If\nyou didn’t grow up the way I did, you might not get the significance of that, but suffice it to say that my people love their cars.\n\nThe car I adored most was the Chevrolet Corvair my dad gave me when I was in high school. It spent more time in my dad's shop than it did on the road, but in those moments when it was drivable, I knew what it was to love a car. It was a thing of beauty: pale cream with a plaid madras interior. I loved the sound and feel of the engine…it was more like a soft purr than a roar. I can still remember how it smelled and what it was like to drive it with the windows rolled down on a warm day. I've had lots of cars since then, and I loved some of them, too. But the Corvair was my first car love and will always be my favorite.\n\nAfter high school, I drove my car to Springfield, Missouri, to study communications at Missouri State. Later, I drove a different car to Chicago to study photography at Columbia College. I worked in Chicago as a freelance photographer and studio manager for many years before moving to Ann Arbor, where I continue to do freelance photography. I am excited about combining my love of studying people with my interest in cars. I want to explore how cars serve us, how they are intertwined in our lives, and what makes us love them. I can't wait to let you know what I find out.","fileMasterId":66360111,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66360111/66360111.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-24T07:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"humans-homepage","title":"humans of the auto show","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61014785/humans-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61014785,"fileName":"humans-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-24T07:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"humans-header","title":"humans of the auto show","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67522122/humans-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67522122,"fileName":"humans-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":499}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-24T07:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"humans-homepage","title":"humans of the auto show","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61014785/humans-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61014785,"fileName":"humans-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":616276,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"I was so happy when Jean Knows Cars asked me to go to the North American International Auto Show and take a look around.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now.

Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact.

Fuel savings are a Civic calling card, and several trims are available with creative ways to up the mpg from the aerodynamic HF to an electric Hybrid or a natural gas hybrid. The interior of this historically well received compact is where the improvements really stand out. Thanks to acoustic glass and other noise-dampening materials, the ride is quieter than ever before.  Changes from the staid and sometimes cheap-feeling 2012 model include an updated interior color palette, refashioned vents, and higher-quality seat coverings. Technology upgrades are available to navigate, monitor your blind spot, connect to Apple’s Siri Eyes Free,  and increase fuel efficiency.  While it’s no performance vehicle, it has an improved feel between the steering and the road that previous Civic owners will appreciate.

Of course, different doesn’t have to be bad, as the Ridgeline stands out from other pickups on the market with a design that gives it the air of an SUV with a chunk missing.  It bucks another pickup tradition by being the only mid-size truck on the market with a cab and truck bed built in one piece, meaning that the sections don’t bounce around separately while driving.  This gives the Ridgeline a smoother ride than most of its rivals, while still maintaining the convenience of an open-bed truck. It is, however, significantly more expensive than many of its competitors, with a base price range in the $30,000s. The Ridgeline has a one choice of engine, a 250-horsepower V-6, and is rated to tow 5,000 pounds. Another desirable feature is the standard four-wheel drive. It has four doors and two rows of seats, so the Ridgeline can seat five, although the cabin is not appointed quite as well as the rest of Honda’s fleet.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-12T11:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"3-7-2014-homepage","title":"weekly windup 3 14","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69603201/3-7-2014-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69603201,"fileName":"3-7-2014-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-12T11:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"3-7-2014-homepage","title":"weekly windup 3 14","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69603201/3-7-2014-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69603201,"fileName":"3-7-2014-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-12T11:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"3-7-2014-header","title":"weekly windup 3 14","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69603198/3-7-2014-header.jpg","fileMasterId":69603198,"fileName":"3-7-2014-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-12T11:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"3-7-2014-homepage","title":"weekly windup 3 14","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69603201/3-7-2014-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69603201,"fileName":"3-7-2014-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":638239,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"weekly windup 3 7","caption":"","fileMasterId":63610022,"fileName":"3-7-2014-wrx.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63610022/3-7-2014-wrx.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>1.</strong> Subaru WRX STI vs. Stick Bomb: I had never heard of a StickBomb, but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvQ9InhEKu0\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">now</a> I am obsessed. \n See the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXOhyn1Lq54\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">behind-the-scenes video</a>; it is just as mesmerizing. <br>\n<br>\nNow you need to see the <a href=\"http://www.lunatim.com/kinart/stickhistory.htm\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">details</a> on StickBombs.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>2.</strong> Sinkhole Saga: You can follow the recovery process from the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/corvettemuseum\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sinkhole at the Corvette Museum</a>.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

It’s not hard to make a—you should excuse the expression—short list. The problem is in deciding on the many tradeoffs. There’s no shortage of cars in the subcompact segment and even the sub-subcompact niche. You’ve got your Mini Coopers, which are charming and sporty. But they can be as expensive as a much larger car, putting them more in the category of a second or third car to own for fun. If you’re going small at least partly to be frugal and not just to be fashionable, it might be out of your price range. You’ve got your Smart Fortwo, which is undeniably cheap and fuel-efficient but comically tiny; the Scion iQ and Fiat 500 are a little more reasonable—but only a little. Going up a bit in size, you’ll find the Honda Fit and the Toyota Yaris, which have more of a standard silhouette, along with decent-size engines and horsepower—but lower fuel economy to match.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"And then there’s the Chevrolet Spark. This is a car that straddles the tiny space between these other tiny cars. You get your cheap price and your fuel economy; you enjoy a certain amount of sporty style. Yet you don’t feel like you’ve been folded up inside a suitcase. As my eighteen-year-old son Henry exclaimed the first time he climbed in, “It’s actually like a real car inside!”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"How much like a real car? To find out, Henry and I embarked on a 200-mile round trip visit to that arbiter of all purchase wisdom, my dad.

Yes, we careened up I-94 through pothole-rich Detroit in a Spark. It was an adventure! I did try to psych myself out a bit by murmuring to myself, “This is a normal-size car. This is a normal-size car. This is just as big as the other cars around me.” It was okay; Henry had his earphones in.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2013 chevrolet spark 2lt","caption":"","fileMasterId":58496752,"fileName":"chevy_spark_06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58496752/chevy_spark_06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":4,"text":"Seriously, though, the Spark was capable of meeting and even exceeding the 70-mph speed limit, providing as smooth a ride and as strong a performance as you have any right to expect from a 2,237-pound car on a 93.5-inch wheelbase with an 84-horsepower engine under the cute little hood. The five-speed manual transmission was smooth and enjoyable to use once we exited onto the surface roads of our destination. (<em>Consumer Reports</em> said the manual is to be preferred over the jerky automatic in this car, but I didn't try the automatic-transmission version, so I couldn't judge.)","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"And when we hauled ourselves up onto the solid ground of my dad’s driveway, what do you suppose his reaction was?

Sure enough, the next morning we headed out to the Four Star, our favorite breakfast joint, and I enjoyed the feeling of parking the Spark next to a mammoth-looking Honda Accord and having plenty of room inside the white lines. My colleagues thought the front seating area was narrow and cramped. That didn't bother me, and it was no problem for my eighty-five-year-old father to get in or to get comfortable inside. Plus, he was impressed by the fuel economy numbers and the low price.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"But Frank Brown is not the target demographic: This South Korea-sourced Chevrolet is the first minicar the GM division brought to North America, and it’s marketed for “young city dwellers.” Accordingly, it has a lot of electronics for such a small car. The standard MyLink infotainment system has a seven-inch screen, Bluetooth streaming audio,  SiriusXM satellite radio, and embedded Pandora and Stitcher apps. Henry figured it all out instantly and had nothing but praise for the display and the ease of use.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"The Spark also spares you from some of the penalty details you’d have a right to expect from an entry-level car: there are power windows on all trim levels,  it has a flip-and-fold rear seat that opens up 31.2 cubic feet of storage space in back, and GM’s StabiliTrak system with traction control and brake assist is standard. There’s even a rear spoiler.  And when I took three members of the Jean Knows Cars team on an outing, it seated us all in pleasant comfort. (In the photo at top, you can see how well Annie White fit in the back seat, even though she’s way taller than I am.)","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"Henry complimented the Spark’s looks compared with, say, the Smart or the Scion, and he’s got a point.

That almost makes up for the Oreo-cookie-size fifteen-inch wheels.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"Why all the candy metaphors?

You need to do some soul-searching first. Are you really prepared to drive something this small? Yes, four people do fit pretty nicely. There’s a decent amount of storage space. It’s not that this is not a functional and even a nice car. I’m talking about how it will feel, day in and day out, to be in a car that’s notably smaller than the other traffic around you. If that feels okay to you, and especially if you have already worked that out and are actively city-car shopping, don’t pick one based on trendy ads or word of mouth alone. The Chevy Spark may not be the hippest nameplate out there, but don’t make your final choice until you’ve had a spin in this one.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"<h3>Peanut Gallery:</h3> \n<strong>Molly:</strong> On my first drive in the Spark, I kept mistakenly starting out in third gear. Then I realized that because first and second gears are so far left the armrest was getting in my way. Once I quit using the armrest, the gear pattern was much easier. However, driving a car this tiny with a manual can be a problem for the front seat passenger. I kept having to remind my daughter to leave me room to shift. Its sensibility reminds me of the Chevette: great price, reasonably cute, fun to drive. I will be interested to see how this little spark plug does in NHTSA's crash tests.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<strong>Annie:</strong> The Spark has a lot going for it—unique styling, good fuel economy, good infotainment—but its main characteristic will always be its diminutive size. The car is so narrow that the steering wheel obscures the driver's view of the center console, and two adults sitting in the front row will be bumping elbows. I wouldn't buy a Spark because I'm more likely  to take four people on a road trip than I am to try to squeeze into a subcompact parallel parking space, but for city dwellers who can't get by with Zipcar, the Spark could be just the econobox they're looking for.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Chevrolet Spark 2LT.","fileMasterId":58496752,"fileName":"chevy_spark_06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58496752/chevy_spark_06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Chevrolet Spark 2LT: rear door detail.","fileMasterId":58496746,"fileName":"chevy_spark_04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58496746/chevy_spark_04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Chevrolet Spark 2LT interior.","fileMasterId":58496743,"fileName":"chevy_spark_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58496743/chevy_spark_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Chevrolet Spark 2LT interior.","fileMasterId":58496740,"fileName":"chevy_spark_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58496740/chevy_spark_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Chevrolet Spark 2LT interior.","fileMasterId":58496737,"fileName":"chevy_spark_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58496737/chevy_spark_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Chevrolet Spark 2LT.","fileMasterId":58497823,"fileName":"chevy_spark_10.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58497823/chevy_spark_10.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Chevrolet Spark 2LT","fileMasterId":58497820,"fileName":"chevy_spark_07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58497820/chevy_spark_07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":47,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:33:22.211-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547602213 }} },{ "_id":405913,"title":"The Rearview Camera Fight","subTitle":"","slug":"rearview-camera-fight","promoTitle":"The Rearview Camera Fight","promoTeaserSmall":"Should backup cameras be required?

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-18T07:50:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"weekly_homepage","title":"the weekly windup 10 18 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59001193/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59001193,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-18T07:50:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"weekly_header","title":"the weekly windup 10 18 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59001190/weekly-header.jpg","fileMasterId":59001190,"fileName":"weekly-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-18T07:50:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"weekly_homepage","title":"the weekly windup 10 18 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59001193/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59001193,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":546882,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Here are a few things we ran across on the way to finding what we were looking for.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her.

Who knew that the Scottish population is so large in Detroit that they have been organized since 1849? Underneath Saint Andrew's Hall is The Shelter, which also hosts live music. It is credited with being one of Eminem’s first venues. And looks it.<br>\n<br>\nTom was more worried about lights on our bikes than whether he should dress up as a superhero or a gangster.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-18T06:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"flipper","title":"Mercedes Benz CLA250","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61818871/Flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":61818871,"fileName":"Flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":648}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-18T06:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"header","title":"Mercedes Benz CLA250","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61818868/HEADER.jpg","fileMasterId":61818868,"fileName":"HEADER.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-18T06:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"flipper","title":"Mercedes Benz CLA250","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61818871/Flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":61818871,"fileName":"Flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":648}}},"pages":[{"id":591197,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>Vital Stats</h3>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $30,825 (includes destination)<br>\n<strong>This car’s price:</strong> $43,245 (includes destination)<br>\n<strong>EPA fuel economy:</strong> 26 mpg city/38 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, 208 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Seven-speed automatic with shift paddles<br>\n<strong>Safety features:</strong> Collision Prevention Assist (anticipates a crash and initiates braking), Attention Assist (checks steering and detects drowsiness, issuing an alarm), eight airbags, rearview camera, stability control, traction control; Driver Assistance package ($2,500) includes blind spot assist, Distronic Plus brake assist, lane keeping assist; rear-seat side airbags are optional<br>\n<strong>Tech features:</strong> Eco Start-Stop, Bluetooth, mbrace2 telematics, bi-xenon headlights<br>\n<strong>Chief competitors:</strong> Acura ILX, Audi A3, BMW 1 Series, Volkswagen CC<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/PQOOPmeOrgw?list=UUKWoLlV8-sE8zQnoWHI9qoA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Mercedes Benz CLA250","caption":"","fileMasterId":61818856,"fileName":"MB-Interior.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61818856/MB-Interior.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":2,"text":"<h3>Key Points</h3>\n•  This all-new entry-level car for Mercedes-Benz slots below the C-Class.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-30T07:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-accord-coupe-homepage","title":"2014 honda accord coupe","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66220812/honda-accord-coupe-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66220812,"fileName":"honda-accord-coupe-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-30T07:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-accord-coupe-header","title":"2014 honda accord coupe","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66220809/honda-accord-coupe-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66220809,"fileName":"honda-accord-coupe-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-30T07:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-accord-coupe-homepage","title":"2014 honda accord coupe","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66220812/honda-accord-coupe-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66220812,"fileName":"honda-accord-coupe-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":595672,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2014 Honda Accord Coupe EX-L V6 Navi</h3>\r\n<h3>Vital Stats</h3>\r\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $31,415 (includes destination)<br>\r\n<strong>This car's price:</strong> $33,190 (includes destination)<br>\r\n<strong>EPA fuel economy:</strong> 18 mpg city/28 mpg highway<br>\r\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.5-liter V-6, 278 horsepower<br>\r\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed manual<br>\r\n<strong>Safety features:</strong> Six airbags, vehicle stability assist with traction control, forward collision warning, and lane departure warning (all standard)<br>\r\n<strong>Tech features:</strong> Touchscreen audio, SiriusXM satellite radio, push-button start, MP3 and USB connectivity, heated front seats<br>\r\n<strong>Chief competitors:</strong> This is one of the few cars that stands alone in its segment.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/-jk8KnLSBjs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>Key Points</h3>\r\n• The 2014 Accord Coupe is a carryover model.<br>\r\n•  The car shown in the video is the top-of-the-line Accord Coupe model, and it has no options.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other.

Putting your teenager in charge of a multi-thousand-pound vehicle may not be the easiest thing you’ve ever done, but it is almost inevitable. And the good news is that even when you’re not in the car with them, you can have a big impact on their driving habits, according to a study released this month by Travelers, the insurance provider. Keep reading for some surprising findings from the study, and tips on how to talk to your kids about safe driving.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>1. Be a Good Role Model</h3>\r\nTravelers found that teens who reported that their parents were good driving role models were half as likely to have been in an accident as teens whose parents weren’t setting a good example. That’s good news, but it’s also a big responsibility. So when your kids are in the car, make an extra effort to drive safely and courteously–and hands off the cell phone.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>2. Start a Conversation. Soon.</h3>\nIn their survey of 2,000 teens and parents, Travelers found that two-thirds of sixteen-year-olds wanted to have a conversation about driving safety with their parents, and half of those kids were waiting for their parents to initiate the conversation. By the time young drivers are eighteen, however, that window of opportunity is nearly closed. Just 29 percent of surveyed eighteen-year-olds were interested in a safe-driving talk with their parents. Don’t shy away from the talk; start a dialogue with your kids before they lose interest.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"Be sure that your kids know not only how dangerous it is to drink or text behind the wheel, but feel empowered to refuse rides from peers who aren’t driving safely.","type":"blockquote"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>3. Don’t Be Naïve</h3>\nTravelers found a surprising disconnect in the driving behaviors that parents and teens are concerned about. While the majority of teens–66 percent–were concerned about driving under the influence, just 14 percent of parents thought of it as a major concern. Mobile phone use while driving concerned 56 percent of teenagers but just 35 percent of parents, despite heavy media coverage of the dangers of distracted driving. You may not be worried about these behaviors because you think your teen knows better than to engage in them, but you should include impaired and distracted driving in your safe-driving talk anyway. Be sure that your kids know not only how dangerous it is to drink or text behind the wheel, but that they feel empowered to refuse rides from peers who aren’t driving safely.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>4. Make a Driving Contract</h3>  \r\nActing as a good driving role model and having a frank, open conversation with your teens about safe driving will go a long way, but they can’t be your last steps. To cement the agreements you and your new driver have made, think about drawing up a driving contract with your teen. Talk about forbidden behaviors, curfews, the number of passengers they’re allowed to carry, and anything else that’s important to you.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>5. Have Consequences and Stick to Them</h3>\nYou should also agree on consequences for broken rules, so the contract has some teeth.

Tires</h3>\n Maintaining proper traction is a challenge in winter conditions, so if you live where there is heavy snow, consider purchasing snow tires for the season. If you're counting on all-season tires to get you through, they won't be as useful if you have let the tread wear down. “If any tire has less than 3/32 inch of tread,” cautions Calkins, “it should be replaced.”  Also, tire pressure drops along with temperatures, so make sure yours are properly inflated.  Appropriate PSI for your tires can be found on the driver’s door frame, or check your owner's manual.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"winter maintenance 4 musts","caption":"","fileMasterId":66920701,"fileName":"winter-maint-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66920701/winter-maint-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":2,"text":"<h3>2. Battery</h3>\nBatteries become less efficient with colder temperatures so if your charge wasn’t optimal in the first place you may have trouble starting the car once the winter chill begins in earnest.

Brakes</h3>\nOn icy roads, we put an almost unreasonable amount of faith in our brakes.  Give yours a fighting chance by having them checked.  Calkins reminds us, “Brakes that tend to grab or pull on dry roads are likely to lock on ice or snow-covered pavement, resulting in a loss of stopping power and/or steering control.”  So, if you had questions about your brakes in the summer, don’t bet on them getting you safely through the winter months.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"winter maintenance 4 musts","caption":"","fileMasterId":66920704,"fileName":"winter-maint-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66920704/winter-maint-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":4,"text":"<h3>4.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Alt Fuel","id":1034784,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/car-alt-fuel","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-06T09:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"kia-soul-ev-flipper","title":"Kia Soul EV","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61844312/Kia-Soul-EV-Flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":61844312,"fileName":"Kia-Soul-EV-Flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-06T09:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"soul-header","title":"Soul Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66519973/Soul-Header.jpg","fileMasterId":66519973,"fileName":"Soul-Header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-06T10:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"soul-ev-flipper","title":"Soul EV Flipper","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61849520/Soul-EV-Flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":61849520,"fileName":"Soul-EV-Flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}}},"pages":[{"id":618113,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Chicagoas","caption":"","fileMasterId":66531421,"fileName":"chicagoas.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66531421/chicagoas.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":396},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"We were just talking about the <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/2014-kia-soul/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Kia Soul</a> at Jean Knows Cars, and days after our review of the 2014 model, the automaker has rolled out a new version.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Fast Women","id":1034957,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know/fast-women","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-18T12:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lafemme-homepage","title":"dodge la femme","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62285903/lafemme-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62285903,"fileName":"lafemme-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-18T12:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"la-femme-08","title":"dodge la femme","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68589819/la-femme-08.jpg","fileMasterId":68589819,"fileName":"la-femme-08.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-18T12:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lafemme-homepage","title":"dodge la femme","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62285903/lafemme-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62285903,"fileName":"lafemme-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":636378,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"dodge la femme","caption":"","fileMasterId":62285891,"fileName":"la-femme-1956.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62285891/la-femme-1956.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"Few people appreciate or even remember the La Femme, the auto industry’s first attempt to market directly to women.

Eventually my racing aspirations gave way to a long held interest in filmmaking and I got my B.A. from the University of Michigan's burgeoning film program.  U of M taught me to write and introduced me to my excellent husband.  We spent five adventurous years in Los Angeles in the entertainment and publishing industries before returning to Ann Arbor where our lovely daughter came into the world.  Personally, I expend a good deal of energy on K-12 public education advocacy.  Professionally, I've been a freelance writer for the last ten years specializing in health issues and automotive content from a lifestyle perspective.  There's a lot more to auto life than zero to sixty.","fileMasterId":63361764,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63361764/63361764.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-24T11:56:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"store-homepage","title":"auto parts store","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62505236/store-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62505236,"fileName":"store-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-24T11:56:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"store-homepage","title":"auto parts store","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62505236/store-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62505236,"fileName":"store-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-24T11:56:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"store-header","title":"auto parts store","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62505290/store-header.jpg","fileMasterId":62505290,"fileName":"store-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-24T11:56:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"store-homepage","title":"auto parts store","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62505236/store-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62505236,"fileName":"store-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":636922,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The idea of entering an automotive parts superstore is so daunting for some of us that even if we need something as simple as windshield washer fluid, we will pay a premium to have the dealer to do it rather than buy it ourselves.

Still, many drivers will appreciate all the available technology in the form of a media touchscreen and a navigation system, as well as driver assist options. Select Econ mode, which comes standard on the Accord, to save fuel.  Opt for the new Honda Lane Watch to monitor those cars that sneak up alongside you, or avoid punting the rear end of the car in front of you, with the forward collision warning system. To add to its practical appeal, the Accord is a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-26T13:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rav4-mac-homepage2","title":"toyota rav4 to mackinac","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67367950/rav4-mac-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":67367950,"fileName":"rav4-mac-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-26T13:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rav4-mac-homepage2","title":"toyota rav4 to mackinac","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67367950/rav4-mac-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":67367950,"fileName":"rav4-mac-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-26T13:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rav4-mac-header","title":"toyota rav4 to mackinac","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67367932/rav4-mac-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67367932,"fileName":"rav4-mac-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-26T13:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rav4-mac-homepage2","title":"toyota rav4 to mackinac","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67367950/rav4-mac-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":67367950,"fileName":"rav4-mac-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":637301,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Like most people in Michigan, I was suffering from cabin fever when I climbed into a Toyota RAV4 at the start of a frigid February weekend.

It has an eight-inch touchscreen information display and, on the one we drove, navigation (we had the optional navigation system/uplevel surround sound package, priced at $905). Cadillac uses terms such as \"intuitive\" and \"smartphone- and tablet-influenced controls\" to describe the system, but really, it's complex.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Designer Walkaround","id":1034952,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-03T07:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mustang-homepage","title":"2015 ford mustang gt coupe","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63421502/mustang-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63421502,"fileName":"mustang-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-03T07:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mustang-homepage","title":"2015 ford mustang gt coupe","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63421502/mustang-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63421502,"fileName":"mustang-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-03T07:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mustang-header2","title":"2015 ford mustang gt coupe","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67535716/mustang-header2.jpg","fileMasterId":67535716,"fileName":"mustang-header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-03T07:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mustang-homepage","title":"2015 ford mustang gt coupe","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63421502/mustang-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63421502,"fileName":"mustang-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":637527,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"I met Ford's newest vice-president of design, Moray Callum, in the late 1980s when he worked as a design consultant to Ghia, a design studio in Turin, Italy, owned by Ford.

In that case, you may want to know that I also edit the magazine’s Ignition section, read lots of Kurt Vonnegut, and would eat sushi at every meal if it were socially acceptable. Reality tells me you just want to know how I landed this amazing job. Fine. Based on my experience, here’s some advice.<br><br>\n\n1)\tMajor in journalism. Most of us here aren’t racecar drivers -- we’re writers and reporters. It probably helps if you’ve attended journalism school, as I did at the University of Maryland, or worked for some periodical. That said, deputy editor Joe DeMatio now claims he was more intrigued by my second degree in Jewish studies, even though he’s never once asked me to write about the exploits of Simon bar Kochba. <br>\n2)\tKnow how to operate a manual transmission. Seems obvious, but I actually did not upon being hired. I taught myself during my first month on the job by visiting six Ann Arbor dealerships to test drive stick-shift economy cars. My sincere apologies to whoever ended up buying that Ford Focus. <br>\n3)\tLearn everything you can about cars. I grew up pouring over car magazines and memorizing zero-to-sixty times as if they were catechism. People have been asking me for car-buying advice since before I could drive. <br>\n4)\tRealize you actually know nothing about cars. A brief conversation with design editor Robert Cumberford, editor-in-chief Jean Jennings, or any other of the veterans here leaves you humbled and astounded by their wealth of automotive knowledge. It’s truly one of the best parts of working here.  <br>\n5)\tBe persistent. I wrote to <em>Automobile</em>’s editors. And called. And wrote them some more. <br>\n6)\tBe lucky. I really have no idea why then deputy editor Joe DeMatio answered my unsolicited voicemail. I hadn’t even pronounced his name correctly (it’s De-MAY-shee-oh, not De-MAH-tee-oh). But he did, and here I am, driving cars and writing about them for my devoted fans.","fileMasterId":74355261,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355261/74355261.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2109,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"david.zenlea@automobilemag.com"},{"id":2110,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/101139514776041164855"},{"id":2111,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/david.zenlea"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044,6202077,6202090]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-07T13:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"geneva-homepage","title":"best and worst from geneva","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69403677/geneva-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69403677,"fileName":"geneva-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-07T13:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"geneva-homepage","title":"best and worst from geneva","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69403677/geneva-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69403677,"fileName":"geneva-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-07T13:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"geneva-header","title":"best and worst from geneva","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69403674/geneva-header.jpg","fileMasterId":69403674,"fileName":"geneva-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-07T13:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"geneva-homepage","title":"best and worst from geneva","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69403677/geneva-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69403677,"fileName":"geneva-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":638048,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"best and worst from geneva","caption":"","fileMasterId":67703839,"fileName":"mazda-hazumi-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67703839/mazda-hazumi-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":853},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1280}},"order":0,"text":"<h3>Hit: Mazda 2</h3> \nThe Hazumi concept, which will be the Mazda 2 just as soon as it grows real door handles and mirrors, is yet another handsome execution of the Kodo design language.

U of M taught me to write and introduced me to my excellent husband.  We spent five adventurous years in Los Angeles in the entertainment and publishing industries before returning to Ann Arbor where our lovely daughter came into the world.  Personally, I expend a good deal of energy on K-12 public education advocacy.  Professionally, I've been a freelance writer for the last ten years specializing in health issues and automotive content from a lifestyle perspective.  There's a lot more to auto life than zero to sixty.","fileMasterId":63361764,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63361764/63361764.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-20T05:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"openbay-homepage","title":"OpenBay Service App","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64473311/openbay-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":64473311,"fileName":"openbay-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-20T05:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"openbay-homepage","title":"OpenBay Service App","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64473311/openbay-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":64473311,"fileName":"openbay-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-20T05:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"openbay-header","title":"OpenBay Service App","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64473305/openbay-header.jpg","fileMasterId":64473305,"fileName":"openbay-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-20T05:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"openbay-homepage","title":"OpenBay Service App","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64473311/openbay-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":64473311,"fileName":"openbay-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":640000,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Have you ever wished there was a way to compare, book, and pay for auto mechanic services online or from your phone?
