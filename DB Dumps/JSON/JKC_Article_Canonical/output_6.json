I named all of our family cars and cried when they reached the end of their useful life.

And here I am… grateful and enjoying every second.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-22T08:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup-nov22-homepage","title":"weekly windup 11 22","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57542810/windup-nov22-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":57542810,"fileName":"windup-nov22-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-22T08:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup-nov22-header","title":"weekly windup 11 22","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57542807/windup-nov22-header.jpg","fileMasterId":57542807,"fileName":"windup-nov22-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":573}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-22T08:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup-nov22-homepage","title":"weekly windup 11 22","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57542810/windup-nov22-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":57542810,"fileName":"windup-nov22-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":591853,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>1.</strong> Famous <a href=\"http://hiconsumption.com/2013/10/famous-movie-cars-by-nicolas-bannister/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">movie cars</a> reimagined.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Just a few random items, all related to cars in some way, that you will want to have a look at.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Road Trips","id":1034777,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-road-trips","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-03T15:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"vw-la-homepage","title":"three vws in la","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62579893/vw-la-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62579893,"fileName":"vw-la-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-03T15:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"vw-la-header","title":"three vws in la","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62579890/vw-la-header.jpg","fileMasterId":62579890,"fileName":"vw-la-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-04T07:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"vw-la-all-homepage2","title":"three vws in la","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64070946/vw-la-all-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":64070946,"fileName":"vw-la-all-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":592520,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Once you arrive at an auto show—especially one like the Los Angeles Auto Show, which has two large halls that take some time to cover in detail—it's hard to get outside.

Never mind that VW has in fact sold fifty XL1s in Germany for about $150,000 apiece. The harshness and noise would make this car totally unacceptable here. The whole purpose of the car was to be a hyper-fuel-efficient exercise, a “one-liter car” in that it could go 100 kilometers on one little liter of fuel. After several years of trying and several iterations, this current XL1 actually beat the goal, achieving 100 km on 0.9 liter of diesel fuel.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"VW engineers employed every aero, every fuel economy, and every weight-saving trick it had learned in the nine years it worked on the one-liter car.

The fact that this one starts just under $20,000 is a definite enticement to the first-time car buyer or, really, anybody who is in the market for an affordable vehicle. There are four levels to the 500L lineup: the entry-level Pop, which costs $19,995 with destination charge; the Easy, the car we tested, which starts at $20,995; the higher-end Lounge, and the off-road-styled Trekking (which only looks rugged).","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"left","altText":"2014 fiat 500l easy","caption":"","fileMasterId":59292167,"fileName":"fiat-500l-14.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59292167/fiat-500l-14.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":4,"text":"I happen to really like the way the 500L looks, and my eighteen-year-old son, Henry, a cranky iconoclast whose tastes run to ancient Volvos, agreed with me as he climbed into the passenger's seat.

It only missed the latest 2014 rating, issued this week, because Fiat doesn't offer front crash prevention technology (such as forward collision warning systems), a new IIHS requirement this year. The 500L is fitted with front and rear head curtain airbags and front seat-mounted torso airbags. There's also a separate driver's-side knee airbag in the lower instrument panel to help mitigate knee injuries in front crashes.

However, bravo to those same designers, because once inside, it feels downright spacious. What the 500L loses in style cred, it gains in affordability and usefulness.

With the prices starting to come down, and more public outlets becoming available so the idea of plugging in your car becomes more acceptable, I'm guessing more and more people will be ready to adopt this kind of vehicle.

But it's also not the boring sedan that you might have expected until you get inside. The Volt deserves a lot more respect than I was expecting to give it. It is fun to drive not just because it's, you know, fun to drive, but because you can enjoy geeking out over the gasoline-to-electric ratio and keeping track of your fuel efficiency. You can also enjoy how long you can go without pulling into a gas station. It's got all the safety and technology features you would want on a new sedan, plus it will save you a bunch of money on fuel. According to Chevrolet, the average user fills up the tank once a month and saves $900 a year on fuel costs. The average mpg number for the eighteen Volt owners who post their results on <a href=\"http://www.fueleconomy.gov/mpg/MPG.do?action=mpgData&vehicleID=32655&browser=true&details=on\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the EPA's Fueleconomy.gov:</a> 150.7 mpg.<br>\n<br>\nNow, if you're going to sit down with an amortization table and figure out whether the fuel savings will equal the extra cost over a \"regular\" car, you might not get the numbers to crunch, but there's something very satisfying about dipping a toe into the waters of alternative power on a day-to-day basis. And, with the new price reduction, if you get the maximum $7,500 tax credit, you're talking about a starting price around $28,000, just about where you'd be for a traditionally powered sedan.<br>\n<br>\nGive this car a try.

I like to interview them, learn about their lives, photograph them, and write their stories. The people at Jean Knows Cars noticed me through my project, Humans of Ann Arbor. In that project, I tool around the city of Ann Arbor, introducing myself to anyone who draws my eye. If they are open to it, I take a photo of them and hear a little bit about them. Then I post the photos and stories on Facebook. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/HumansofAnnArbor\" rel=\"”nofollow”\" target=\"”_blank”\">Humans  of Ann  Arbor</a>  has followers from all over the world who check in on a daily basis to see ordinary people and their extraordinary stories.\n\nI have been studying people since I was a little girl in Missouri. Where I grew up, studying people often led you to the cars they loved. My grandpa had a gas station in Claycomo, Missouri, which he opened in the 1950s, and he passed his love of cars and taking care of the people who drove them down to my dad. Dad was a mechanic and a service supervisor all his life. We had a steady barrage of cars coming into our lives…mostly Chevys. To impress my dad, I learned to identify every car I could, and I used to name the cars while we drove down the road. Car culture is big in Missouri. Would you believe that I had friends who were sisters named Nova and Chevelle? If\nyou didn’t grow up the way I did, you might not get the significance of that, but suffice it to say that my people love their cars.\n\nThe car I adored most was the Chevrolet Corvair my dad gave me when I was in high school. It spent more time in my dad's shop than it did on the road, but in those moments when it was drivable, I knew what it was to love a car. It was a thing of beauty: pale cream with a plaid madras interior. I loved the sound and feel of the engine…it was more like a soft purr than a roar. I can still remember how it smelled and what it was like to drive it with the windows rolled down on a warm day. I've had lots of cars since then, and I loved some of them, too. But the Corvair was my first car love and will always be my favorite.\n\nAfter high school, I drove my car to Springfield, Missouri, to study communications at Missouri State. Later, I drove a different car to Chicago to study photography at Columbia College. I worked in Chicago as a freelance photographer and studio manager for many years before moving to Ann Arbor, where I continue to do freelance photography. I am excited about combining my love of studying people with my interest in cars. I want to explore how cars serve us, how they are intertwined in our lives, and what makes us love them. I can't wait to let you know what I find out.","fileMasterId":66360111,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66360111/66360111.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Whole Famn Damily","id":1034774,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/kids-in-the-car/whole-famn-damily","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Kids in the Car","id":1034769,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-05T14:04:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"photo-homepage","title":"The Car Stays in the Picture","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66404883/photo-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66404883,"fileName":"photo-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-05T14:04:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"photo-header","title":"The Car Stays in the Picture","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66404880/photo-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66404880,"fileName":"photo-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-05T14:04:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"photo-homepage","title":"The Car Stays in the Picture","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66404883/photo-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66404883,"fileName":"photo-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":596177,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"The Car Stays in the Picture","caption":"","fileMasterId":66404868,"fileName":"photo-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66404868/photo-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"“When my parents were cool” is the caption under a photo a friend recently posted on social media.

His race report on the 12 Hours of Sebring was published when he was an eighteen-year-old Art Center student in 1954. Subsequently he has published thousands of articles on cars and airplanes, in American, Asian, English, European, and South American magazines. He contributed to several books, including the entire text of the well-reviewed <em>Auto Legends</em>, now available in five translated editions -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Polish in addition to the original English version. In 1985, <em>Automobile Magazine</em> founder David E. Davis, Jr., invited him to be one of two executive editors when <em>Automobile</em> was in the planning stages. Cumberford demurred, saying he knew nothing about magazine production and claims he still doesn’t, except that it’s important to meet deadlines. He contributed features from the beginning and began his popular “By Design” column in the sixth issue, September 1986.  \n<br><br>\nIn car design, Cumberford was even more a youthful prodigy. He sketched the body for the first car ever built to his designs when he was a fifteen-year-old Los Angeles high-school student. That car, the Parkinson Jaguar Special, is still active in historic racing sixty years after it was created. Hired directly by General Motors’ legendary Vice President of Design, Harley J. Earl, Cumberford became a professional car designer at nineteen. Leaving Detroit, he returned to California to attend UCLA to study philosophy. He rejoined the automotive world in the early 1960s and has continued to create new automotive shapes since then, always as an independent design consultant. He has lived and worked in six of the fifty United States and in France, Mexico, and Switzerland. The range of his design projects includes both racing and touring cars, trucks, aircraft, boats, hovercraft, and even ecological architecture. \n<br><br>\nHe is known worldwide for strong opinions but is well-respected in the design world because it is known that he is always completely honest in his views, with no agenda other than respect for good design and good designers. “There’s no ad hominem,” he says, “I judge the design, not the designers. There are designers I really like personally who’ve been credited with designs I heartily dislike -- for reasons I always state very clearly -- and designs I love done by people with whom I have absolutely no affinity. Except that we both like their work.”","fileMasterId":74354961,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74354961/74354961.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2022,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"rcumberford@gmail.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044,6202077]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-12T20:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"concept-homepage2","title":"how to look at a concept car","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66991284/concept-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":66991284,"fileName":"concept-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-12T20:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"concept-header2","title":"how to look at a concept car","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66991221/concept-header2.jpg","fileMasterId":66991221,"fileName":"concept-header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-12T20:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"concept-homepage2","title":"how to look at a concept car","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66991284/concept-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":66991284,"fileName":"concept-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":597202,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Auto shows are huge events in major cities all over the world.

Detroit’s North American International Auto Show is perhaps the most important of all such shows to industry leaders and the world press, attracting more than 5,000 international journalists despite the dubious attractions of a ruined and bankrupt city in the dead of winter.

At the absolute peak of American prosperity in the 1950s, such vehicles were known as “dream cars,” and they reflected an optimism and willingness to try anything so long as it could be seen as “progress.” General Motors became famous for its Motorama shows, staged in New York’s Waldorf-Astoria hotel ballroom. In low-rent-rate January, of course. Its multiple dreams, never fewer than one for each of the company’s five car divisions, were not really cars. For the most part, they didn’t even run, simply being Hollywood-style stage props, enormously heavy objects that had to be pushed or tugged into place.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"That still happens, of course, but most manufacturers now take pride in bringing vehicles to shows that do have real engines and can move—slowly and carefully, please—under their own power. Since cars, like birds and wild animals, can not really be fully assessed aesthetically until you see them in motion, wonderful films are made to be displayed on giant video screens behind the cars at shows. BMW went further at last fall’s Frankfurt Motor Show, with an indoor circuit encompassing hills and curves, allowing its new electric and hybrid cars to circulate all day long, taking chosen clients for exhilarating rides inside its pavilion.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<strong>Whenever you see someone’s new baby one of the first things you look for is visual signs of the parents.</strong> “Oh, he looks just like his father!” is a common cry, unless it’s “She’s the image of her mother.” This is a natural tendency that really applies to cars as well. Is there a perceptible family linkage? Can you see something of the object’s genetic heritage? You should, however subtle the traces, because one of the many functions of a one-of-a-kind show car is to lead to acceptance of change. Sometimes a company will have a clear plan to change a popular model, and to make that palatable for its clientele, a transitional “concept” model is actually made after the real car has been completely tooled and slated for introduction in a year or two.

Take Chrysler Corporation’s Viper, like the initial Corvette an almost Spartan two-seat sports model. Shown at the NAIAS in 1989, it was so popular that a decision to produce it was made after the show, and by 1992 it was available in the marketplace. That concept has now evolved through three generations (compared with the Corvette’s seven successive iterations).

That’s an idea Buick proposed on a dream car half a century ago, and it has taken a long, long time to become accessible.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Teenagers","id":1034773,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car/teenagers","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Kids in the Car","id":1034769,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-4-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 4","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65632180/insurance-4-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65632180,"fileName":"insurance-4-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-4-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 4","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65632180/insurance-4-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65632180,"fileName":"insurance-4-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-4-header","title":"insurance tip no 4","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65632177/insurance-4-header.jpg","fileMasterId":65632177,"fileName":"insurance-4-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-4-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 4","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65632180/insurance-4-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65632180,"fileName":"insurance-4-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":616268,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"There's an important talk you probably haven't yet had, but should, with your young teenager.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Insurance agent Nathan Lamb cautions that parents should start thinking about, and budgeting for, teenage drivers when they turn fourteen, not sixteen.

Although you will note the vehicle your teen will use as his or her primary vehicle, like you, he or she is covered as an occasional driver on other cars as well.  Downside: Your premium will go up for a few years, now that you’ve added a young and inexperienced driver.  The number, of course, depends on the coverage you chose, but in my case, for example, were I to add my sixteen-year-old to my policy with the Fiat 500 as my only car, the total cost of my insurance would increase 65 percent.

The teen will be placed with a higher-risk insurer, which means much higher premiums.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<strong>3. Get your teen his or her own car?</strong> Nathan's advice: keep the old family car for the teen and give yourself the new one.  It costs far less to insure a teen for a clunker than a shiny new Mustang.  I’ll add that, two years ago, when I started talking to my Honda salesman about replacing my 2002 Odyssey, he advised me not to sell it or trade it in but to save it for my daughter, who was at that point fourteen. His argument: “You don’t want to be insuring a teenager on a new vehicle!”  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"Nathan echoed my salesman’s advice.  Again, in my case, were we to keep the ’02 Odyssey in addition to the Fiat and list Sarah’s primary vehicle as the Odyssey, my insurance will go up 57 percent, less than if I insured her on the Fiat alone.  Why?  I would keep the multi-car discount, and the resale value of an ‘02 Odyssey is far less than that of a '13 Fiat. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<strong>4. Establish responsibility.</strong> Since you are establishing parameters for your driving teen (who is responsible for paying for gas or routine maintenance), set your teen straight on accidents as well.  Discuss how expensive they are, who pays for them, and how auto insurance works.  If you are getting your teen his or her own car, you might consider limited collision. If your teen is in a wreck because of poor choices, the onus on fixing or replacing the car falls on him or her.  Depending on the make and model year, you could be talking a couple of hundred dollars for a ding up to many thousands of dollars for major work.  How you work this with your teen falls to parenting style. I asked Nathan what he was doing with his own upcoming teenage driver.  He smiled and said, “She’ll be driving my old 2007 Camry.  And if she wrecks it, she’ll be walking until she can afford to buy her own car. It’s a one-shot deal in our house.”  That’s my kind of parenting as well, but every parent has to find his or her comfort zone.  Determine that zone before an incident so your teen understands his or her responsibility. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<strong>5.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Designer Walkaround","id":1034952,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-18T07:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lexus-rc-f-homepage","title":"2015 lexus rc f","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68575260/lexus-rc-f-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68575260,"fileName":"lexus-rc-f-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-18T07:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lexus-rc-f-header","title":"2015 lexus rc f","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62275820/lexus-rc-f-header.jpg","fileMasterId":62275820,"fileName":"lexus-rc-f-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-18T07:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lexus-rc-f-homepage","title":"2015 lexus rc f","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68575260/lexus-rc-f-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68575260,"fileName":"lexus-rc-f-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":636339,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The head of Lexus design, Yasuo Kajino, is a beautifully articulate man on the subject of design.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-21T07:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-homepage","title":"weekly windup 2 21","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62401610/ww-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62401610,"fileName":"ww-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-21T07:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-homepage","title":"weekly windup 2 21","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62401610/ww-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62401610,"fileName":"ww-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-21T07:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-header","title":"weekly windup 2 21","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62401607/ww-header.jpg","fileMasterId":62401607,"fileName":"ww-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-21T07:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-homepage","title":"weekly windup 2 21","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62401610/ww-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62401610,"fileName":"ww-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":636617,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"weekly windup 2 21","caption":"","fileMasterId":62401604,"fileName":"jumping.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62401604/jumping.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>1. </strong>How good are you at driving in reverse?

Pop the back hatch to access the generous storage compartment for luggage or sports equipment. Each seat feels like its own little cockpit and the two rear ones fold down when necessary to extend cargo space.  Slide into the leather-covered cabin and enjoy meticulous Italian detail at every turn. If you plan on taking grandma for a ride she’ll need to use the front seat since, unlike the four-door Aston Martin Rapide, the FF has only two doors making easy rear access a challenge for some. However, when you step on the gas and feel the revs climb up to 8200 rpm there will be no doubt why you spent around $300,000 to own this versatile supercar.  The back-heavy look of the FF can seem like a departure from the classic Ferrari exterior silhouette and will not appeal to everyone.  However, enough prancing horse signatures remain to satisfy the buyer seeking a rarified vehicle that can get the groceries or tear up the track depending on their mood.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>Competitors:</h3>\r\nAston Martin Rapide<br>\r\nPorsche Panamera Turbo S<br>\r\nMaserati Quattroporte","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>Cool Tech:</h3>\r\nStop&Start technology helps reduce CO2 emissions.<br>\r\nFerrari’s 4RM four-wheel drive system efficiently targets torque to each wheel as needed.<br>\r\n<h3>\r\nLooks:</h3>\r\nFrau aniline leather interiors are not only beautiful but also impossibly soft.<br>\r\nCenter column travels from front to rear, compartmentalizing each of the four seats.\r\n<br>","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":41822,"make":"Ferrari","model":"FF","year":2014},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"641bb9a2-17a1-3cc9-9585-5bd8468fcc24","type":"mediaTag","name":"Indulgence","path":"/Main/Indulgence"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:15:52.233-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546552234 }} },{ "_id":486255,"title":"2014 Honda Crosstour","subTitle":"Coming into its own.","slug":"2014-honda-crosstour","promoTitle":"2014 Honda Crosstour","promoTeaserSmall":"Coming into its own.","promoTeaser":"Coming into its own.","keywords":["2014 Honda Crosstour"],"metaTitle":"2014 Honda Crosstour  - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["2014 Honda Crosstour","Honda"],"metaDescription":"2014 Honda Crosstour: Coming into its own.

The 2014 model carries the crossover torch with a more SUV-like body highlighted by larger foglamps, new wheels, wider rearview mirrors, and chrome accents that give it a more aggressive presence overall.  It’s lower to the ground like a car but has a high seating position for visibility, a feature especially important in a vehicle with a swooping rear end that cuts down on some of the greenhouse real estate in back.  To feel even more secure when backing out of the driveway, all Crosstours now come with a standard rearview camera.  Pick from two engine choices, a five-speed four-cylinder automatic or a paddle-shift-equipped six-speed V-6, and there are also front-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive models to consider. Crossovers seek to tick a lot of users' boxes, and this one delivers great handling as well as an enviable 25.7 cubic feet of cargo space, and that’s before folding the 60/40 split rear seats down nearly flat. The interior is comfortable with good headroom, the stack and dash are neatly arranged ,but like its Accord sibling there is a certain panache lacking. Tech and driver assist options aplenty make up for the pedestrian interior, and count on Honda safety features to come standard. The Crosstour is more fuel efficient than earlier iterations, with Honda reporting that the two-wheel-drive I-4 achieves 22 mpg for city driving and delivers up to 31 mpg on the highway. Now that it has finally squeaked into the over-30 mpg-club, followers of the brand will be more attracted than ever to this most distinctive Honda.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>Competitors:</h3>\r\nSubaru Outback<br>\r\nToyota Venza<br>\r\nVolvo XC70<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>Cool Tech:</h3>\nThe EX-L V-6 model is also available with real time four-wheel drive.<br>\nActive head restraints adjust forward to protect the neck in a rear-end collision.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>Looks:</h3>\nBeefier exterior gives a nod to the sport utility category but retains carlike accessibility.<br>\nUpholstery choices are predictable in a grayish ivory or black leather and black or ivory fabric.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>New for 2014</h3>\r\nRefresh came last year so changes are minimal.

Updated last year, the stylish coupe only seats two people, and maybe only two small people at that, with a slim 49.1 cubic feet of passenger space. Cargo space is spartan as well, but Honda seeks to make the most of it with storage bins in a rear console that can also fold down for longer items. The hatchback’s low back end gives it that speedster look but unfortunately also limits rear visibility.  Still, the tight squeeze fits with the character of the car. Buyers can choose between increased fuel economy with the continuously variable automatic transmission (36 mpg city/39 highway) and the driving enjoyment of a nicely weighted manual transmission that achieves a respectable 31 mpg for city driving and 38 on the highway.  Great fuel efficiency plus a low price point, starting around $20,000, will attract the young and eco minded as well as those looking for a fun second car.  Honda’s Bluetooth HandsFreeLink and a rearview camera come standard on all models, while the EX with navigation comes with an SMS text message function that lets you hear your messages or have them displayed when parked.  Three driving modes, Sport, Normal, and Econ, help you customize your drive.  If you are looking for a hybrid with a manual transmission, look no further than the CR-Z.  It’s the only one on the market.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>Competitors:</h3>\r\nHyundai Veloster<br>\r\nVolkswagen Beetle<br>\r\nScion tC<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>Cool Tech:</h3>\r\nPlus Sport button on the steering wheel gives engine a five-second power boost.<br>\r\nText message capability on EX with Navi model.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>Looks:</h3>\r\nRacing-car-inspired aluminum pedals. <br>\r\n16-inch alloy wheels and rear diffuser rev up the exterior.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":40710,"make":"Honda","model":"CR-Z","year":2014},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:15:52.994-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546552995 }} },{ "_id":487800,"title":"Bob's Big Day at Westminster","subTitle":"Every dog has his day!

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Winter tires have a unique tread that notches or bites into the snow and ice for better traction, but on clear roads, grip can suffer.

With the Technology package (a $3,000 option), you get “smart” cruise control, blind spot detection, and lane departure warning. The blind spot detection lights up a red symbol on the side mirrors when another vehicle is near yours—which can quickly become a can’t-live-without feature once you are used to it. The lane departure warning feature is enabled with a switch to the left of the steering wheel. Choose it, and it will make an annoying “beepbeepbeep” when you even think about getting up on the center line or close to the edge of the road. The biggest magic, though, is found in the “smart” cruise control. I set it to 71—the cops in Indiana are ruthless—and enjoyed the way it showed an image of my car on the dash in front of me, then added an image of the car in front of me whenever there was one anywhere in range. Then, as soon as I got any closer than the computer’s idea of safe following distance, the car overrode the cruise control and slowed me down—all the way to 60 mph, at which time I overrode it myself by accelerating and passing the sedate Subaru that was, in my mind, plenty far ahead of me the whole time. For those of you who like to speed up on slower cars and pass them—just about everybody—you might call this frustrating. But put these three safety features together, and you are not going to be in any danger of rear-ending anybody, straying out of your lane, or missing a car, bicyclist, or motorcyclist in your blind spot. Even the heated steering wheel shepherds you along, since it's only heated in the center where your hands are supposed to be, not at the top or bottom.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"Do you see why I’d love to see my eighty-five-year-old father signing a deal to buy one of these?

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-28T12:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-homepage","title":"weekly windup 3 28","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70839888/ww-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70839888,"fileName":"ww-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-28T12:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-homepage","title":"weekly windup 3 28","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70839888/ww-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70839888,"fileName":"ww-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-28T12:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-header","title":"weekly windup 3 28","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70839885/ww-header.jpg","fileMasterId":70839885,"fileName":"ww-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":316},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":499}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-28T12:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-homepage","title":"weekly windup 3 28","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70839888/ww-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70839888,"fileName":"ww-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":641156,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>1. </strong>Dog lovers will not turn their nose up to <a href=\"http://laughingsquid.com/nice-nosing-you-a-photo-series-of-doggie-snouts-up-close/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> one.

That's thanks to the 60/40 split folding Magic Seat. Each side folds flat with an effortless flick of a switch, and there really is amazing space behind the front seats when they're folded: 52.7 cubic feet, compared with 38.3 cubic feet in the competing Nissan Versa Note. I opened the hatch and climbed in with the seats folded flat: Yes, I could lie down in the back without going diagonal. Keeping in mind that I'm 5'3\", that's still impressive for a car this small.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-16T07:09:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"sonata-homepage","title":"2015 hyundai sonata","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/72616551/sonata-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":72616551,"fileName":"sonata-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-16T07:09:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"sonata-homepage","title":"2015 hyundai sonata","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/72616551/sonata-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":72616551,"fileName":"sonata-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-16T07:09:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"sonata-header","title":"2015 hyundai sonata","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/72616698/sonata-header.jpg","fileMasterId":72616698,"fileName":"sonata-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-16T07:09:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"sonata-homepage","title":"2015 hyundai sonata","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/72616551/sonata-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":72616551,"fileName":"sonata-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":665540,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Auto-show reveals are always exciting, and the one last night for the 2015 Hyundai Sonata was no exception, as our video (below) shows.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Aftermarket","id":1034783,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/aftermarket-car-parts","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-22T12:42:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driveguard-homepage","title":"bridgestone run flat tires","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69802672/driveguard-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69802672,"fileName":"driveguard-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":669},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1371}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-22T12:42:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driveguard-homepage","title":"bridgestone run flat tires","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69802672/driveguard-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69802672,"fileName":"driveguard-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":669},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1371}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-22T12:42:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driveguard-header","title":"bridgestone run flat tires","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69802663/driveguard-header.jpg","fileMasterId":69802663,"fileName":"driveguard-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-22T12:42:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driveguard-homepage","title":"bridgestone run flat tires","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69802672/driveguard-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69802672,"fileName":"driveguard-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":669},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1371}}},"pages":[{"id":666479,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"bridgestone run flat tires","caption":"","fileMasterId":69802675,"fileName":"driveguard-tread.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69802675/driveguard-tread.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":845},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1330}},"order":0,"text":"Do you know what to do if one of your tires blows out while you are driving?

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

As a young adult I kicked around motor-racing, training to drive while I worked at a Brands Hatch satellite in Miami.  I've been race staff at the Detroit Grand Prix, worked TV coverage of Formula 1, Indy and NASCAR and done the occasional ride and drive program.  Eventually my racing aspirations gave way to a long held interest in filmmaking and I got my B.A. from the University of Michigan's burgeoning film program.  U of M taught me to write and introduced me to my excellent husband.  We spent five adventurous years in Los Angeles in the entertainment and publishing industries before returning to Ann Arbor where our lovely daughter came into the world.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-17T06:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"may17-homepage","title":"windup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74006967/may17-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":74006967,"fileName":"may17-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-17T06:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"may17-homepage","title":"windup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74006967/may17-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":74006967,"fileName":"may17-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-17T06:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"may17-header","title":"windup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74006964/may17-header.jpg","fileMasterId":74006964,"fileName":"may17-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-17T06:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"may17-homepage","title":"windup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74006967/may17-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":74006967,"fileName":"may17-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":672652,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Just one week until a long weekend.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-24T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"may-24-homepage","title":"the weekly windup 5 24","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67597130/may-24-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67597130,"fileName":"may-24-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-24T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"may-24-homepage","title":"the weekly windup 5 24","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67597130/may-24-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67597130,"fileName":"may-24-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-24T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"may-24-header","title":"the weekly windup 5 24","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67597127/may-24-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67597127,"fileName":"may-24-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-24T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"may-24-homepage","title":"the weekly windup 5 24","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67597130/may-24-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67597130,"fileName":"may-24-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":691380,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>1.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]},{"id":10367,"roles":["Photographer"],"displayName":"Gabrielle George","firstName":"Gabrielle","lastName":"George","jobTitle":"Photo Intern","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"I am Gabrielle Taylor George, and I graduated in 2011 from Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the city I was born and raised in.

One cold day, one of the Klett boys—cute high schoolers who lived down the road—stopped his white Ford Bronco and asked if I wanted a ride home. My heart a bit aflutter, I tried to get in, but the Bronco lacked a running board for the vertically challenged. Between my short legs, girth, and complete lack of flexibility, I couldn’t step up into the car. I had to be hauled into the Bronco like a beached whale…and I wanted to die, right then and there.

A little over a year ago, Smart launched its Uncar ad campaign, and the brand is working that edginess in quest of a growing customer base.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"The microcar has an impressive commitment to personalization, offering dozens of colorful wrap kits to make your car stand out from the crowd.

Once the bestselling SUV from Europe, the XC90 has fallen way behind the curve, and the piddling updates for 2013 will hardly mitigate this laxity. If an important Volvo nameplate has suffered as the result of changes in Volvo’s corporate status, it’s the XC90. It’s the story of how a good-looking face can become merely familiar. The XC90 originated the trim, urbane look in the full-size crossover segment, but nothing has been done with that in years. And problems accelerated, so to speak, when the excellent V-8 departed the engine bay. Now left with the 236 horsepower 3.2-liter six-cylinder and six-speed automatic transmission as the only powertrain, the XC90 is dated and finds itself at a significant disadvantage to competitors; meager power output combines with mediocre fuel economy. For 2013, there are a few new items: for example, a leather strap on the tailgate, red wood trim in the interior, and white lighting for the instrumentation. The list of safety features looked good a few years ago, but today the XC90 even lags behind other Volvos in this aspect. The most important new feature it can receive is a refresh button.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Toyota certainly struck gold with its 50-mpg Prius hybrid, so last year, it took the Prius’s winning formula, added a model with a little more cargo space (and, according to some, better-looking styling), and called it the Prius v. Shortly thereafter, Toyota created the Prius Plug-in, which uses the same wedgy body of the workaday Prius but gets super-potent batteries that can be recharged in three hours from a standard power outlet, thus helping it travel up to fifteen miles at speeds up to 62 miles per hour on electricity alone.  Note, to stay in electric power, you have to go seriously easy on the go pedal, as the gas engine will fire up at the slightest provocation or incline. This makes driving an un-fun vehicle even less fun, but the payoff comes in stratospheric EPA-rated fuel economy of 87 MPGe. The catch? At nearly $33,000 before options, the plug-in model costs considerably more than the standard Prius. But for now, the Prius Plug-in remains the closest thing Toyota has to an extended-range electric vehicle like the Chevrolet Volt. Given the busy year it had in 2012, the Prius doesn’t change much for 2013, with the only noteworthy news being addition of the new Prius Persona Series, available in black, white, or new Black Cherry Pearl with seventeen-inch wheels, charcoal SofTex interior, and some dark chrome interior trim.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 3","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

We expect, however, that Toyota dealers may have a few 2012 RAV4s sitting around well into 2013, so what about that model? Well, the gen-three RAV4 has never been a shabby ride, having grown about as large as a compact crossover can get and still be considered “compact.” It even offers a vestigial third-row seat, although that’s a place we only recommend for compact people. The front two rows offer good views and space for four adults, and spendy types can select from a laundry list of options, including leather seats, navigation, and an audio system with EnTune data services and iTunes song tagging. Both of the RAV4’s available engines, a somewhat overburdened 179-horsepower four-cylinder and a 269-horsepower V-6, are available with front- or all-wheel drive. We prefer the V-6 not just for its passing power, but because its highway fuel economy remains close to that of the four-cylinder. California residents may also consider the new, all-electric RAV4, which was introduced in late 2012 for about $50,000, minus a $7,500 federal tax credit and a $2,500 state tax credit. Based on the 2012 model with some cosmetic refinements that make it both more distinct and more aerodynamic, the RAV4 EV is expected to continue unchanged well beyond the introduction of the all-new 2013 RAV4, which is set to make its debut by the end of 2012.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The T6 AWD has a 300-horsepower 3.0-liter turbocharged six (325 horsepower in the R-Design model), and all-wheel drive is standard. A six-speed automatic transmission is included with all models. Trim levels are Premier, Premier Plus, and Platinum. The latter adds navigation, a premium sound system, a backup camera, an integrated garage door opener, and active Xenon headlamps. Front and rear parking assistance is available on the R-Design. The S60 keeps up in the technology race, too, adding the standard Personal Car Communicator, first introduced in the S80, which knows from a distance if the car is locked and, thanks to a heartbeat sensor, if an intruder is inside.

But poor Dodge wouldn’t know about that; it hasn’t been a player in that segment for decades. When its current offering, the Avenger, came along in 2008, adopting the window treatment and muscular rear fenders of the big Charger sedan, customers ran in horror once they drove it—that is, if they could get past the wretched interior. Dodge gave the Avenger a thorough make-over for 2011, although no one seemed to notice, since the bulk of the work was done in places no one could see. The car’s sloppy handling was cleaned up, and a fabulous new 283-horsepower V-6 engine was offered. With its standard six-speed automatic transmission, V-6-powered Avengers achieve decent fuel economy (29 mpg highway). A four-cylinder model is offered, too, although with its antiquated four-speed automatic, highway mileage is not a lot better (31 mpg). The interior was simply revolutionized, with soft-touch material everywhere, edgy new color schemes, and handy connectivity features. In the end, the Avenger became a decent car overall. However, that was 2011, and nothing about the Avenger has changed much since then…except, that is, its competitive set, which now includes fresher (and better) mid-sizers from pretty much every carmaker that offers one. The Avenger’s sole claim to fame for 2013 is its status as the cheapest entry in the segment, as it should be. Its replacement is expected by 2014, which can’t come soon enough for Dodge.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Seriously, Dodge’s charismatic muscle car could be the best wing man (or wing woman) ever in terms of helping shy folks make friends. Despite receiving few updates over the years, the Challenger’s square-jawed styling is as fetching now as ever, with the new Rallye Redline package making even the base model look like a badass. The base Challenger is sort of badass, actually, with 305 horsepower available from its 3.5-liter V-6. Upgrade to the 375-horsepower R/T model to get more power and a pistol-grip manual shifter, or if you simply want to say yes when someone asks you, \"That thing got a Hemi?\" True horsepower addicts will love the 470-horsepower SRT8, which also happens to come with clever Track Apps that record acceleration, cornering, and braking performance to confirm that, yes, indeed, it really is fast. \n\nRegardless of what’s under the hood, the Challenger is built using the same big bones as the full-size Charger sedan, making it the only muscle car with five seatbelts. Also, despite its reverently retrospective styling and its intense interior ambiance, the Challenger offers countless luxury and convenience features, including an integrated Garmin-based navigation system, heated leather seats, and, on SRT8 models, an eighteen-speaker sound system with 900 watts that shouldn't have any problem drowning out the intoxicating exhaust note.

No bad thing, though, as both vehicles are quite nice overall. The Terrain’s rectilinear styling inside and out attempt to cast a more technical, masculine impression, though it can be seen by some as a bit over the top (particularly that obnoxious grille). The level of feature content is high, however, and fit and finish—a strong suit of GM’s of late—are excellent. Close your eyes (as a passenger, of course) and the smooth ride and quiet cabin may fool you into thinking you’re in a Lexus RX350, particularly in the case of the new-for-2013 Denali model, with its upgraded front shocks. The Denali also features an even glitzier grille, unique wheels, smoked mahogany trim, French seams, and a soft-touch dashboard. But you don’t have to spend Denali money to enjoy the Terrain’s huge, sliding back seat, excellent ergonomics, and complimentary six months of OnStar services. Power brokers may prefer the newly available 301-horsepower V-6, while efficiency-minded customers may gravitate to the 182-horsepower four-cylinder engine that features a transmission with “eco” mode. Even with optional all-wheel drive, the Terrain breaks little ground (pardon the pun) in the market, but it straddles the line between the mainstream and luxury ends of the mid-size SUV crossover class, and as such, is reasonably priced.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

It comes with either two or four doors and is the only two-door in the lineup – and the smallest model the automaker has ever built. The Evoque won major accolades, including being named the 2012 North American Truck of the Year by a prestigious panel of auto journalists. The Evoque marked a major shift for the British brand, which had been known for its boxy SUVs designed to tackle the harshest environment. The Evoque is showing the brand’s softer side. Victoria Beckham, the fashion designer and former Spice Girl, even created an Evoque Special Edition last spring, complete with a matching set of luggage, but the special model has yet to debut on the U.S. market. In the meantime, buyers will be attracted to the original’s appealing design, premium interior, and surprisingly roomy cabin. There is a downside to the sleek styling, however. The narrow windows may limit visibility and the cargo area is not as roomy as you’d expect from a Land Rover. The Evoque is powered by a respectable 240-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged inline four-cylinder engine – the vehicle’s sole powerplant. The engine is linked to a six-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy is so-so at 20 mpg in city driving and 28 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. And just like a designer outfit, the Evoque comes with a high starting price.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Virage is clearly related to its older Aston Martin siblings, but it has its own refined exterior styling.  The Virage is the whole package; it will take you to sports car heaven. In the Virage, you’ll find plenty of thoughtful touches including Aston Martin’s staple hand-stitched leather. The engine, a 5.9-liter V-12, has power that’s wedged evenly between the DBS and the DB9. Substantial twenty-inch wheels give the Virage more of a weighty and grounded appearance. Aluminum, carbon fiber, walnut, and Bridge of Weir leather are melded to created a modernist interior. Glass switches and leather-wrapped steering wheel are what makes Aston Martin interiors beautiful. Add to that carbon-disc brakes and a ten-setting adaptive Bilstein suspension. What this translates to is a hot sports car that handles with confidence, class, and style.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Car Guide","caption":"","fileMasterId":41467115,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41467115/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The available supercharged V-6 engine is capable of going from 0 to 60 mph in a speedy 5.3 seconds. The A6 has a luscious interior, with sleek lines and nice materials. An available navigation system has a Google Earth interface and can be set up as a mobile hotspot for up to eight devices. There is even a touchpad that can read your handwriting, though writing on the nav system with one eye on the road is probably at least as dangerous as texting while driving. Luckily, the A6 also includes lane departure warning, blind spot warning, and Audi Pre-Sense Plus, which will take various safety measures including autonomous braking and seatbelt tightening in the half-second before a collision. The A6 seems to have few downsides, though the loss of the wagon model from previous years still stings.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

The base 2013 Nissan GT-R Premium model starts at $97,820, reflecting a $6,870 increase over the outgoing model. The 2013 Nissan GT-R Black Edition starts at $107,320, reflecting an $11,200 price hike. Still, the GT-R is significantly cheaper than some of its chief competition, most notably the Porsche 911 Turbo. The 2013 GT-R gets performance enhancements, including a boost in horsepower from 530 to 545. It is equipped with a 3.8-liter twin-turbo V-6 engine linked to a six-speed automated manual transmission, but it lacks a conventional stick shift. The GT-R stands out with its distinctive good looks, standard adaptive suspension and four-season potential thanks to all-wheel drive. The suspension on the 2013 model has been retuned and the Black Edition gets a new dry carbon fiber spoiler. The new spoiler is handmade in a limited production run. Six exterior colors are available for 2013, including a four-stage metallic Super Silver. The GT-R scores points for its incredible performance, near-telepathic handling, and nice cabin. But it could be more involving and has a harsh, fidgety ride. Putting the GT-R through its paces on public roads may attract the attention of the local constabulary. To experience its true potential, it must be unleashed on a track.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 10","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Sometimes overlooked as just a cute car, the TT is actually fast and well built, and it certainly won’t bore you. The 2012 model year saw the introduction of the very fast RS model (0 to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds), which put an end to complaints that the TT is too precious to perform. Available with either a 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine and manual transmission (the TTRS) or a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, the TT has something for everyone. The TT’s interior is an interesting meld of racing-car-reminiscent shapes and materials with plush elements like sport seats and an optional navigation system. The exterior styling is just about perfect, exactly what you would expect from an Audi sports car. The TT gets more than 30 miles to the gallon on the highway, which might soften some of the sting of spending $50,000 to $60,000 on something so small. The 2013 model won’t see any massive changes, but new colors will join the TT’s palette, and all-leather, two-tone interiors will be available in the S and RS models.

The biggest knock against the outgoing model is that it was an old-fashioned SUV that was less refined than its rivals. The Pathfinder has shed its old V-8 engine, along with 500 pounds, and now returns 26 mpg on the highway. The 2013 Nissan Pathfinder FWD tips the scales at 4,149 pounds; in comparison, the lightest 2013 Ford Explorer weighs 4,448 pounds. The changes should translate to a more carlike ride. Although official pricing hasn’t been announced, Nissan says the Pathfinder is in line for a price cut and would start at less than $30,000. All 2013 Pathfinders now come equipped with a 260-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 engine mated with a next-generation Xtronic continuously variable transmission. The 2013 Pathfinder will be offered in 4x4 and 4x2 configurations and in four models – S, SV, SL and Platinum. It has a standard towing capacity of 5,000 pounds, significantly less than the outgoing model. The seven-passenger Pathfinder has more cabin space than the previous model. Options include a heated steering wheel, thirteen-speaker Bose Premium Audio system, dual-zone climate control, and remote engine start. Parents will love the new Latch and Glide system in the Pathfinder. Families no longer have to remove the child seat every time someone needs access to the third row.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5.5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

That means it’s even more fun to drive, sleeker and more pleasing to look at, more luxurious, and better-equipped. As usual, what’s under the hood is excellent: the 300-horsepower 3.0-liter six-cylinder is included with the 335i. But the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder in the 328i won’t disappoint anyone with 240 horsepower and greater frugality. There’s also the option of the six-speed manual transmission or a new eight-speed automatic. Equipped with the automatic transmission, the 328i gets 36 mpg highway and the 335i gets 33 mpg highway. Not bad! The forthcoming ActiveHybrid 3, which adds a turbocharger to the six-cylinder and combines its output with assist from an electric motor, promises an improvement in fuel efficiency without sacrificing sportiness. The 335is coupe and convertible make 320 horsepower with the six-cylinder, adding a performance edge.

But with the new model year, the Japanese truck falls farther behind its American competition, especially in terms of engine offerings and fuel economy. The Titan gets just one engine, a standard 317-horsepower 5.6-liter V-8 linked to a standard five-speed automatic transmission, and no V-6 engine. This in an era when the 2013 Ford F-150 rolls out a restyled model with a range of engine choices, including a 302-horsepower 3.7-liter V-6 and a 365-horsepower 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6. All F-150s get the more modern six-speed automatic transmission as well. The Titan lags well behind the competition in terms of fuel economy, with the two-wheel-drive version returning just 13 mpg in city driving and 18 mpg on the highway according to the EPA. There is no regular cab version of the Titan either. On the plus side, the PRO-4X Titan gets a mini-makeover for the new model year, with revised graphics, satin chrome grille, dark wheel finish, and a revised interior look. The Titan gets kudos for its macho styling, strong V-8, and good brakes, but it still is a dark horse when compared to its rivals from Detroit that seem better able to keep pace with the constant changes in the truck market.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7.5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The brand-new Encore is a Continental take on the crossover utility vehicle. It is built on the same platform as GM’s Europe-market Opel Corsa, meaning it is small. Really small: 168.5 inches long, shorter than a Honda Civic and very close to the same size as the compact Audi A3 hatchback. In fact, Buick is going after the same kinds of buyers who look at Audi’s A3. The Encore is a front-wheel-drive vehicle with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, and an all-wheel-drive model is available. The interior is similar to those in other current Buicks such as the Verano sedan, with a center instrument panel featuring Buick’s voice-activated IntelliLink system and its seven-inch color display screen, as well as blue ambient lighting. The Encore is loaded with safety equipment and electronics, including ten airbags, traction control, remote start, Bose premium audio, and a heated, leather-covered steering wheel. Options include a backup camera and front and rear parking sensors. Active noise cancellation and heavy use of sound-dampening technology such as an acoustically treated headliner should get this small vehicle closer to the serene feeling one expects from a Buick. Time will tell if American buyers will flock to this five-passenger crossover; it goes on sale in the U.S. in early 2013.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Interestingly, though, the Buick LaCrosse is aimed just as much at buyers in China as those in the United States. Logical, since Buicks are actually bigger sellers there. A benefit of that market strategy is that rear-seat room is generous in the LaCrosse, because chauffeurs often drive this type of car in China. If you plan to do your own driving, you have two choices of engine. There’s a mild hybrid four-cylinder—meaning the engine is supplemented by an electric motor and a lithium-ion battery that improve fuel economy but don’t power the car by themselves. With that engine choice, fuel economy is an impressive 36 mpg on the highway. Who would expect that number from a sedan this size? The other engine is a V-6, required if you want the full-time all-wheel-drive version of the LaCrosse. Rear park assist, blind spot alert, and thorax air bags for the rear seat are all options. New for 2013, IntelliLink is standard on all models; it connects your smartphone to an eight-inch touchscreen display and lets you stream music through your phone from Pandora and other Internet-based services.

Every one of them is powered by a 6.2-liter V-8 engine. And if you have a taste for irony, there’s the Escalade Hybrid. Its fuel economy is a fifty percent improvement on the standard model. The ESV is the extended-length version of this SUV, and it’s twenty-one inches longer than the standard model, which is already 202.5 inches long. An eight-inch flip-down screen will help amuse passengers in the third row of the ESV, or take out the third row altogether, fold down the second row, and amuse yourself with 137.4 cubic feet of cargo room. For 2013, the Escalade gets several new metallic paint choices, including Midnight Plum, which is coming later in the year. Even more decorative is the Platinum model, with decorative French seams on the instrument panel, center console, and door trim, plus wood inlays, aniline leather-trimmed seats, heated and cooled cup holders (!), a power lift gate, and a plethora of Cadillac wreath-and-crest logos.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 6.5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors: </strong><br />\n1.

It continues to be a popular choice for families, especially since it can be customized for shoppers on a budget or for those willing to pay more for extras. The base model starts at under $25,000 and is well-equipped. There are three engine choices: a 175-horsepower 2.4-liter inline four-cylinder engine, a 191-horsepower 2.4-liter inline four-cylinder, or a 276-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6. All are linked to a six-speed automatic transmission. The Sorento has an optional third row and seats up to seven passengers. One downside: not only is the third-row cramped, but the side curtain airbag does not cover passengers seated there. Kia continues to up the ante with extras on Sorento. The popular Sorento EX gets standard leather seating trim for the new model year and there is now a standard third-row seat for the Sorento LX V-6. Later in the model year, Kia said it will offer a new LX Convenience Plus Package that bundles an eight-way power driver’s seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, floor mats, and a first-aid kit. The “Buy American” crowd can take heart knowing that the Sorento is built in West Point, Georgia.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

E-150, E-250 Super Duty, and E-350 Super Duty versions are available in both standard and extended lengths and in both wagon (passenger vehicle) and van (work truck) versions. In wagon form, there are side windows, while the van version’s sides are an unbroken expanse of sheet metal other than the front-seat side windows. Even though the E-Series has been around forever, there are modern conveniences including anti-lock brakes, a navigation system with 6.5-inch touchscreen, and Ford’s Sync hands-free telematics system. The Crew Chief system is an option that helps commercial users manage a fleet of vehicles and the related data such as fuel usage and maintenance records. There’s nothing lyrical about an E-Series, unless you have a whole lot of stuff to cart around, in which case its capaciousness could just be music to your ears.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 2","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The color palette for the Ford Fiesta is saucy, including choices such as Lime Squeeze and Blue Candy, and you can get interior ambient lighting in seven colors that you can change at will. It has unexpectedly great perks for a subcompact: Ford’s hands-free Sync technology, leather-trimmed seats, push-button start. Even better, the U.S. Fiesta has virtually the same suspension setup as the European model, which means that it handles well and gives you a dynamic driving experience. Your good time behind the wheel is enhanced by knowing that you’re getting great fuel economy: 29 mpg in town and 38 to 40 mpg on the highway, with that higher number accompanying the optional SFE fuel economy package. All that and good looks, too! You might almost be OK with the fact that storage capacity is pretty limited compared with other cars in its category--a mere 12.8 cubic feet for the sedan and up to 26.0 cubic feet in the hatchback with the rear seats down. There’s only one engine choice, a 1.6-liter, 120-horsepower four-cylinder, but two transmission choices: a five-speed manual and a six-speed automatic that’s a little more fuel efficient.

What a change from the frumpmobile that was the previous Focus.  You can get a sedan or a hatchback, both with four doors and both undeniably easy on the eyes.  Inside, you’ll find a surprisingly comfortable interior both for seating and for cabin amenities. These days, you might be even more impressed to know that a Super Fuel Economy version gets 40 mpg on the highway (and 28 mpg around town). That SFE model comes with the six-speed PowerShift automatic transmission. With a five-speed manual transmission, the standard Focus’s fuel economy is actually lower, although still impressive, at 26 mpg in town and 36 mpg on the highway. Available options include active park assist, Ford’s Sync telematics system with MyFord Touch touchscreen and voice-activated navigation, and an anti-theft engine immobilizer. As attractive as the compact Focus is, there are even more choices in the lineup. There’s the Focus Electric, Ford’s first all-electric vehicle, with a miles per gallon equivalent rating of  110 MPGe city and 99 MPGe highway—and the ability to recharge in as little as four hours.  On the other extreme, the Focus ST is coming later in the year and will offer a turbo four-cylinder engine and sporty performance, optional two-tone Recaro racing seats, and a performance instrument cluster.  Ford says more than 10 million Focus cars have been sold since the first one came out in 1998, and the company is definitely going in the right direction to make that number keep moving upward.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

It comes with luxury-car features such as remote start, power telescoping mirrors, power adjustable pedals, and Ford’s Sync and MyFord Touch navigation. You’ve got to admire the fact that the controls and knobs are set up to be used by someone wearing thick work gloves. The Super Duty can be configured in many ways: with a six- or eight-foot bed, single or dual rear wheels, in regular, SuperCab, or SuperCrew body styles, and with a gasoline V-8 or the aforementioned turbo-diesel.

For 2013, Ford has given the car a face-lift and added technological appeal. Torque vectoring control and curve control will add to driving fun as well as make the car safer, and a newly optional 2.0-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine means the Taurus should get up to 31 mpg on the highway. Even with the standard 3.5-liter V-6, you should look for 19 mpg in town and 29 mpg on the highway, improved numbers and not bad for a capacious sedan. Both engines come with a six-speed automatic transmission. Among the options: a rearview camera, intelligent access with push-button start, a heated steering wheel, and multicontour seats with “subtle rolling massage.” Taurus and “subtle” do go well together. However, if you are feeling a little less subtle yourself, there’s the Taurus SHO, which has an aggressive front end dressed in black mesh, plus bigger brakes and a Performance package that includes a set of twenty-inch wheels.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 4","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

(These latter two items can be added at no cost, but R owners will just have to live with the rope burn.) The R is motivated by a 330-horsepower 3.4-liter flat six-cylinder, with output modulated through a six-speed manual transmission. The base model Cayman comes with a 265-horsepower, 2.9-liter flat six, while the Cayman S has a slightly less prodigious versions of the larger engine. A fast-shifting, seven-speed dual-clutch automatic is available. While the R is for hardcore enthusiasts who participate in track day events, the three other models can be equipped with infotainment hardware and fitted with luxurious touches.

What else is about eight inches shorter than a Honda Odyssey minivan but only seats four people? Brilliant! Over an approximately $100,000 range from low to high in sticker prices, there are six models: Panamera, S, 4, 4S, GTS, S Hybrid, Turbo, and Turbo S. Engines range from a 300-horsepower V-6 that will hurl this car to 160 mph, to the 550-horsepower turbocharged 4.8-liter V-8 that NASA couldn’t get for spaceflight. It’s also available with all-wheel drive. Meanwhile, the S Hybrid achieves 30 mpg and a modicum of respectability at the e-waste drop-off site. The Hybrid is equipped with an eight-speed. Of course you can expect every safety, driver-assistance, chassis-control, and comfort feature available in the Porsche arsenal; then also imagine paint and leather upholstery that matches your own beloved sample.

It has Honda’s nicely-tuned suspension, and the V-6 engine can tow up to 4,500 pounds when paired with available four-wheel drive. With three rows of seats, the Pilot can seat up to eight people; or with the seats down, it can fit a whole lot of cargo. A 2012 overhaul left the Pilot with a more streamlined and logical control panel and an  easy-to-use navigation and entertainment system. At 17 to 18 mpg in the city and 24 to 25 on the highway, the Pilot is relatively efficient for its size but still not as efficient as the Odyssey. Typical of the Honda brand, the Pilot is known for its reliability and utility. It is one of the best-selling vehicles in its category, even outdoing cars that are better looking and more powerful than the boxy Pilot. Like Honda’s other utility vehicles, the Pilot can be pricey. The base price for the cheapest model is almost $30,000, and the price range tops out above $41,000, making the Pilot one of only two Hondas with a base price that high, but if you can get past the price and polarizing exterior styling, the Pilot is a versatile choice.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

Also new for 2013 will be a Jetta Hybrid, to be released in the fall. Volkswagen expects the car to get 45 mpg, but what they’re really excited about is the hybrid’s ability to reach speeds of up to 185 miles per hour, making it the world’s fastest hybrid (so far). You won’t get great gas mileage going that fast, but you will have the pleasure of knowing that your car could blast anyone else’s out of the park, if you weren’t stuck in gridlock. If hybrids aren’t your speed, the Jetta also offers a fuel-efficient diesel model and a performance-friendly GLI trim level.

The XV Crosstrek offers rear seat legroom close to that of a mid-size vehicle. If you want to feel good about saving the environment while driving, this is the car for you. The XV Crosstrek is built in a zero landfill plant and is a partial zero emissions vehicle. You’ll also feel good getting close to 33 MPG with the larger gas tank. The XV Crosstrek comes with two transmission choices: a five-speed manual transmission and an automatic with manual control mode and steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters. The XV Crosstrek will keep you and your occupants safe, coming standard with Subaru’s advanced frontal airbag system. This system is equipped with airbags that can sense how close you are to the airbag.
