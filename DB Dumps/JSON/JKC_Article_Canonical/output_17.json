The Model S, a battery-electric vehicle, combined an unprecedented level of innovation, technology, design, and quality when it was fresh out of the box. Indeed, this American luxury sedan with a rear-mounted motor driving the rear wheels matched up well in style and pace against the European competition. But for 2015, Tesla has addressed some opportunities and achieved a worldwide first for production vehicles. To improve performance, a second motor, placed in front and driving the front wheels, is available. With 691 horsepower and all-wheel drive, the P85D whooshes from 0 to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds, achieves a top speed of 155 mph, and cruises as far as 253 miles. The P85D sits atop the range, which includes the Model S 70D and Model S 85, named for their 70- and 85-kilowatt-hour batteries supplying current to a 329- and 362-horsepower motors, respectively. The fourth model is the 85D, which benefits from the dual-motor layout but has a milder attitude with 422 horsepower; nevertheless, it will also go 155 mph. Besides hot-rodding the Model S, Tesla shows a unique twist on active safety with the available Autopilot, an artificial intelligence application that permits hands-free lane-keeping, changing of lanes, and parking. Software updates add new capabilities to the system. The Model S has a gorgeous, spacious interior with the ultimate in touchscreens, a seventeen-incher that will dazzle your passengers. And the shapely body includes features like “zero profile” door handles that recede into their housings; the P85D has a charge port in the left rear that automatically opens when it senses a charging connector’s proximity. The Model S is a breakthrough car that just keeps getting better.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"The P85D sits atop the range, which includes the Model S 70D and Model S 85, named for their 70- and 85-kilowatt-hour batteries supplying current to a 329- and 362-horsepower motors, respectively.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-06T13:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"8-track-credit-promolarge-czmarlin","title":"8 Track Credit Promolarge Czmarlin","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/134729231/8-track-credit-promolarge-CZMarlin.jpg","fileMasterId":134729231,"fileName":"8-track-credit-promolarge-CZMarlin.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-06T13:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"8-track-credit-promolarge-czmarlin","title":"8 Track Credit Promolarge Czmarlin","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/134729231/8-track-credit-promolarge-CZMarlin.jpg","fileMasterId":134729231,"fileName":"8-track-credit-promolarge-CZMarlin.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-06T13:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"8-track-credit-header-czmarlin","title":"8 Track Credit Header Czmarlin","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/134729054/8-track-credit-header-CZMarlin.jpg","fileMasterId":134729054,"fileName":"8-track-credit-header-CZMarlin.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":954881,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Lifestyle factors and improving technology have changed how we maintain, accessorize, and adorn our cars.

As the water evaporated by the force of wind, cool air came inside. (Of course, it only worked when the car was moving.) Packard introduced an integrated refrigerated air conditioning system in 1939, charging a whopping $274 for the option. (A new Ford cost as little as $660 that year.)

The seat cushion has evolved to an advanced state, namely, the polyester and foam unit that plugs into the twelve-volt adapter and blows cool air through internal vents. That’s great for thrashing around in an older car. Much more effective heated and cooled seats are available in a wide variety of new cars.

In response, cars and trucks teamed up in convoys to drive faster. Around the same time, accessory eight-track tape decks were mounted below dashboards. Great for Aerosmith, bad for knees. Currently, speed limits as high as 85 mph in some places now have drivers singing a happy tune, no longer calling out a CB handle such as River Rat or Cycle Smoker. As autonomous vehicle technology spreads, cars will talk to one another. As for Aerosmith, Bluetooth streaming delivers them from your iPod to the audio system.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Rambler American 1St Generation Black Sedan Credit Czmarlin","caption":"","fileMasterId":134729249,"fileName":"rambler-american-1st-generation-black-sedan-credit-CZMarlin.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/134729249/rambler-american-1st-generation-black-sedan-credit-CZMarlin.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":6,"text":"<h3>6.

This rear-wheel-drive subcompact is available as a coupe or convertible, and it delivers excellent driving dynamics, performance, fuel economy, and technology in a smaller package than its 3 Series sibling. On the downside, it seats only four. But buyers are more likely buying this car for its engineering than its people shuttling and cargo capacity (which at almost 14 cubic feet is quite good), and they’ll be pleased with its standard turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces a more than ample 240 horsepower. It’s also one of the dwindling stock of rear-wheel-drive vehicles available with a six-speed manual transmission, and yet for the winter-weather dwellers, it’s also offered with xDrive. The interior is high end, but you’ll pay extra for most bells and whistles. Dual-zone climate control and a 6.5-inch LCD screen are standard, but navigation, a rearview camera, park assist, a cruise control system with braking function, and phone and app integration are all extra. Performance-minded buyers can bump up to the M—also still available with a manual transmission—and get the turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine that produces 320 horsepower and 330 pound-feet of torque, producing an impressive power-to-weight ratio.

One of the most noticeable changes is that the X6 has increased its seating capacity from four to five. The first-generation vehicle sat only two in the rear, and the second row now can seat three across. Front and rear passengers will enjoy a bit more headroom, and while legroom is unchanged for the front row, the rear passengers will have two inches more to stretch their legs.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

And you can carry a lot of stuff with you: With the rear seats folded, the XC70 offers a generous 72.1 cubic feet of cargo space. In some trim levels, the front passenger seat also folds forward, expanding cargo capacity even further.\n<br><br>\nVolvo has added what it calls Drive-E technology across its lineup, and the XC70 is no exception. What that means is that there is an all-new, 240-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder and eight-speed automatic transmission teamed with ECO+, a fuel-saving technology that uses auto stop/start and other measures to improve gas mileage. The four-cylinder is only available with front-wheel drive, however, so anyone planning to use their XC70 for off-road adventures will have to settle for one of the six-cylinder engines, which are paired with all-wheel drive. We suggest skipping the 240-horsepower 3.2-liter unit, which is being phased out across the Volvo lineup, and going for the 300-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder.\n<br><br>\nThe XC70’s interior boasts the same ultra-supportive seats found in every Volvo—anyone with a bad back would do well to give them a test. Ergonomically, the XC70 is hard to beat, with intuitive controls, like the climate controls shaped like a human—press the legs to direct air to the lower extremities, press the head to direct air out the upper vents, etc.  Mid-year, Volvo introduced a few new standard features, including a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a six-month subscription for On Call, a smartphone app that allows you to control your car remotely. There is also an overhead button in the cabin, similar to GM’s OnStar, that serves as an SOS should you need emergency assistance.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nRevised standard and optional features, and an available 240-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder with automatic stop/start technology and an eight-speed automatic transmission.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volvo XC70","fileMasterId":132184931,"fileName":"volvo-xc70-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132184931/volvo-xc70-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volvo XC70","fileMasterId":132184928,"fileName":"volvo-xc70-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132184928/volvo-xc70-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volvo XC70","fileMasterId":132184925,"fileName":"volvo-xc70-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132184925/volvo-xc70-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":46143,"make":"Volvo","model":"XC70","year":2015},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:36:08.160-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547768161 }} },{ "_id":695459,"title":"2016 Hyundai Tucson","subTitle":"Strong player in the competitive crossover game.","slug":"2016-hyundai-tucson","promoTitle":"2016 Hyundai Tucson","promoTeaserSmall":"Strong player in the competitive crossover game.","promoTeaser":"Strong player in the competitive crossover game.","keywords":["2016 Hyundai Tucson"],"metaTitle":"2016 Hyundai Tucson -

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Just a look at the materials list is exciting: a lightweight but strong carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic body—quite unusual for a non-sports car—enclosing interior panels made out of renewable Asian kenaf plants, and topped off by eucalyptus wood trim to complement the soft leather seating. And it’s not just the unusual materials, it’s the manner in which they are arrayed. The eucalyptus sheets are asymmetrically applied and bent in supple curves. The information screen appears to float in midair above the low cowl.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"It’s beautiful. It’s inspirational. It’s groundbreaking.

BMW addresses that with a range extender at an additional cost of $3,850. The range extender is a generator powered by a little two-cylinder gas engine that comes from a BMW motor scooter. Its job is not to drive the wheels; it’s to kick in when the electricity dips below a certain charge, and then maintain that charge. You can drive a mere seventy-two miles on a charge without it, and double that to 150 miles with it. One caveat: You really don’t want to plan a long trip; the gas engine’s 1.9-gallon capacity will have you stopping for tiny little fill-ups every, oh, seventy-five miles or so. I would say put the range extender at the top of your optional equipment list.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"Then you’ll want to accessorize with the BMW iCharging station for your garage, at another additional cost ($1,080) that doesn’t include installation.

It’s perhaps unfair to quibble, since you’d expect a car this small to be more of a city car, but I’m here to say that it completely handles the freeway. It is able to blow by the surrounding traffic with ease, in the all-in way that electric vehicles give you everything they have the second you hit the go pedal. The difference between lesser electrics and the i3 is that you don’t feel like it’s going to explode because you’re going too fast at 70 mph. What did happen in my test car at a steady 70 mph was a small but disconcerting side-to-side front-end drift.

In city driving, though, the fun jumps to a solid 9.5. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"The i3 I drove was well equipped, although still not fully loaded, even at $47,210. It featured the Giga World package ($1,500), which adds keyless entry, a universal garage door opener, and a set of 19-inch alloy wheels. Its stunner of a Solar Orange/Frozen Grey two-tone paint job was an additional $500. The Tech + Driving Assist package ($2,500) gives you navigation, adaptive cruise control, BMW online and BMW apps, and advanced real-time traffic information. Not present on our i3 were a Harman Kardon sound system ($800) or a set of 20-inch alloy wheels ($1,300). ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"It’s questionable, the value of spending this kind of money for an EV when gas prices seem to be on a lowering trend.

Its fuel efficiency bests that of the Enclave by about eight mph. As far as features go, Buick did not skimp. OnStar, cruise control, ambient lighting, rearview camera, full-color display, and leather-wrapped steering wheel all come standard.

Even bigger news is the arrival of the twin-turbo ATS-V performance version as a coupe or sedan, upping the ATS desirability level considerably. You get a choice of normally aspirated or turbocharged four-cylinder engines along with that V-6, and there are sedan and coupe body styles to choose from.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Soapbox","id":1034787,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/soapbox","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-22T18:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"vw-promlarge2","title":"Vw Promlarge2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146804882/vw-promlarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":146804882,"fileName":"vw-promlarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-22T18:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"vw-promlarge2","title":"Vw Promlarge2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146804882/vw-promlarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":146804882,"fileName":"vw-promlarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-22T18:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"vw-header2","title":"Vw Header2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146804633/vw-header2.jpg","fileMasterId":146804633,"fileName":"vw-header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":965893,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Vw 3","caption":"","fileMasterId":146905424,"fileName":"vw-3.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146905424/vw-3.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":0,"text":"I have a front-row seat in the unfolding Volkswagen diesel drama.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"I not only own a <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/at-home/2015-volkswagen-golf-sportwagen-jeans-driveway/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 VW Golf SportWagen TDI</a>, I sold a 2013 VW Jetta SportWagen TDI to a good friend on the East Coast.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-17T19:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-promo","title":"2016 Toyota Rav4 Hybrid Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91905033/2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":91905033,"fileName":"2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-17T19:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-promo","title":"2016 Toyota Rav4 Hybrid Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91905033/2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":91905033,"fileName":"2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-17T19:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-header","title":"2016 Toyota Rav4 Hybrid Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91905201/2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-header.jpg","fileMasterId":91905201,"fileName":"2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":976509,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> All-wheel-drive, five-passenger, four-door crossover utility vehicle <br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> Hybrid XLE, Hybrid Limited <br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $34,510 (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $36,560<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.5-liter four-cylinder with electric motor, 194 combined horsepower <br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Continuously variable automatic <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 34 mpg city/31 mpg highway/33 mpg combined <br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Search-Results?searchtype=model&make=TOYOTA&model=RAV4&year=2016\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">5/5 stars</a>; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: Not yet rated  \n<br>\n<strong>Favorite standard feature:</strong> Height-adjustable power liftgate <br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Trailer sway control, hill start assist, eighteen-inch alloy wheels, LED exterior lighting, heated outside mirrors with integrated turn signal and blind-spot warning indicators, blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert,  Toyota Safety Sense suite of driver-assistance features, seven-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth and iPod connectivity, premium audio <br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Hyundai Tucson, Kia Sportage, Chevrolet Equinox  <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"1998001 1998 RAV4  1","caption":"","fileMasterId":160299098,"fileName":"1998001-1998-RAV4--1-.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160299098/1998001-1998-RAV4--1-.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":321},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Twenty years ago, the Toyota RAV4 helped to change our way of thinking about compact vehicles.</strong> As a “cute ute,” the RAV4 offered a high seating position, great maneuverability, and more utility than compact sedans.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-19T09:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"subaru-impreza-homepage","title":"Subaru Impreza Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91949688/subaru-impreza-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":91949688,"fileName":"subaru-impreza-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-19T09:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"subaru-impreza-homepage","title":"Subaru Impreza Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91949688/subaru-impreza-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":91949688,"fileName":"subaru-impreza-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-19T09:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"subaru-impreza-header","title":"Subaru Impreza Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95006923/subaru-impreza-header.jpg","fileMasterId":95006923,"fileName":"subaru-impreza-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":977661,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Four-door, five-passenger sedan <br>\r\n<strong>Release date:</strong> Late 2016 as 2017 model<br>\r\n<strong>Estimated price:</strong> $22,000 <br>\r\n<strong>Competes against:</strong> Honda Civic, Ford Focus, Chevrolet Cruze <br>\r\n<strong>What’s most interesting:</strong> Unprecedented aggressiveness of Subaru design <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Subaru will no longer play nice.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Four-way stops have their own issues, which in fact are the same issues that bother me in every kind of driving: selfish drivers who don't honor the social contract to take turns. All those people who zoom ahead in the lane that's about to close, then want to forcibly insert themselves in front of you.

All of these advancements have saved lives and the roundabouts that have long been common in Europe have burst onto American soil to save our lives with an added benefit of reducing traffic congestion.<br>\n<br>\nThe roundabouts are here to stay, so it is time you stopped avoiding them and start to embrace them. I wholeheartedly agree they are a bit daunting at first. I especially dislike the double roundabout just north of Ann Arbor at the freeway interchange.

My daughter, then ten years old, was starving and sobbing in the back seat as the restaurant receded in the background. We could see the food; we just couldn't get to it.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034953,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/car-on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-21T08:51:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"accord-promolarge","title":"Accord Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95838924/accord-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":95838924,"fileName":"accord-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-21T08:51:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"accord-promolarge","title":"Accord Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95838924/accord-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":95838924,"fileName":"accord-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-21T08:51:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"accord-header","title":"Accord Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/168813980/accord-header.jpg","fileMasterId":168813980,"fileName":"accord-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":982433,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Welcome to Five Cool Things from <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">JeanKnowsCars.com!</a></strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmQumdw_kCQ?autoplay=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"The Honda Accord is one of America's most respected sedans.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Lunacy","id":1034778,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-lunacy","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-29T10:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"promo","title":"Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/165264065/promo.jpg","fileMasterId":165264065,"fileName":"promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-29T10:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"promo","title":"Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/165264065/promo.jpg","fileMasterId":165264065,"fileName":"promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-29T10:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"header","title":"Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/165264068/header.jpg","fileMasterId":165264068,"fileName":"header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":983292,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Jean Knows Cars, with backing from mighty Tribune Publishing, moved into 318 North Main, a 1915 annex to Chelsea’s historic Clocktower, in January 2015.</strong> We’d been working out of a Panera restaurant, a local Ann Arbor vegan restaurant called Seva, Molly Jean’s kitchen table, and Laura Sky Brown’s kitchen table for several months, so it was a Big Deal.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-08T10:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lexus-promolarge","title":"Lexus Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/167958689/lexus-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":167958689,"fileName":"lexus-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-08T10:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lexus-promolarge","title":"Lexus Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/167958689/lexus-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":167958689,"fileName":"lexus-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-08T10:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-lexus-rx-header","title":"2016 Lexus Rx Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/167958632/2016-lexus-rx-header.jpg","fileMasterId":167958632,"fileName":"2016-lexus-rx-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":984476,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, front- or all-wheel-drive luxury crossover<br>\r\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> RX350, RX350 F Sport<br>\r\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $43,800 (prices include destination charge)<br>\r\n<strong>This car:</strong> $54,755<br>\r\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.5-liter V-6, 295 horsepower<br>\r\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Eight-speed automatic<br>\r\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 20 mpg city/28 mpg highway<br>\r\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: Not yet rated; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: Not yet rated<br>\r\n<strong>Competition</strong> (all prices include destination charges):<br>\r\n2016 Audi Q5 Premium ($40,900)<br>\r\n2016 BMW X3 sDrive 28i ($39,945)<br>\r\n2016 Lincoln MKX ($39,185)<br>\r\n2016 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 ($40,800)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong>  5 <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2016 Lexus Rx 12","caption":"","fileMasterId":167958659,"fileName":"2016-lexus-rx-12.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/167958659/2016-lexus-rx-12.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>It’s possible that you will never get used to the look of the 2016 Lexus RX350.</strong> The side profile looks like it was in a sword fight.

The way the whole interior is put together, from the carbon fiber strips to the nappy black pig suede materials, is first-rate. Someone knows what they’re doing in the interior design department. The use of the materials exudes beautifully executed luxury. The seats evoke the exterior’s folded-airplane design, and they’re super comfortable and very supportive.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":25,"text":"The Cadillac ATS-V we tested carried $14,000 worth of options. The reason the paddle shifters feel so good is that they’re magnesium, and they’re part of the eight-speed automatic $2,000 option that comes with adaptive remote start. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":26,"text":"The $6,195 Track Performance package has little to do with actual performance. It has an extra, low-mass battery, and everything else in the package is about cutting weight. The package deletes floor mats, tire sealant and inflator kit, and a tow hook. It adds carbon fiber front splitter, air extractor, and rear diffuser, plus composite black rocker extensions and a body-color rear spoiler. None of that has anything to do with the engine or brakes; it’s a primarily visual package with two extra pieces that have something to do with lowering weight. The ATS-V does look awesome with this package, but I don’t know if it adds $6,200 worth of awesome. But if you’re spending $60,000 already….","type":"paragraph"},{"order":27,"text":"As for the other options, the Recaro seats would be hard to give up, even though they are priced at $2,300. The spectacular Red Obsession Tintcoat paint job adds $995. The wheels are polished but have red Brembo calipers behind them, which is an extra $595 but it actually means something: not only are they really cool-looking in red, they’re the hottest brand of brakes that make the difference between performance and non-performance cars. A Corvette wouldn’t be caught dead without Brembo brakes.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":28,"text":"Cadillac Cue with Bose surround sound and navigation adds $1,085. If you want nav, you have to get Cue. As everyone should know by now about GM products, the OnStar five-year basic plan is included as standard, and so is the 4G LTE hot spot with a limited data trial.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":29,"text":"<h3>The Verdict</h3>\r\nBetween the ATS-V and the CTS-V, Cadillac really has something to take to the track and to the performance competition from Europe. The CTS-V is a little less comfortable to me on a day-to-day basis. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":30,"text":"The first ATS was more of a Lincoln competitor, although it had BMW 3 Series aspirations, as do all cars in this class.

If you were considering a BMW, Audi, or Mercedes-Benz, make sure you look at this car. It has a much fresher design, an American feel, a powerful engine, and a highly attractive interior. This is America’s first true head-to-head competitor against the cars the car enthusiasts have been holding up as the bar.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":33,"text":"How fun is this car?

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Designer Walkaround","id":1034952,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-21T11:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chrysler-pacifica--promolarge","title":"Chrysler Pacifica  Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98750473/chrysler-pacifica--promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":98750473,"fileName":"chrysler-pacifica--promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-21T11:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chrysler-pacifica--promolarge","title":"Chrysler Pacifica  Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98750473/chrysler-pacifica--promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":98750473,"fileName":"chrysler-pacifica--promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-21T11:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chrysler-pacifica-header","title":"Chrysler Pacifica Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/168821594/chrysler-pacifica-header.jpg","fileMasterId":168821594,"fileName":"chrysler-pacifica-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":986483,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>I've known Ralph since he joined Chrysler, and to see his growth as a leader in the design community has been very gratifying.</strong> This has been recognized by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles; he was just promoted to the position of global design chief of the FCA Group, succeeding the formidable Lorenzo Ramaciotti. <br>\n<br>\nOne of the things I like most about Ralph is that he also really knows how to enjoy himself and his vehicles.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-02-03T12:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"tire-homepage","title":"Tire Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/99484933/tire-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":99484933,"fileName":"tire-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-02-03T12:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"tire-homepage","title":"Tire Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/99484933/tire-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":99484933,"fileName":"tire-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-02-03T12:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"tire-header","title":"Tire Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/99484879/tire-header.jpg","fileMasterId":99484879,"fileName":"tire-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":988453,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"You’ve heard of snow tires.

If you enter your vehicle’s specs and your itinerary, it will give you an estimate of the cost of gas for your trip.

For our trip we are using <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Airbnb</a> to book our rooms to try and stay at some unique places.

Set Your Route</h3>\nA huge part of a successful road trip starts with planning the route. Once you pick the destination, you have to decide if you are going directly, or do you have time for some stops along the way. Another big decision is the type of road that you want to drive on—all Interstate or highway, or possibly a combination. There are many apps available to make it easy to plan. I used <a href=\"http://www.roadtrippers.com\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">roadtrippers.com</a> to find and add sightseeing opportunities along the way. Start exploring the route ahead of time so you have an adequate amount of time to explore your options. This advance planning will make the trip run a whole lot smoother, and for first-timers like me, it will help make your parents happy. But be flexible when you are on your trip if for some reason you need to take a detour.

Chances are you will never need it, but it may prove to be a lifesaver. If I break down, my first call will be to my roadside assistance, but there are circumstances where you need to be prepared to take care of yourself. It is also helpful to stash a few items to cleanup spills in the car in your emergency kit. After all,  if you spill a soda in your lap, that is truly an emergency.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

And as always, being a Buick, the LaCrosse represents a sensible value equation, even when it’s loaded with luxury, convenience, and safety features. Otherwise, it doesn’t much resemble the Buicks of yore. It comes with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine that’s aided by the “mild hybrid” eAssist feature, an electric drive system that delivers an extra shove in support of the combustion engine. That means 36 highway mpg—really good for a car its size. The optional engine is the nice 3.6-liter V-6, and it can be paired with all-wheel drive for a sure-footedness that the good country doctor didn’t enjoy more than 100 years ago when making house calls in his Buick Model 10. The LaCrosse is everything Buick has always stood for: substantial, discreetly well appointed, durable, and a good value. What’s different is all the advanced electronic systems and features that keep you squarely in your lane while also keeping you in touch and in tunes.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nOnStar with 4G LTE and standard WiFi hot spot, improved IntelliLink, four-way adjustable front-seat headrests, new exterior colors, standard rearview camera","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Buick LaCrosse interior","fileMasterId":103969706,"fileName":"buick-lacrosse-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103969706/buick-lacrosse-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Buick LaCrosse","fileMasterId":103969676,"fileName":"buick-lacrosse-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103969676/buick-lacrosse-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Buick LaCrosse","fileMasterId":103969703,"fileName":"buick-lacrosse-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103969703/buick-lacrosse-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45440,"make":"Buick","model":"LaCrosse","year":2015},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:36:43.142-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547803142 }} },{ "_id":673494,"title":"2015 Buick Enclave","subTitle":"Aging on good bones.","slug":"2015-buick-enclave","promoTitle":"2015 Buick Enclave","promoTeaserSmall":"Aging on good bones.","promoTeaser":"Aging on good bones.","keywords":["2015 Buick Enclave"],"metaTitle":"2015 Buick Enclave","metaKeywords":["2015 Buick Enclave; Buick; SUV; crossover; American"],"metaDescription":"Aging on good bones.

There’s no denying it has sedanlike (or even minivanlike) amenities, namely, eight air bags and rear seat entertainment including video screens.

The V-12 engine now makes 552 horsepower—that’s 18-percent better—and mates with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The car shoots from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds and reaches 203 mph. The even more advanced stability control adjusts for whatever pushbutton driving mode—normal, sport, or track—is selected. In typical Aston Martin fashion, the options for individualizing the car are nearly overwhelming, so you can choose colors, trim, wheels, and finishes just as you’d like. Then, to ensure that no one else’s Rapide S duplicates yours, specify the optional, personalized door sill plaques and use your nickname.

No, we’re not talking about muscle cars from Detroit. But the 2015 Aston Martin Vantage is up to those same tricks. It’s a good strategy for an older car. While forever beautiful, the Vantage is showing its age. Crinkles around the eyes, you know. The newest model, the Vantage GT, is the least expensive, starting at $102,525. It pays tribute to Aston’s racing heritage by wearing any of five multicolor schemes ranging from subtle to loud. Like every other Vantage, it’s available as a coupe or roadster. And like all other Vantage V8 models, it’s offered with a six-speed manual or seven-speed automatic, which can be operated via paddle shifters. And then there’s the amazing V12 Vantage S. The seven-speed is the only transmission here. We plopped into a Roadster on a beautiful autumn day, noted the weave of the carbon fiber shift paddles sparkling in the sun, savored the fragrant leather. Docking the beautiful glass “key,” we heard the dual exhausts deliver a message from Jove. As on the more expensive Vanquish, the beautifully lined convertible top operated quickly and without fuss. Driving the car over country roads made us forget all the world’s bad news, freed us from all that is coarse and mundane. There may be newer cars and more exciting technology, but the Vantage V12 Roadster will deliver an unforgettable experience with every drive.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nVantage GT coupe and roadster with six-speed manual or seven-speed automatic pay tribute to Aston Martin’s racing heritage while bringing down the entry-level price by about $20,000.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Aston Martin V12 Vantage S","fileMasterId":119408213,"fileName":"aston-martin-vantage-01-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119408213/aston-martin-vantage-01-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Aston Martin V12 Vantage S","fileMasterId":119408345,"fileName":"aston-martin-vantage-01-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119408345/aston-martin-vantage-01-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Aston Martin V12 Vantage S","fileMasterId":119408339,"fileName":"aston-martin-vantage-01-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119408339/aston-martin-vantage-01-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45707,"make":"Aston Martin","model":"V8 Vantage","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":39636,"make":"Aston Martin","model":"V12 Vantage","year":2015},{"id":"641bb9a2-17a1-3cc9-9585-5bd8468fcc24","type":"mediaTag","name":"Indulgence","path":"/Main/Indulgence"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:36:44.445-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547804445 }} },{ "_id":673560,"title":"2015 Fiat 500","subTitle":"A little something for everybody.","slug":"2015-fiat-500","promoTitle":"2015 Fiat 500","promoTeaserSmall":"A little something for everybody.","promoTeaser":"A little something for everybody.","keywords":["2015 Fiat 500"],"metaTitle":"2015 Fiat 500","metaKeywords":["2015 Fiat 500; Fiat; Italian; compact; coupe; convertible"],"metaDescription":"A little something for everybody.

Regardless of which model you choose, you are assured of the ability to express a glamorous, modern, or sporty aesthetic. For example, there is the new 500 Turbo that fits in between the tame 500 and snarling 500 Abarth. The battery-powered 500e, which is available in California and Oregon, offers range of more than 100 miles in urban driving and can reach 88 mph on the highway. Throughout the line, you choose between coupe or convertible with power-operated cloth top (500e not included) and work from a palette that includes some of the most fashion-forward hues in the automotive realm. Pop, Sport, and Lounge trims differentiate models even further. The Sport includes sixteen-inch wheels, aggressive body pieces, unique seats, and a powerful stereo. Besides these, the limited-production 1957 Edition invokes the Nuova 500 (New 500) that was a European smash hit back then. Cloaked in light blue, shod with matching dish wheels, and furnished within in brown and ivory leather, the 1957 Edition charmingly fulfills the mission of honoring its precursor. The 500 series represents so many things we love about cars: style, personality, economy, and performance. Like the Mini Cooper, it’s more expensive than, say, a Toyota Yaris, but you’re getting something extra special.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nSeven-inch high-definition display, Bluetooth streaming audio, additional USB port, high-definition audio, six-speed automatic transmission in the Abarth.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Fiat 500 interior","fileMasterId":103956485,"fileName":"fiat-500-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103956485/fiat-500-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Fiat 500","fileMasterId":103956428,"fileName":"fiat-500-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103956428/fiat-500-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Fiat 500","fileMasterId":103956479,"fileName":"fiat-500-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103956479/fiat-500-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Fiat 500</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/car-on-the-road/arrivederci-fiat-500/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Arrivederci, Fiat 500</a> September 18, 2013","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43596,"make":"Fiat","model":"500","year":2015},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:36:44.909-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547804909 }} },{ "_id":673561,"title":"2015 Ford Edge Sport","subTitle":"The mid-size crossover gets big improvements.

The 4Runner’s exterior has been refined over the years, but it maintains a tough look. The cabin combines rugged, squared-off styling cues with more refined touches like contrast stitching on the doors. All 4Runner models now come standard with Toyota’s Entune mulitmedia system that includes satellite radio, iPod connectivity, and Bluetooth, and on Limited models, access to mobile apps and data services. Old friends of 4Runners gone by will be happy to see the base SR5 comes with fog lights, skidplates, roof rails, and other off-road-ready gear. The 4Runner’s hatch can hold 47.2 cubic feet of cargo and up to 89.7 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. Go ahead and spring for the more versatile 4x4, since the added pounds have only a marginal effect on fuel economy.

Next up is the LE Plus that adds on conveniences like a power liftgate, three-zone climate control, and an eight-way power driver’s seat that includes lumbar support. If you want a moonroof, you’ll have to move up to the XLE, Limited, or Limited Platinum. There are two Limited packages available on both the standard and hybrid Highlanders. Depending on which package you choose, tech helpers like blind spot monitoring with cross traffic alert, a rear parking sensor, pre-collision system, and emergency assistance are available, some as options.

The 2015 exterior refresh includes slimmer headlights and sharper front grille. Inside, Sienna veterans will appreciate the new more cohesive dash design. Gone is the asymmetrical swoop in the dash to make way for a thoughtful, driver-oriented center panel that facilitates efficient use of the various controls like the three-zone climate system and displays for multi-media and navigation. Several trims are available beginning with the base L starting at just over $30,000, and climaxing with the Limited trim that will put you well over $40,000. All-wheel drive is available on several models, LE, XLE and Limited, and those with more sporting aspirations will gravitate toward the SE trim and its sport-tuned suspension and more aggressive exterior accents. With the second-row bench and the third row upright, the Sienna can carry eight passengers. If you choose the second-row captain’s chairs, that number is reduced to seven. Should those passengers get out of hand, you have a new ally in the ground-breaking Driver Easy Speak option.

Chances are you will be just as interested in making a bit of a lifestyle statement as a financial decision, if you're interested in a ForTwo.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<strong>New for 2016:</strong> The ForTwo is all new for 2016.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More to Read:</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/events/smart-electric-city-tour/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Electric City Tour</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Smart ForTwo.","fileMasterId":102464036,"fileName":"smart-fortwo-06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/102464036/smart-fortwo-06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Smart ForTwo.","fileMasterId":102464033,"fileName":"smart-fortwo-05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/102464033/smart-fortwo-05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Smart ForTwo.","fileMasterId":102464027,"fileName":"smart-fortwo-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/102464027/smart-fortwo-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Smart ForTwo.","fileMasterId":102464054,"fileName":"smart-fortwo-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/102464054/smart-fortwo-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Smart CEO Dr. Annette Winkler introduced the 2016 ForTwo at the New York Auto Show this spring.","fileMasterId":102464024,"fileName":"smart-fortwo-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/102464024/smart-fortwo-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Smart ForTwo.","fileMasterId":102464021,"fileName":"smart-fortwo-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/102464021/smart-fortwo-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Smart ForTwo.","fileMasterId":155562020,"fileName":"2016-smart-fortwo--33-.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/155562020/2016-smart-fortwo--33-.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":411},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Smart ForTwo.","fileMasterId":102464021,"fileName":"smart-fortwo-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/102464021/smart-fortwo-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":5,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45248,"make":"Smart","model":"fortwo","year":2016},{"id":"71d39f07-0bc5-39bd-9468-12085dc13b7c","type":"mediaTag","name":"First_Car","path":"/Main/First_Car"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:36:48.639-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547808640 }} },{ "_id":678489,"title":"2015 Kia Cadenza","subTitle":"Near luxury, far cries of satisfaction.","slug":"2015-kia-cadenza","promoTitle":"2015 Kia Cadenza","promoTeaserSmall":"Near luxury, far cries of satisfaction.","promoTeaser":"Near luxury, far cries of satisfaction.","keywords":["2015 Kia Cadenza"],"metaTitle":"2015 Kia Cadenza","metaKeywords":["2015 Kia Cadenza; Kia; sedan; Korean"],"metaDescription":"Near luxury, far cries of satisfaction.

But the direct-injection engine is potent, and those paddle shifters are pretty sporty. While you’re not falling too far behind the more renowned sport sedans on the road, you’ll be smiling about all the standard equipment at your fingertips. With a 10-way power-adjustable heated leather driver’s seat and seven-inch driver information display, the Cadenza Premium is well stocked with creature comforts. <br><br>A host of driver assistance and safety systems are standard, and a seven-inch TFT display and a heated steering wheel are optional. The Cadenza Limited adopts those features as standard and adds all sorts of additional niceties, from timekeeping (an exclusive analog clock) and interior lighting to additional driver-assistance features like lane keeping, blind-spot detection, and smart cruise control. The Limited also includes ventilated front seats and heated outboard rear seats with Nappa leather trim. The steering wheel’s position is power-adjustable as well. It’s hard to find fault with the Cadenza. The interior is huge, yet the car has a reasonable footprint and looks quite sleek and smart, if somewhat anonymous. What it lacks is razzle-dazzle, the glossy reputation of a BMW, but for some folks, that’s just fine.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nFront grille, surround view monitor, panoramic sunroof,  eight-way power front passenger seat, available rear cross-traffic alert and other driver assistance features.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Cadenza interior","fileMasterId":103919270,"fileName":"kia-cadenza-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103919270/kia-cadenza-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Cadenza","fileMasterId":103919450,"fileName":"kia-cadenza-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103919450/kia-cadenza-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":48793,"make":"Kia","model":"Cadenza","year":2015},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:36:48.857-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547808857 }} } ]
