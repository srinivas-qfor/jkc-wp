These kits can be charged in a wall outlet and then used to jump a car battery in just a few minutes, offering peace of mind if you or loved ones are traveling in remote or dangerous areas.

The company announced at the Los Angeles Auto Show that, on January 15, the 2014 Accord Plug-In Hybrid (PHEV) will hit showrooms in New York and California. The new Accord comes with the highest fuel economy rating of any plug-in hybrid on the market, earning an estimated 115 miles per gallon equivalent (MPGe). The PHEV version of the Accord will be priced at $40,570, including destination.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"The Accord Plug-in will have a few exterior styling tweaks to aid with aerodynamics. It also has the safety and comfort features of the current Accord’s Touring trim level. Where it differs from its Accord litter mates, though, is under the hood. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Like other plug-ins, the Accord PHEV (which stands for “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle”) has an electric motor, a gasoline engine, and a rechargeable battery. When a driver starts the car up in the morning (assuming the battery has been charged), the car will operate in all-electric mode until the battery charge is depleted, at which point it will switch to gasoline-electric hybrid drive, using a mixture of engine and battery power to maximize the car’s efficiency. At high speeds, or if the driver demands quick acceleration, the car will run on the gasoline engine alone. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>Three-Hour Charge</h4>\r\nThe car’s 6.7-kilowatt-hour battery charges in three hours using a conventional 120-volt wall plug and will give drivers thirteen miles of all-electric range before calling on the car’s gasoline engine for assistance.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Thirteen miles may not seem like much when compared to the Chevrolet Volt’s thirty-eight miles of all-electric range or even the C-Max Energi’s twenty-one miles of electric and gasoline life. The Accord’s three-hour charging time, though, makes it more convenient for quick recharges – especially if you are set up to charge with a 240-volt plug, which decreases charge time to one hour. The C-Max requires seven hours to reach a full charge with a 120-volt plug, while the Volt can take more than ten hours to fully charge using a 120-volt outlet.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>Has the Range Bar Been Permanently Raised?</h4>\r\nIt remains to be seen whether 115 MPGe will become the new brass ring for plug-in hybrid vehicles. Perhaps future PHEVs will reach for an even loftier goal. The actual mileage experienced by drivers of plug-ins varies widely depending on their driving and charging habits, but considering that the most popular plug-in on the market today, the Volt, doesn’t even crack 100 MPGe, it’s safe to say that the bar has been raised. A bonus that should attract Californians is that the car will qualify for single-occupant use of commuter lanes.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h4>Accord Hybrid Coming Soon</h4>\r\nIf wall plugs and all-electric travel are a little too twenty-second century for you, or if you’re not in one of the major markets that will see the plug-in this January, take solace in the fact that the Accord Plug-In will be joined by a more conventional Accord Hybrid in summer 2013. The hybrid will also earn impressive mileage, with 49 mpg in the city and 45 mpg on the highway. Pricing on that one has not yet been announced.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Honda Accord

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

An EV is cheap to charge and run, but it won’t take you far before it needs more juice, and there’s no backup.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

(For the less dedicated, there is a separate PTI that tells you how early to leave if you only want to be late one day per week.) Washington, D.C., has the highest PTI: no surprise for those of us who have spent time on the Beltway. Washingtonians need to allow two hours and fifty-one minutes for a thirty-minute drive during peak hours. That’s almost six times more commuting, for you non-math types. Of course, if you leave three hours early for work every day, you’ll be two and a half hours early some days (the day after Christmas, perhaps) and just on time other days (the morning after a blizzard, for instance).","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":47820033,"fileName":"Morning_Commute_Chart.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47820033/Morning_Commute_Chart.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":621}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":42877196,"fileName":"Congestion_Tables_622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42877196/Congestion_Tables_622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":621}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":4,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>2. Avoid Peak Hours</h4>\r\nThe Transportation Institute suggests that drivers avoid traveling during peak traffic hours if possible.

That same trip made during “free flow” periods, when congestion has cleared out, would take just thirty-five minutes.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Sometimes you don’t have a choice about when to travel, but if your place of work has flexible hours or allows telecommuting, it might be worth it to wait until after rush hour to make the trip to work.

Check for Delays before You Leave</h4>\r\nSince no one wants to be the person who leaves hours early every single day on the off chance that there’s a logjam, it makes sense to check a local radio station or even Google Maps before you leave the house to see if there are any backups you should avoid. If there’s a particular route that is consistently clogged during rush hour, try to plan around it. And if you have one of the many cars with available traffic notifications, the cost of the subscription is worth it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h4>4. Carpool</h4>\r\nCarpooling is a win-win: if your area has HOV lanes, a carpool buddy will allow you to bypass the worst of the congestion. If your area doesn’t have HOV lanes, you’ll have a few people to split the cost of gas with, and some conversation partners in case you get stuck in gridlock.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-06T12:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Fiat Lust","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44003132/Fiat-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":44003132,"fileName":"Fiat-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-06T13:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Fiat Lust","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48771195/Fiat-header2.jpg","fileMasterId":48771195,"fileName":"Fiat-header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2339},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":4156}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-06T12:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Fiat Lust","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44003111/Fiat-flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":44003111,"fileName":"Fiat-flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":456495,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Jealousy is an ugly emotion.

In the year of the laborious proceedings of separation, many divorced women have had to make the choice between buying eggs or buying gas, and I was no different. The Cinquecento, then, had come to represent a life of economic stability for which I yearned desperately.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

It's a hybrid designed for city driving that pairs a gasoline engine with a hydraulic motor powered by compressed nitrogen. The nitrogen is stored in a tank under the car, and when the driver decelerates or brakes, that action causes it to compress. The kinetic energy stored in the compressed nitrogen can then be used to power the car for up to 80 percent of city driving, depending on the traffic. More traffic, and thus more braking, will allow the car to be powered by nitrogen, or basically to run on air, for a greater percentage of a trip. Peugeot says this technology could get the car to as much as 81 mpg in the city, where its regenerative braking capability would be most useful.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Peugeot's Hybrid Air system is experimental for now, but the company hopes to have the technology in European showrooms by 2015 or 2016.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Pay Attention</h3>\nOne of the Allstate’s first tips for sharing the road with motorcyclists is to look both ways to check for bikers. Motorcycles can hide in blind spots or blend in at intersections. Always make sure that you are fully aware of your surroundings and look for motorcycles before you change lanes or cross an intersection.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>2. No Tailgating</h3>\nThis is good advice no matter whom you’re driving behind, but since motorcycles are especially vulnerable, it counts double when you’re behind a biker. Pick a stationary object like a street sign or a tree and count the seconds between when the rider (or driver) ahead of you passes it and when your front tires go by. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recommends three or four seconds of leeway between a car and the motorcycle it’s following. Maintaining a proper following distance will give you time to react in case of an emergency. Obviously, you can—and should—adjust the three-or-four-second rule if weather or visibility is bad.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Motorcycle Safety","caption":"","fileMasterId":52311621,"fileName":"motorcycle-05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52311621/motorcycle-05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":3,"text":"<h3>3. Motorcycles May Be Closer Than They Appear</h3>\nThe Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) notes that since motorcycles are small, they can appear to be farther away than they really are. Since they’re so maneuverable, they can appear to be moving more quickly than they are. Just like the warning on your side mirrors tell you, err on the side of caution and act as if the motorcycles on the road are closer than they appear. That means no cutting across an intersection if a motorcycle is approaching","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>4. Make Eye Contact</h3>\nNHTSA and MSF also noted that motorcycles don’t have the self-canceling turn signals that car drivers take for granted, so if you see a motorcycle with its turn signal blinking, keep in mind that the rider may have just forgotten to turn the signal off after a previous turn. Make eye contact with motorcyclists before you turn toward them at intersections, just to be sure you’re both aware.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>5. Do What You (Should) Always Do</h3>\nThis should go without saying, but be courteous when sharing the road with motorcyclists (and bicyclists and other cars). Bikers have much less room for error than the drivers of enclosed automobiles, so give them a break. Don’t drive aggressively when you’re sharing their road space or cut them off. Use your turn signals and don’t make sudden lane changes or turns. Basically, drive the way you should be driving anyway.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":9},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/features/car-safety/motorcycle-safety--a-rite-of-spring/index.html","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:13:57.015-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546437016 }} },{ "_id":342063,"title":"Subaru's Latest Gear for a Cause","subTitle":"AWD specialist dares to go beyond fleece","slug":"subaru-s-latest-gear-for-a-cause","promoTitle":"Subaru's Latest Gear for a Cause","promoTeaserSmall":"Designed by a <em>Project Runway</em> champion, the salt-and-pepper shirt benefits HIV/AIDS causes.","promoTeaser":"Designed by a <em>Project Runway</em> champion, the salt-and-pepper shirt benefits HIV/AIDS causes.","keywords":["Gear for a Cause"],"metaTitle":"Subaru's Latest Gear for a Cause - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Subaru's Latest Gear for a Cause","Subaru gear","Subaru dog-friendly products","Subaru T-Shirts"],"metaDescription":"Subaru's Latest Gear for a Cause includes T-shirts that help you contribute to charities and dog-friendly products with a Subaru twist.

I really don't. The freedom of getting behind the wheel of a car and just taking off can't be compared with anything else. You really feel that you’re in charge: in charge of the car, in charge of the road, and in charge of your life. Why on earth would you want someone else to drive you around when you could do it yourself? It’s so liberating! Obviously, I love driving. I suppose that isn't a particularly original statement for a Detroit native, but it's true. I was a little late getting my driver's license because of that pesky parallel parking, but once I got it, nothing could stop me. It doesn't matter if I have to chauffeur my grandmother to the bank less than a block from our house or drive across town. If I have my green Chrysler LHS--affectionately christened \"Betsy\" by my mother--and some gas in the tank, and if I am somehow able to avoid getting pulled over for driving just a little too fast, I'm good to go.\n\nSince I graduated from the University of Michigan, in April 2012, Betsy has taken me everywhere. She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn’t as dry as a piece of chalk…And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there. Not only am I a bibliophile, but I’m also a self-proclaimed Anglophile who loves Shakespeare and Elizabethan verse and one day plans to see the Houses of Parliament, visit the Tower of London, and, perhaps most important, eat real fish and chips.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-25T12:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"bmw-orange-crush","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52427772/m3-orange-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":52427772,"fileName":"m3-orange-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-25T12:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"bmw-orange-crush","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46105222/m3-orange-header.jpg","fileMasterId":46105222,"fileName":"m3-orange-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-26T05:53:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013-bmw-m3-my-orange-crush","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46170646/m3-orange-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":46170646,"fileName":"m3-orange-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":463140,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Being the sister website to <em>Automobile Magazine</em> allows us front-row seats to a rotating selection of the latest vehicles.

Seizinger shared the attention to detail that went into the paint scheme. \"The stripes on the car were hand painted by a local pinstripe artist here [in California]. The colors are traditional BMW M-series colors and were hand applied using different brushes and techniques. We wanted each stripe to have an individual character and feel to it, much like we wanted our car to have. We wanted to evoke the passion of something created by hand in the same way a painting is painted or a sculpture is sculpted. Not temporary and cheap like [a] vinyl sticker. It also pays homage to the way racing stripes were hand applied with brushes in the early days of racing and speed records.” In a nutshell, the car looks like it should be parked in your living room to show what great taste you have in art.

After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T17:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44264151/driving-moccasins+pl+prada-driver-moccasins.jpg","fileMasterId":44264151,"fileName":"driving-moccasins+pl+prada-driver-moccasins.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":366},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T17:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41123470/driving-moccasins+header+prada-driver-moccasins.jpg","fileMasterId":41123470,"fileName":"driving-moccasins+header+prada-driver-moccasins.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":366},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T17:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41123473/driving-moccasins+hp+tods-special-moccasins.jpg","fileMasterId":41123473,"fileName":"driving-moccasins+hp+tods-special-moccasins.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":239057,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Just because you shouldn't drive in your stilettos doesn't mean you have to go barefoot.

As anyone from a very large family can likely attest, it’s challenging for each member to stand out. Such is the case with the poor Matrix, essentially a tall Corolla wagon styled like a crossover. Splitting the difference between the bargain-basement Yaris and the big-boned, Camry-based Venza in body style and price point, the Matrix is ideally packaged for the  young family and the empty nester. But evidence of willful neglect on the part of the parent company shows up in the general lack of updates Toyota has given the Matrix since its last redesign four years ago. The 2013 changes are mostly limited to audio systems with Bluetooth and USB connectivity (at last!), and a touchscreen interface for the upgrade system. All-wheel drive remains available, as do two four-cylinder engine choices: a 132-horsepower 1.8-liter and a 158-horsepower 2.4-liter—but, thanks in part to subpar transmissions, the Matrix remains less than competitive in fuel economy. Factor in a conspicuously cheap interior and lack of overall pizzazz, and it’s easy to understand why the Matrix has a tough time standing out.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 4","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The ride quality in the FX line may be a bit too harsh for commuters and the school carpool as well. Still, performance is top notch with the base FX37 model getting a new standard 325-horsepower 3.7-liter V-6 engine. Rear-wheel drive is standard on the base model and all-wheel drive is optional. The top-of-the-line FX50 with all-wheel drive gets a beefy 390-horsepower 5.0-liter V-8 engine. Both engines are linked to a standard seven-speed automatic transmission. Both models have double-wishbone front and multilink rear suspensions and large four-wheel disc brakes. The cabin is richly appointed and there are lots of extras like optional sport seats that hold the passengers in place during hard cornering and make the driver feel like she’s Danica Patrick. Solid magnesium paddle shifters are optional and enhance the FX’s performance-oriented personality. The FX line may not be the best choice for hauling your kids and pets, but it does have one unusual accessory that would be perfect for sleepovers: a “hatch tent” that converts the cargo area into a sleeping area.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

But big changes are on tap for the new model year as the 2013 LR2 gets a smaller engine with an eye toward improved fuel economy. The baby Land Rover gets a new 240-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine replacing the previous 3.2-liter inline six-cylinder engine. The new engine is borrowed from the 2012 Range Rover Evoque and is 88 pounds lighter than the outgoing inline six-cylinder engine it replaces. The engine is linked to a six-speed automatic transmission. The EPA has yet to provide the most critical information about the redesign – namely, the fuel economy, but the numbers are expected to be significantly better. In the meantime, buyers should be prepared to shell out more for the 2013 model, since the base crossover gets a $700 price increase. The 2013 Land Rover LR2 starts at $37,250, which is still cheaper than the BMW X3, one of its chief rivals. The LR2 gets a mini- makeover said to give it a sportier look. The LR2’s cabin also borrows items from the Evoque, including a new center console. Off-roaders will appreciate the fact that, despite the overhaul, the LR2 retains the same 8.3-inch minimum of ground clearance to play hard on rocky, sandy, rutted, or muddy terrain.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Like Kate Middleton, who can throw an inexpensive sweater over a designer gown and look great, the Range Rover Sport, with its understated British elegance, provides an ideal blend of performance, style, capability, and value. It slots in between the Range Rover Evoque and the full-size Range Rover and gets lots of kudos for its modern interior, great acceleration, and handling, along with its excellent driving position that provides a commanding view of the road. You may need access to the Queen’s treasury, though, when it comes to the gas pump. At its worst, the 2013 Range Rover Sport returns just 12 mpg in city driving and 17 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The Range Rover Sport is equipped with either a 375-horsepower 5.0-liter V-8 engine or a supercharged 510-horsepower V-8 engine linked to a six-speed automatic transmission. It features standard full-time all-wheel drive and a Terrain Response system. Some buyers may object to the firm ride, but the Range Rover Sport should be on your shopping list if you need something to take you from the trail to the country club with ease. However, it’s not cheap, ranging in price from around $60,000 to $86,000.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br/>\n1.

The Japanese automaker has carried over the 270-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 engine in the Altima, but has revised the 2.5-liter four-cylinder, increasing output from 175 to 182 horsepower. A redesigned Xtronic continuously variable transmission boosts fuel economy in both engines – to 27 mpg in city driving and 38 mpg on the highway on the four-cylinder, according to the EPA. The Altima’s cabin gets dolled up with a new articulated seat design, available in cloth or leather, as well as a new advanced Drive-Assist Display. The Altima offers good handling and a compliant ride. Nissan expanded the Altima range with seven trim levels for 2013.The four-cylinder models get either sixteen-inch steel wheels or seventeen-inch alloy rims, while the six-cylinder models come with eighteen-inch alloys. Available safety technologies are plentiful and include blind spot warning, lane departure warning, and moving object detection.

The hybrid will increase the Q5’s already strong gas mileage (20 mpg in the city, 28 mpg on the highway) and add yet more options to the versatile crossovers. Last year’s unsatisfactory V-6 engine will be replaced by a supercharged 272-horsepower option. Buyers can also stick with the previously successful four-cylinder engine.  The Q5 also makes use of Audi’s famous quattro all-wheel drive. A quintessential crossover, the Q5’s exterior avoids the boring trappings of a sedan without looking like a hulking SUV. This design has proved effective in the past, with the Q5 boasting Audi’s second-best sales. In addition to changes to engines, the Q5 has had some improvements to the interior. New aluminum trim options make the inside more attractive, while available Audi Connect technology means the Q5 can access the Internet and connect with Google Maps. Audio controls have also been integrated into the steering wheel for greater convenience.  The new Q5 will also sport Audi’s aggressive and unmistakable new grille and headlight design.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

The speed of the Spur in particular defies all logic – it’s a big car with excellent performance statistics. The Mulsanne may have edged it out on the flagship’s prestige category, but the Flying Spur is more than a dignified contender. Lambswool, leather and wood are Bentley calling cards found in the interior. The Flying Spur is twice the price as Mercedes-Benz S Class, but is also twice as refined in more subtle ways. A big engine, all-wheel drive and the extra brawn have their drawbacks at the pump — it gets 10 mpg city and 17 mpg highway. But if you’re Bentley bound, the gas bill probably isn’t your preeminent concern. Bentley has also improved its technology and now features top-of-the line entertainment and navigation.

You get the same menu of engines and transmissions as in the 3-series, but the 1’s overall lighter weight makes for exhilarating performance. The trade-off is that the only models available are the coupe and convertible. Life with a two-door compact can be a struggle, as when you’re hurrying to expel passengers at the airport. (By then, they’ll be overjoyed to get out of the cramped back seat.) But if rear passengers would be a rarity and driving thrills are your pursuit, the 1-series offers its own rewards. The 128i comes with a 3.0-liter 230-horsepower six-cylinder and the choice of a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. The turbocharged 135i slightly revises the six to blast off with 300 horsepower; that six-speed manual is standard, but an enthusiastic driver might prefer the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic’s legerdemain.

Moderately restyled for 2013, the Enclave is offered in both front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive versions, and in Convenience, Leather, and Premium trim levels. All have a V-6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission that yield 24 mpg on the highway for the front-wheel-drive model. The four-wheel-drive model does slightly less, with 22 mpg on the highway. The three rows really do accommodate three rows of full-size passengers, but in consequence, there’s less luggage space in the back than might be desired, at a maximum of 23.3 cubic feet if you leave all rows of seats in place. Safety features include a front center side air bag, which Buick notes is an industry first, and a standard rear-vision camera. A power liftgate and remote start are both standard. Luxury add-ons abound, including a premium audio system, color-touch radio with DVD and navigation plus a seven-inch touchscreen, an eight-way passenger’s seat adjuster, and choccochino and cocoa leather color combinations for the interior.  The chrome accents are real, the stitching on the door trim and interior is real, and so is Buick’s commitment to the upscale family buyer.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><del></del><br />\n1.

The IPL G Convertible starts at $61,495, including an $895 destination charge, making it $8,600 more expensive than the base 2013 Infiniti G37 convertible. The IPL G Convertible is equipped with a 343-horsepower 3.7-liter V-6, seven-speed automatic transmission, IPL-tuned exhaust and suspension, nineteen-inch special wheels, and a three-piece retractable hardtop. Surprisingly, the exterior color choices on the new convertible are limited to just two: Malbec Black or Moonlight White. The droptop can be dolled up with extras like the $360 Midnight Black grille and $340 illuminated kick plates. A $545 rear wind deflector is a practical option, especially if you’re worried about your hair. Standard features include leather-trimmed seating and antilock brakes. The IPL G Coupe comes in two models, one with a seven-speed automatic transmission and another with a six-speed manual transmission. The IPL G Coupe gets a different look than its G sibling thanks to a different front and rear bumper design, sculpted side sills, a rear spoiler, and fancy nineteen-inch wheels. The pricing on the 2013 IPL G Convertible is designed to fall in between some of its toughest German competition.

The Santa Fe went on a major diet and shed 266 pounds versus the outgoing model. The result is a big improvement in fuel economy, with the base Sport model returning 33 mpg on the highway. Two engine choices are available in the Sport model: a 190 horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder GDI engine and a 264-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder GDI engine.

The 2013 Santa Fe has a more sculpted look and standard chrome exterior touches. Families will appreciate the flexible seating arrangements and the attention to safety features, including seven standard air bags. There are lots more extras, too, including such options as a panoramic sunroof, push-button start, heated steering wheel, and a second-row seat that slides. The Santa Fe used to be priced more attractively than the competition, but that may no longer be the case.

The base Sonata also gets a $1,100 price increase over the outgoing base model. The uplevel Sonata Limited gets a 274-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged GDI four-cylinder engine and six-speed automatic transmission. The 2013 Sonata with the 2.4-liter inline four-cylinder engine gets a respectable 35 mpg highway rating, according to the EPA. The Sonata can be transformed from a family hauler to a near-luxury car with the addition of such options as a $2,900 Limited Premium package that includes a panoramic sunroof, navigation system, rear back-up camera, and Infinity premium speakers and stereo components. The 2013 Sonata comes standard with three months of XM Satellite Radio. Every 2013 Sonata has electronic stability control as standard equipment.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The hybrid version is fast and frugal, returning 27 mpg in city and 32 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. A seven-speed automatic transmission is standard on all models. All-wheel drive is available.

The Cadillac Escalade EXT is fancy yet reasonably practical, with seating for five thanks to a rear bench seat. You wouldn’t get the Escalade EXT for serious ongoing hauling needs, since its truck bed is only five feet long, but it comes with GM’s clever Midgate system, also used on the Chevrolet Avalanche. The Midgate lets you fold the rear seats down and extend the pickup bed inside the cabin, giving you a much more useful eight-foot bed. You can also unlatch the rear window and store it inside a recess in the Midgate panel for open-air driving enjoyment. Features and goodies are extensive and include Bose audio, leather-trimmed heated and cooled front seats, and dual-zone climate control. There’s also a standard lockable tonneau cover—although you can take it off to increase storage versatility. Since this is, after all, a sport-utility vehicle turned into a pickup, it shares the same V-8 engine and six-speed automatic transmission as the other Escalades. The Escalade’s all-wheel drive and 7,600-pound towing capacity mean it’s more than just a good-looking luxury vehicle—it’s one you can actually get some utility from.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors: </strong><br />\n1.

Why? Because it is straight up hedonistic, with a gorgeously luxuriant interior and a smooth ride in the best large-sedan manner. The feeling starts with Cadillac’s new Cue information and entertainment system, making its debut on the 2013 XTS. Its eight-inch touchscreen incorporates the capacitive touch of an iPhone for a satisfyingly intuitive user experience.  It continues with the Bose audio, leather trim choices all the way up to a buttery full leather interior depending on model, subtle accent lighting, and real wood trim. The XTS is a front-wheel drive car, in contrast to the ATS, and all-wheel drive is available. Its safety systems are as thoroughly indulgent as its luxury equipment. For example, there’s an optional Driver Assistance active safety package that incorporates active short-range radar and a smart camera above the inside mirror that shoots twelve high-definition photos per minute, all in the service of spotting and avoiding hazards. Performance purists may dislike the fact that the XTS has front-wheel drive, but this is probably not the product they’re looking for anyway.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter: </strong>7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors: </strong><br />\n1.

Buyers can opt for the 138-horsepower 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine or a 164-horsepower four-cylinder engine linked to either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. While it returns decent fuel economy, the Soul falls just short of the 40-mpg Holy Grail. The 1.6-liter model with a six-speed automatic transmission returns 27 mpg in city driving and 35 mpg on the highway. A Soul Eco model with Intelligent Stop and Go technology and an Active Eco system wrings out a bit more fuel economy, returning 29 mpg city and 36 mpg highway. The Eco package is available with either engine. There’s no denying the fun quotient with Soul, even for thrifty-minded buyers. An optional sound system has backlit speakers that can flash in time with the music.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Sportage got a major redesign two years ago and receives only modest upgrades for the new model year. They include standard power folding outside mirrors, a new blue interior package for the EX model with dark blue cloth seats and a black headliner, standard LED accent lights for the LX and EX models, and a standard sun visor extender on all models. The base Sportage gets a 176-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. A standard 260-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline direct injection four-cylinder engine revs up the Sportage SX. While the base Sportage returns 22 mpg in city driving and 32 mpg on the highway, performance enthusiasts won’t pay too great a penalty if they opt for the turbo engine. The EPA says it returns 22 mpg in city driving and 29 mpg on the highway.

It is rated at 47 mpg both in town and on the highway—which Ford hastens to point out is 7 mpg better than the Toyota Prius v’s highway numbers. The C-Max has a lithium-ion battery that recharges when the gasoline engine is in use; plus, there’s regenerative braking—recycling at its least onerous—which recaptures up to 95 percent of the energy used in braking and uses it to recharge the battery. The C-Max is not only efficient; it also responds to the eco-conscious aesthetic by using a greenery theme in its Smartgauge display, which displays more leaves and vines as a “visual reward” when a driver is more efficient in his or her driving habits. The C-Max’s popular price, starting just over $25,000—lower than its closest rival, the Toyota Prius, and some $10,000 cheaper than the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf—will help it win fans, as will its uncontroversial styling. The fact that you can drive the plug-in Energi at speeds up to 85 mph on electrical power alone should electrify the highway commuter crowd.

With a vigorous stance and large wheels and tires, it gains a distinctly new appearance. It also gains a high-tech center console and optional eighteen-way power seats. It loses weight while gaining efficiency, and coupe models gain a sliding glass sunroof. So far, you’ve only counted positives, right? Well, consider that the new, electrically-assisted power steering wins few praises, and the longer wheelbase contributes to a slightly less immediate driving experience. Now the 911 Carrera 4 and 4S all-wheel-drive models, each available as coupe or convertible, have joined the lineup with the rear-drive Carrera (350-horsepower 3.4-liter flat six-cylinder) and Carrera S. With the S, they share the same 400-horsepower 3.8-liter flat six and seven-speed manual or optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, but the all-wheel drive cars are about two inches wider in back to accommodate different hardware and slightly fatter tires. The 4 and 4S introduce active cruise control and crash avoidance systems. If you need something with a top speed as high as 196 mph, the 500-horsepower 911 Turbo and 530-horsepower 911 Turbo S coupe and convertible, based on the previous-generation car, remain on sale.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 10","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

They didn’t mess it up! While looking similar to its precursor, it benefits from a subtle redefinition that makes the bodywork even more handsome and the shape more evocative. (And it looks less like the Porsche 911 than before.) An array of striking exterior colors and bold, or even shocking, interior upholstery combinations can be summoned as a way of making your Boxster extra special. There are even three different steering wheels among your choices. The Boxster now has a 265-horsepower 2.7-liter flat six-cylinder while the Boxster S has a 315-horsepower 3.4-liter flat six. A six-speed manual gearbox is standard with the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic optional. The latter transmission is faster actin’ than Tinactin. As a fuel-saving ploy, the new “coasting” mode decouples the engine from the wheels when the car is coasting, thereby reducing friction. But when the driver is in a fractious frame of mind and seeks unruliness, the available Sport Chrono feature manages all onboard systems and helps the car achieve its highest performance. So equipped, the S will sprint from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.7 seconds.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 10","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Crosstour shares much of what’s inside with the Accord, including the engine and suspension. It also makes use of variable cylinder management, which allows the car to adjust its power to the demands of the driver and increases fuel economy. The 2013 model will come with Honda’s new safety equipment, including blind spot cameras, lane departure warning, and front collision warning. The Crosstour distinguishes itself from Honda’s other mid-size cars not only in its styling, but with its much greater capacity. With 25.7 cubic feet of cargo space, it has just about twice as much space as the Accord or Civic. Despite being one of only four Honda models not rated above 30 mpg on the highway, it still gets a relatively strong 25 to 27 mpg highway and 17 to 18 mpg in the city, enough to incite gas-pump envy from plenty of drivers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

The base 2013 Accent gets a $2,000 price increase over the outgoing base 2012 Accent GLS ­ but Hyundai has beefed up the standard equipment list considerably. Standard features now include air-conditioning, remote keyless entry, an audio system with six speakers, heated side mirrors, body-colored door handles, and a sunglasses holder. The Accent even gets a new, optional power sunroof on the SE model. But shoppers should be aware that the base Accent is now more expensive than several of its key competitors, including the base 2013 Ford Fiesta S sedan. The Accent is a mighty performer and won’t disappoint at the pump. It is equipped with a 138-horsepower 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine linked to either an optional six-speed automatic transmission or standard six-speed manual transmission. The EPA says that either powertrain configuration will return 30 mpg in city driving and 40 mpg on the highway. Much of Accent’s competition does not hit that magic 40 mpg mark. Six air bags are standard on the Accent and there’s no skimping on styling, thanks to Accent’s newer sculptured look. Five-door Accent SE models get a sporty roof-mounted spoiler and vertical taillights, dressing up the subcompact even more.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Volkswagen almost makes up for this with the large cargo area and a rear seat that splits three ways for convenient folding, but the fact is that if you absolutely need a seven-seater, the Touareg won’t do the trick. The Touareg is far and away Volkswagen’s most expensive car, with a price range topping $60,000. The car is also far and away Volkswagen’s most luxurious offering, with walnut wood accents, available leather seats, and various available sound systems that will blast your eardrums into submission. The fuel economy is decent for a car this size, especially if you choose the diesel engine or the V-6 hybrid. If you’re more concerned with brand cachet than quality or functionality, you should spring for an Audi or a BMW.

The Grand Cherokee is more than capable off-road with various drive and suspension settings to fit the demands of the trail. Better yet, the Grand Cherokee has retained its ability to drive the back roads without skimping on the interior. With four different trim levels and the SRT8 model, interior choices range from just plain comfortable to quite luxurious, with the top of the line Grand Cherokee boasting leather bucket seats and wood accents throughout the cabin. An optional navigation system includes voice recognition and Sirius Real Time Traffic information so you can skirt the crowds on your way out of town. If this Jeep sounds too good to be true, the fuel economy should sober you up. The Grand Cherokee barely tops 20 miles to the gallon on the highway, and claims the lowest mileage of Jeep’s fleet quite easily.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

New seats offer more support for long drives and a new soft top is easier for one person to put on and take off.

Standard removable doors will please thrill seekers, and an optional navigation system with DVD/CD player and MP3 capability will please the more comfort-minded. The six available trim levels mean that there are plenty of options, but even the priciest Wrangler still comes in under $40,000.

The less expensive of the two Lambos on the market, it comes around $200,000, roughly the price of a starter home in a nice neighborhood. Slower and far subtler than the Lamborghini Aventador, it still tops out just above 200 mph and has unmistakable supercar looks. In a machine like this, everything comes second to power. The Gallardo doesn’t disappoint, offering a choice of a 550-, 560-, or 570-horsepower engine. The 570-horse version takes the Gallardo from 0 to 62 mph in less than four seconds and 0 to 124 mph in about 10 seconds. Some models are available with all-wheel drive to help keep control of the car at high speeds. The Gallardo seats two, and is available as a convertible with a soft top. Compared to its stunning performance, the interior is rarely the selling point on a Lamborghini, but that doesn’t mean it falls short. With leather seats, available two-tone or monotone, available accents like a suede steering wheel, and an available navigation system (albeit, a very expensive one), you will be plenty comfortable while zooming past plebs in their sedans.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 10","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

The larger, 6.0-liter one affords you the opportunity to play with 621 horsepower. Five- or seven-speed automatic transmissions are offered. If you’re planning on snowy winters, you should keep in mind that the CL550 is the only all-wheel-drive model. The exterior design is highlighted by pillarless construction that leaves an undefiled sweep of side glass. Body colors are subdued and dignified. Besides being exquisitely beautiful inside, the car is loaded with amenities. Heated and ventilated front seats offer a massaging capability, for example. Every conceivable active safety system is available, helping the driver to stay awake, see their blind spots, distinguish pedestrians at night, and keep the car in its lane.

The Smart ForTwo is great for what it was designed for – short trips in big cities where parking and gas are too expensive to warrant a full-sized vehicle. It does a fantastic job of parking in tight spaces, and can park with its nose to the curb where a normal car would have to parallel park. The gas mileage is good – 34 mpg in the city, 38 mpg on the highway – but not a huge jump over some fuel-efficient or hybrid sedans. The Smart makes up for this by being much cheaper than most hybrids, starting just above $13,000. The very small package assumes certain sacrifices, and the long-legged among us might feel claustrophobic in the Smart’s tiny interior. Luckily, a convertible model is available for those who like to feel the breeze in their hair or need extra headroom. Smart made the wise choice of keeping the interior sparse and not cluttering the already tight space. With a top speed under 70 mph, the Smart won’t get your blood pumping, but it is a good option for city dwellers, and fits well with an environment-friendly lifestyle.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

This is not to suggest that the tC is in any way boring. It is quick to accelerate and comes in a limited-run RS model (available only in “Absolutely Red’) that features a racy body kit and some Toyota Racing Development enhancements.  A six-speed transmission adds fuel efficiency, helping the tC inch its way above 30 miles to the gallon on the highway. The tC’s fabric seats are less than attractive, but the rest of the interior is pleasing, and the power moonroof is a nice touch. New for this model are standard Bluetooth and a Pioneer audio system. As with all Scions, the base package is just the beginning, with available after-market upgrades ranging from high performance air filters to illuminated doorsills.

The leather-lined cabin is the last word in comfort and luxury, and with the aggressive, distinctive grille, your status as the owner of a Rolls will be broadcast to everyone you see. If you prefer your luxury a little more personalized, Rolls-Royce has a bespoke department to meet those needs. More than half of Ghosts sold in 2011 had bespoke elements. The Ghost comes with coach doors (suicide doors to the déclassé), for maximum exiting ease to chauffeured passengers. Because despite the Ghost’s impressive performance (0 to 60 mph in less than five seconds) this car may be one of the few that is best enjoyed from the back seat.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

That good news continues with the Ram’s new grille and fascia, a more powerful V-6 engine, and an eight-speed automatic transmission—which has an interesting e-shift dial instead of floor or column shifters. There’s a nod to aerodynamics with grille shutters and an air suspension that has five height settings, including two for off-road applications. The Ram 1500 also has a fuel-saving stop-start system that shuts the engine off when the truck comes to a stop, then restarts it automatically. Add to that a set of low-rolling-resistance tires, another way to improve fuel economy, and you can see how the Ram came up with class-leading mpg. A V-8 engine is still on offer, too, for those so inclined. Inside, the half-ton Ram gets the latest UConnect Access telematics with an 8.4-inch touchscreen; it has a wireless connection built in, which lets you open and start the truck remotely using Internet or smartphone and use voice commands for phone, text, navigation, and music, not to mention hook up to a variety of online services. There’s HD radio as well, a first for the Ram. All that, and a price only one percent higher than the outgoing model at $23,585 including destination for the base model.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tChevrolet Silverado 1500<br />\n2.\tFord F-150<br />\n3.\tNissan Titan<br />\n4.\tToyota Tundra","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items: </strong><br />\n1.\tAir suspension<br />\n2.\tRotary e-shift dial on eight-speed transmission","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks </strong><br />\n1.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

But Versa was the Holy Grail when it came to inexpensive cars last year after Hyundai walked away from the fight over such a title with its redesigned Accent. The base 2012 Versa sedan with a five-speed manual transmission starts at a remarkable $11,770, including a $780 destination charge. Nissan redesigned the Versa sedan for 2012 and it still has appeal for those shopping for the best value. The Versa also comes in a hatchback version, which has yet to undergo a major revision and is a carryover from the 2012 model year. The Versa sedan has much to recommend it since highway fuel economy increases to 40 mpg this year on CVT-equipped models. The sedan is equipped with a 109-horsepower 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. A Versa sedan with a four-speed automatic transmission is new for 2013. Different trim levels on the sedan also add new features for 2013, including the addition of a rear spoiler on CVT-equipped models and goodies like a remote key fob trunk release on SL models.  In addition to excellent value, the sedan also has a huge trunk and plenty of ride comfort. On the downside, acceleration is acceptable, but not thrilling. If you’re into extreme couponing, stockpiling toilet paper, and penny pinching, the Versa should be on your shopping list.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

GMC’s Yukon and its long-wheelbase Yukon XL are getting a little long in the tooth, but they still have few peers in the art of shuttling people, hauling things, or towing trailers—or doing all three simultaneously—with space and style. On the Yukon’s long list of goodies are cool, fold-and-tumble second-row seats with one-handed operation, as well as OnStar and standard third-row seating. A Heritage edition is offered in blue, black, or white, and features twenty-inch wheels, exterior and interior commemorative badging, content upgrades and more, while the Denali model turns the Yukon into a poor man’s Cadillac Escalade. Well, not too poor of a man, as the bling-u-vee model’s signature perforated chrome grille, huge twenty- or twenty-two-inch wheels, upgraded interior materials, Nuance leather upholstery, surround sound audio system, power-release second-row tumbling seats, remote start, rear camera and park assist certainly don’t come for free. But they do add some serious pizzazz to GM’s hardy mega-ute, whether they be standard, XL, or hybrid varieties. Yes, we said “hybrid.” GM builds a hybrid version of this beast, which makes little sense for country folks, but with a third better city fuel economy, urban-dwelling Yukon intenders may want to snatch one up soon as they’re rumored to be on the chopping block when the next-gen model arrives, likely next year.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

It’s still a full-size SUV, even if it’s not the fullest-size you can get from the bowtie brand. It can tow up to 8,500 pounds, carry cargo up to 108.9 cubic feet, and still get 21 mpg on the highway. That latter figure is courtesy of Active Fuel Management on the 5.3-liter V-8 and a standard six-speed transmission. Then there’s the two-mode hybrid, which delivers 20 mpg in town and 23 mpg on the highway in either rear- or four-wheel-drive versions, which GM says is tops for the full-size utility segment.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Mechanically, there are three engine choices: a four-cylinder EcoBoost, a 3.7-liter V-6, and a hybrid version that uses the four-cylinder and gives this sedan a 41-mpg highway rating. Lincoln Drive Control is standard. As for safety features, the MKZ gets a lane-keeping suite that includes a rearview-mirror-mounted camera to read lane markers up ahead, and there’s adaptive cruise control, blind spot alert, and a collision warning system that puts on the brakes for you if you’re about to hit something. For the back-seat passengers--and you can invite them along without guilt thanks to the interior spaciousness--there are inflatable rear seatbelts on top of the eight airbags this car already has as standard; those inflatable belts are a class exclusive, Lincoln points out. All-wheel drive is an option, and active park assist is the icing on this already very well-accessorized cake.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong>:<br/>\n1.

I turned my first wrench when I was about four, growing up among my dad's collection of weird old British and American classics. In adolescence, I was rifling through back issues of <em>Hot Rod</em> and <em>Car Craft, </em>clipping out photos and articles on fire-breathing hot rods. And after adopting my mom's old Ford Escort, I started getting part-time jobs in garages, which sustained me all the way through college and grad school. I completed the restoration of my first car on student loans, and I currently own a total of four vintage vehicles, all of which I work on. Even after earning two academic degrees and toiling most of the way through a third, my heart remained in the garage, and just as my doctoral funding ran out, I got a break on a dream job that would allow me to combine my two major life passions: writing and cars.

But make no mistake, the dainty, Jeep-like runabouts that helped get Toyota on its feet in America forty-fvive years ago are nothing at all like their 2013 namesake. Whereas the original Land Cruiser was light, simple, and lived to go topless, the new Land Cruiser is a serious and scholarly fixed-roof, seven-seater, cruising the land, so to speak, laden with more technology than all but the most expensive luxury automobiles in the world. As such, the Land Cruiser reigns supreme within Toyota’s six-member SUV hierarchy, above the Sequoia, 4Runner, Highlander, FJ Cruiser, and RAV4. And it doesn’t look to be ready to surrender its throne any time soon, with 2013 bringing an updated grille, new headlamps, and LED accent lights to convey an even more upscale appearance. It also contains even more luxury inside—all standard, by the way—in the form of ventilated perforated leather-covered front seats, a heated steering wheel, voice-activated navigation, Toyota’s EnTune app suite, and new gauges with a super-cool multi-terrain monitor. Mechanical upgrades for 2013 include a retuned suspension, radar-based cruise control, trailer-sway control, and pre-collision safety system. What hasn’t changed? The 381-horsepower V-8 is as grunty (and thirsty) as ever, and thanks to new multi-terrain engine and braking management systems, it is still one of the most capable off-roaders in the world.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong>:<br/>\n1.
