The second is creating and implementing standards for every level of automated vehicle, with testing solutions.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

And when the doodoo hits the fan, as it always does, can he keep the Way Forward plan going forward?","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:27:20.919-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547240921 }} },{ "_id":506685,"title":"Miata's Proud Parents","subTitle":"A chat with the fathers of the Mazda Miata.","slug":"miatas-proud-parents","promoTitle":"Miata's Proud Parents","promoTeaserSmall":"A chat with the fathers of the Mazda Miata.","promoTeaser":"A chat with the fathers of the Mazda Miata.","keywords":["Miata's Proud Parents"],"metaTitle":"Miata's Proud Parents - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Mazda MX-5 Miata","1989 Mazda MX-5 Miata","Mazda Miata","Mazda","Tom Matano","Bob Hall","Derek Jenkins","New York Auto Show","2014 Mazda Miata 25th Anniversary Edition","future Mazda Miatas"],"metaDescription":"The Fathers of the Mazda MX-5 Miata: Interviews with three men who are integral to the car's history.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Fast Women","id":1034957,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/fast-women","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Teenagers","id":1034773,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car/teenagers","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Kids in the Car","id":1034769,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-20T13:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"landspeed-homepage","title":"land speed record","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67363598/landspeed-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67363598,"fileName":"landspeed-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-20T13:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"landspeed-homepage","title":"land speed record","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67363598/landspeed-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67363598,"fileName":"landspeed-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-20T13:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"landspeed-header","title":"land speed record","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74148582/landspeed-header.jpg","fileMasterId":74148582,"fileName":"landspeed-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-20T13:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"landspeed-homepage","title":"land speed record","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67363598/landspeed-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67363598,"fileName":"landspeed-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":672651,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>When she was four years old, Kaylin Stewart watched her father, Tom, set a land speed record</strong> at the Bonneville Salt Flats, in Utah, and resolved to race on the salt as well.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"A few weeks from now, upon celebrating her sixteenth birthday, Kaylin will begin her quest to become the youngest driver ever to join the <a href=\"http://www.bonneville200mph.org\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">200 MPH Club</a>.

Some of the top drivers have guaranteed salaries, while others get percentages.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T06:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cadillac-ats-v-homepage","title":"Cadillac Ats V Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87772609/cadillac-ats-v-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":87772609,"fileName":"cadillac-ats-v-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T06:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cadillac-ats-v-homepage","title":"Cadillac Ats V Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87772609/cadillac-ats-v-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":87772609,"fileName":"cadillac-ats-v-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T06:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cadillac-ats-v-header","title":"Cadillac Ats V Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/84485184/cadillac-ats-v-header.jpg","fileMasterId":84485184,"fileName":"cadillac-ats-v-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T06:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cadillac-ats-v-homepage","title":"Cadillac Ats V Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87772609/cadillac-ats-v-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":87772609,"fileName":"cadillac-ats-v-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":876565,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The Cadillac ATS is sweet to look at, to sit in, and to drive.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-19T14:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mercedes-maybach-homepage","title":"Mercedes Maybach Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/79009955/mercedes-maybach-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":79009955,"fileName":"mercedes-maybach-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-19T14:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mercedes-maybach-homepage","title":"Mercedes Maybach Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/79009955/mercedes-maybach-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":79009955,"fileName":"mercedes-maybach-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-19T14:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mercedes-maybach-header","title":"Mercedes Maybach Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87646087/mercedes-maybach-header.jpg","fileMasterId":87646087,"fileName":"mercedes-maybach-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-19T14:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mercedes-maybach-homepage","title":"Mercedes Maybach Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/79009955/mercedes-maybach-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":79009955,"fileName":"mercedes-maybach-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":876713,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Seek huge and pillowy, and you’re usually led to the back of the home goods store, just beyond oversized bedding.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Nourished by direct fuel injection, it’s more efficient than the 2.0-liter four it replaces, with a slight edge in torque (148 pound-feet versus 140), and should achieve better EPA fuel economy projections (the 2.0 is rated 22 mpg city/28 highway).

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

If it was a little bouncy on Michigan's bad roads, it was certainly no worse than many crossovers or SUVs. Jean thinks the F-150 is over-the-top macho, but I think it's just macho enough to give the person driving it a sense of capability. It doesn't feel show-offy to me, but it does encourage thoughts of spring projects involving big sacks of things that would go in the back.

In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Eventually my racing aspirations gave way to a long held interest in filmmaking and I got my B.A. from the University of Michigan's burgeoning film program.

The detailed and refined Q7 interior is the perfect habitat for infotainment features like navigation and parking, lane keeping, and trailer assist features.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nTwo new exterior styling packages are available for 2015: Offroad Style Plus and Sport Style Plus.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Audi Q7 interior","fileMasterId":103975421,"fileName":"audi-Q7-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103975421/audi-Q7-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Audi Q7","fileMasterId":103975409,"fileName":"audi-Q7-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103975409/audi-Q7-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Audi Q7","fileMasterId":103975406,"fileName":"audi-Q7-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103975406/audi-Q7-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":44924,"make":"Audi","model":"Q7","year":2015},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:28:53.824-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547333825 }} },{ "_id":673493,"title":"2015 Buick Encore","subTitle":"Emoticon on wheels.","slug":"2015-buick-encore","promoTitle":"2015 Buick Encore","promoTeaserSmall":"Emoticon on wheels.","promoTeaser":"Emoticon on wheels.","keywords":["2015 Buick Encore"],"metaTitle":"2015 Buick Encore","metaKeywords":["2015 Buick Encore; Buick; SUV; crossover; American"],"metaDescription":"Emoticon on wheels.

Who needs a short (168.4-inch) little crossover riding on 18-inch wheels? But the Encore, made in Korea, has acquitted itself well. In fact, it has opened the door in a new market segment for compact crossovers. You sit up high, surveying the road as any visionary would, and although the turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine is small, it has enough push to keep you on the edge of the traffic wave. Body motions are well controlled, so there’s no bobbing when weaving. The Encore excels at commuting, and for Snow Belt duty, the available all-wheel drive is an excellent choice. Meanwhile, you can choose to get heated seats in the Encore's quiet cabin where Buick’s recent expositions of good taste come to the fore, especially in the mix of dark and light tones that can be chosen instead of the all-ebony interior. And like all others from the brand, the Encore is now equipped with 4G LTE with a Wi-Fi hot spot. As we’ve grown more accustomed to the Encore after the initial shock, we’ve come to understand the answer to our question of why. The Encore is fun, versatile, easy to maneuver, and cute.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nOnStar with 4G LTE and standard Wi-Fi hot spot","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Buick Encore","fileMasterId":103969160,"fileName":"buick-encore-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103969160/buick-encore-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Buick Encore","fileMasterId":103969157,"fileName":"buick-encore-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103969157/buick-encore-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Buick Encore</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/cool-tech/new-car-features/buick-encore-noise-cancellation/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Buick Encore Noise Cancellation</a> February 28, 2013 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/at-home/2013-buick-encore-awd/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2013 Buick Encore AWD</a> with video March 4, 2013","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45070,"make":"Buick","model":"Encore","year":2015},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:28:56.473-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547336475 }} },{ "_id":673502,"title":"2015 Aston Martin Vanquish","subTitle":"Fine stitching and indulgence.","slug":"2015-aston-martin-vanquish","promoTitle":"2015 Aston Martin Vanquish","promoTeaserSmall":"Fine stitching and indulgence.","promoTeaser":"Fine stitching and indulgence.","keywords":["2015 Aston Martin Vanquish"],"metaTitle":"2015 Aston Martin Vanquish","metaKeywords":["2015 Aston Martin Vanquish; Aston Martin; British; Coupe; convertible"],"metaDescription":"Fine stitching and indulgence.

This helps to reduce weight (the coupe’s is 3833 pounds), which helps to result in excellent handling and acceleration: 0 to 60 mph in 3.6 seconds and a top speed of 201 mph. A new eight-speed automatic transmission smoothly handles the output. There are three selectable driving modes: normal, sport, and track. With all this performance capability, many cars would clobber you with harsh ride responses, but not so the Vanquish: in fact, the Volante thinks its always tip-toeing along in a parade with Miss Strawberry Festival balanced on the rear cowl. (And it’s very quiet inside when the multilayer cloth top is raised.) Aston Martin offers 100,000 ways to configure the interior, including—yikes!—lime-green stitching, and what with choosing the body colors and wheels, well, your computer could crash.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

As a young adult I kicked around motor-racing, training to drive while I worked at a Brands Hatch satellite in Miami.  I've been race staff at the Detroit Grand Prix, worked TV coverage of Formula 1, Indy and NASCAR and done the occasional ride and drive program.  Eventually my racing aspirations gave way to a long held interest in filmmaking and I got my B.A. from the University of Michigan's burgeoning film program.  U of M taught me to write and introduced me to my excellent husband.  We spent five adventurous years in Los Angeles in the entertainment and publishing industries before returning to Ann Arbor where our lovely daughter came into the world.  Personally, I expend a good deal of energy on K-12 public education advocacy.  Professionally, I've been a freelance writer for the last ten years specializing in health issues and automotive content from a lifestyle perspective.

It’s big and bulky but, even around town, it’s amazingly agile, and the large, upright windows allow for a commanding view of the surroundings. The Land Cruiser only comes in one trim, but you won’t be disappointed: among the features are heated and ventilated front seats, an eight-inch infotainment display, a rear entertainment system, and a cooler box. A third row is also included, pushing seating capacity to eight. It can be split and folded flat to either side of the cargo area to allow for increased cargo space, although not as much as other vehicles where the third row disappears into the floor. The 5.7-liter V-8 eagerly rises to any occasion and allows the Land Cruiser to tow up to 8,500 pounds. As you might expect, fuel economy isn’t great: it gets a scant 13 mpg in the city but improves to 18 mpg on the open road. Adventurous types will like the Multi-Terrain Select system that allows the driver to choose one of several settings to match the current road or off-road conditions. For $81,475, it’s a little disappointing to see faux wood decorating the interior in this otherwise well-appointed sport-utility vehicle.

The base LE comes with helpful dual zone climate control, display screen, and reading lights for the spacious rear seat row. The XLE and Limited models get more standard luxury features like heated seats, a leather trimmed steering wheel, and keyless entry and start. The Limited is powered by the 3.5-liter V-6 mated to all-wheel drive, delivering the power and handling expected for $40,000. Otherwise the LE and XLE offer your choice of front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive and the XLE can be fitted with the base four-cylinder or upgraded to the V-6. For $2000, the V-6 is a bit of a no-brainer since it gets nearly the same gas millage as the four-cylinder and moves the Venza with an authority the four just can’t match.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

To this basic, inexpensive starting point, you can add a touchscreen, 16-inch alloy wheels, and a backup camera. Moving to the EX model, you find options packages that can give the car many unexpected luxury features. We do love a heated steering wheel. Heated and ventilated seats are available, too. The Koup is sporty, with the 2.0-liter and six-speed manual as standard but a powerful turbocharged 1.6-liter and an available automatic transmission with paddle shifters. EX and SX trim levels are offered, and the EX includes a leather-wrapped steering wheel and LED positioning lamps. Available eighteen-inch alloy wheels give the Koup an aggressive stance. Many of the sedan’s more premium options are found here in both trim levels. Sharing the Koup’s powertrain selection, the Forte5 is a handsome and more upscale four-door hatchback.

It’s more daring, slightly larger, and somehow more premium-looking than most. We do a double-take whenever we see one. In addition to the Optima’s good looks, there’s a powertrain and trim level for everybody. The LX, EX, and SX have the direct-injection 2.4-liter four-cylinder that puts out 192 horsepower and gets 34 highway mpg. The SX and SXL Turbos have the turbocharged, direct-injection 2.0-liter four-cylinder making 274 horsepower. The Hybrid and Hybrid EX combine the 2.4-liter four-cylinder with an electric drive system that incorporates a 47-kilowatt lithium-polymer battery. Each of the above cars uses a six-speed automatic. The LX is equipped with fog lamps, heated side mirrors, satellite radio, Bluetooth connectivity, a six-way power driver’s seat, and a package of electronically controlled safety and assistance features. The UVO2 eServices infotainment system is optional. The Hybrid’s standard equipment is much like that of the LX, while the Hybrid EX adds the infotainment system, rearview camera, and heated steering wheel. Climbing the trim level ladder to the SXL Turbo, we arrive at an elevated refuge of luxury of convenience, represented by a heated flat-bottom steering wheel with unique stitching, seats trimmed with Nappa leather trim, black gloss accents throughout the interior.

Naturally, all-wheel drive is available.

The Sorento is equipped with Flex Steer, which allows the driver to select the steering effort among comfort, normal, and sport modes.

Proving way more popular than expected after being released in 2009, the Soul brings a quirky kind of custom to the low-price arena. It was extensively revised for 2014, and the result was astonishing. The little runabout has a more solid feel and significantly improved ride and handling. Partly due to a stronger body, the vehicle is quieter. Kia spent some money to upgrade the interior, so it grew more attractive and interesting, with more comfortable seats and greater front legroom. The body’s front and rear were redone, adding drama, and the designers really smacked one out of the park when creating the Soul Exclaim’s cool new high-tech LED tail lamps. For the price, you’ll be surprised by the feature content, with an available heated and ventilated front seats and an infotainment system with excellent Android-based navigation display. The larger direct-injection 2.0-liter four-cylinder packs enough wallop to make this light-middleweight quite entertaining on a back road. For 2015, the Soul EV joined the lineup. Its 90-kilowatt battery can deliver up to 93 miles of range, a top speed of 90 mph, and 0 to 60 mph acceleration in 11.2 seconds. Whichever Soul you choose will be a long-lasting statement of individualism—and good thing a car like this is on the market.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nSoul EV","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Soul interior","fileMasterId":103914149,"fileName":"kia-soul-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103914149/kia-soul-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Soul","fileMasterId":103914188,"fileName":"kia-soul-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103914188/kia-soul-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Soul","fileMasterId":103914185,"fileName":"kia-soul-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103914185/kia-soul-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Soul","fileMasterId":103914146,"fileName":"kia-soul-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103914146/kia-soul-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Kia Soul</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/at-home/2015-kia-soul-ev/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Kia Soul EV</a> April 6, 2015","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":44657,"make":"Kia","model":"Soul","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43702,"make":"Kia","model":"Soul EV","year":2015},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:29:10.240-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547350241 }} },{ "_id":678557,"title":"BMW Made My Daughter a Driver","subTitle":"I took my teenage daughter to BMW Performance Driving School.","slug":"bmw-made-my-daughter-a-driver","promoTitle":"BMW Made My Daughter a Driver","promoTeaserSmall":"I took my teenage daughter to BMW Performance Driving School.","promoTeaser":"I took my teenage daughter to BMW Performance Driving School.","keywords":["BMW Made My Daughter a Driver"],"metaTitle":"BMW Made My Daughter a Driver - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["BMW Performance Driving School","driving school","teenage drivers","driving instruction","racing instruction","learning to drive","performance driving","high-perofrmance driving"],"metaDescription":"I took my teenage daughter to BMW Performance Driving School.","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2015-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2015-04-06T07:40:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2015-04-03T07:40:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":false,"url":"/kids-in-the-car/teenagers/bmw-made-my-daughter-a-driver/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[{"id":10379,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Christina Tynan-Wood","firstName":"Christina","lastName":"Tynan-Wood","jobTitle":"Contributor","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"I am a freelance writer in North Carolina, and I have been covering technology --including the technology in automobiles--since before Bill met Melinda or any of us met Google.

It’s well-equipped and luxurious. The powertrain is sporty, with 200 horsepower coming from the turbocharged direct-injection 2.0-liter four-cylinder and with the dual-clutch automatic gearbox providing nearly instantaneous shifting. But it’s still a front-wheel-drive chassis, which won’t return the same dynamic responses as the BMW. <br><br>The Eos’s chief claim to fame is the hardtop (with incorporated power-operated sunroof) that retracts in 25 seconds. The roof’s five elements neatly sandwich themselves and drop as smoothly as deviled ham. Leave the top up, and the trunk offers 10.5-cubic-feet of storage. As standard equipment, a wind blocker reduces turbulence in the passenger compartment. To counteract roofless vulnerability, the Eos has automatic rollover support, with support elements shooting out of their housings in a quarter-second if a possible rollover or collision is detected. The Eos lineup starts with the Komfort, which has the power sunroof, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and heated front seats. A five-inch touchscreen with navigation are also standard. For 2015, the Final Edition knocks last year’s Sport out of the lineup. It has a more aggressive stance, a lowered, sport-tuned suspension, 18-inch wheels, and black-and-beige leather seats. The Executive indulges with unique wheels, wood interior trim, and a 10-speaker audio system.

The frame is the same high-strength steel, but the new lighter sheetmetal is intended to better resist dents as well as help improve fuel economy, acceleration, hauling capacity, and stopping distances. With three cab choices, three bed lengths, four available engines, as well as five trim levels with increasing interior elegance and tech features, the line’s configurability is seemingly limitless and can take the F-150 from bare-bones work truck to powerful luxury hauler. Utility essentials like tow/haul mode, a cargo lamp, and roll stability and trailer sway control are standard on all F-150 models. The optional BoxLink system adds metal brackets and cleats allowing a variety of accessories—ramps, storage bins, bed dividers—to be secured in the cargo bed. Although the F-150’s styling is not as revolutionary as the much-touted aluminum construction, its stout front end, wide stance, and orderly interior suit its purpose nicely.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nAluminum alloy materials lighten the F-150 considerably.\n\n<h3>More from Us on the Ford F-150</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/2015-ford-f-150/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Ford F-150: Should You Buy It?</a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/ford-f-150-supercab-or-supercrew/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Real World Test: Ford F-150 SuperCab or SuperCrew?</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford F-150 interior","fileMasterId":106519130,"fileName":"ford-f150-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106519130/ford-f150-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford F-150","fileMasterId":106519067,"fileName":"ford-f150-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106519067/ford-f150-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford F-150","fileMasterId":106519127,"fileName":"ford-f150-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106519127/ford-f150-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Ford F-150</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/2015-ford-f-150/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Ford F-150, You Auto Know</a> March 9, 2015 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/on-the-road/ford-f-150-to-brooklyn/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Ford F-150 to Brooklyn</a> January 2, 2014 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/ford-f-150-supercab-or-supercrew/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Ford F-150: SuperCab or SuperCrew?</a> April 7, 2015","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":32720,"make":"Ford","model":"F-150","year":2015},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"8bfe9141-264d-3530-adde-b612c376b580","type":"mediaTag","name":"Trucks","path":"/Main/Trucks"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":10},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:29:20.297-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547360298 }} },{ "_id":679267,"title":"2015 Ford Flex","subTitle":"Utility in an old-school wrapper.","slug":"2015-ford-flex","promoTitle":"2015 Ford Flex","promoTeaserSmall":"Utility in an old-school wrapper.","promoTeaser":"Utility in an old-school wrapper.","keywords":["2015 Ford Flex"],"metaTitle":"2015 Ford Flex - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["2015 Ford Flex; Ford; sport-utility; SUV; crossover; American"],"metaDescription":"2015 Ford Flex: Utility in an old-school wrapper.

The long, low rectangle shape with a hint of old 1960s woody styling looks like nothing else on the road. With seating for seven and a decent 20 cubic feet of storage, to say this is a family-centric vehicle is an understatement. An optional second-row cooler compartment, back seat climate control, and electronic ports to create a Wi-Fi hot spot for passengers are all geared toward the tech-hungry and their kids. Parents will appreciate the fold-flat second- and third-row seats (powered third-row seats are optional) that extend the cargo capacity to 83 cubic feet. Large windows give the Flex’s cabin an airy feel, and the optional three-panel Vista Roof open’s it up even more. A plethora of video, navigation, and connectivity options are available if you add the Sync infotainment with MyFord Touch system that can be accessed by voice, steering wheel controls, or a tap on the eight-inch touchscreen. A backup sensor system that alerts you to obstructions behind the car is standard, but other safety options like inflatable seatbelts or blind spot warning are on higher trim levels only. All Flex models have a six-speed automatic transmission mated to either a normally aspirated or twin-turbocharged V-6 engine. The Flex Limited comes with the latter and all-wheel drive.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe two-tone roof can be dressed up in either Tuxedo Black Metallic and white or Deep Impact Blue Metallic and white.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Flex interior","fileMasterId":106523549,"fileName":"ford-flex-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106523549/ford-flex-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Flex","fileMasterId":106523504,"fileName":"ford-flex-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106523504/ford-flex-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45437,"make":"Ford","model":"Flex","year":2015},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:29:20.961-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547360962 }} },{ "_id":679275,"title":"2015 Ford Transit Connect","subTitle":"Small-business focused.","slug":"2015-ford-transit-connect","promoTitle":"2015 Ford Transit Connect","promoTeaserSmall":"Small-business focused.","promoTeaser":"Small-business focused.","keywords":["2015 Ford Transit Connect"],"metaTitle":"2015 Ford Transit Connect - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["2015 Ford Transit Connect; Ford; wagon; van; work van; American"],"metaDescription":"2015 Ford Transit Connect: Small-business focused.

Like a minivan, it has sliding doors on both sides, but has the option of hinged rear doors instead of the standard liftgate. Both body styles, are available in two wheelbase lengths, but while the van can only carry two people, the wagon can shuttle five or seven, in short- and long-wheelbase versions, respectively. With the rear seats folded, the short wheelbase can swallow 77 cubic feet of cargo, while the long wheelbase can transport over 100 cubic feet of stuff weighing up to 1,270 pounds. The van’s payload maxes out at 1,600 pounds and, with the appropriate fittings, can tow up to 2,000 pounds. <br><br>While the van is all business, the wagon can be trimmed in leather. Available comfort and convenience options include heated side mirrors, front and rear parking sensors, and Ford’s Sync infotainment system. Owners may also like the programmable MyKey, which allows speed and audio limits to be set for specific drivers. The van can be customized with numerous aftermarket products like bins, shelves, and partitions to create an individually tailored cargo space. There are two four-cylinder engines to choose from: a normally aspirated 2.5-liter and a turbocharged 1.6-liter; the former can be converted to use compressed or liquefied natural gas. A starting price in the low $20,000s makes the Transit Connect affordable for the smallest business.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe short-wheelbase wagon with the liftgate gets a rear cargo cover to disguise valuables in the back and Magnetic Metallic exterior paint.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Transit Connect interior","fileMasterId":106535810,"fileName":"ford-transitconnect-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106535810/ford-transitconnect-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Transit Connect","fileMasterId":106535807,"fileName":"ford-transitconnect-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106535807/ford-transitconnect-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Transit Connect","fileMasterId":106535804,"fileName":"ford-transitconnect-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106535804/ford-transitconnect-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45435,"make":"Ford","model":"Transit Connect","year":2015},{"id":"8bfe9141-264d-3530-adde-b612c376b580","type":"mediaTag","name":"Trucks","path":"/Main/Trucks"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:29:21.474-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547361475 }} },{ "_id":679811,"title":"2015 Chevrolet Corvette","subTitle":"Whether you choose the Stingray or the racy Z06, there is nothing like a Corvette.","slug":"2015-chevrolet-corvette","promoTitle":"2015 Chevrolet Corvette","promoTeaserSmall":"Whether you choose the Stingray or the racy Z06, there is nothing like a Corvette.","promoTeaser":"Whether you choose the Stingray or the racy Z06, there is nothing like a Corvette.","keywords":["2015 Chevrolet Corvette"],"metaTitle":"2015 Chevrolet Corvette","metaKeywords":["2015 Chevrolet Corvette; Chevrolet; Chevy; Vette; American; coupe; convertible; Z06"],"metaDescription":"Whether you choose the Stingray or the racy Z06, there is nothing like a Corvette.

That’s a screamin’ deal for a vehicle that offers so much basic utility and performs competently. On the other hand, the Grand Caravan can be given the home theater treatment with Blu-ray and DVD entertainment that includes two nine-inch screens, a remote, and the required HDMI connection and USB ports. As for the Caravan R/T, well, competing minivans hardly attempt to be sporty, but this bad boy goes for it with a monochromatic paint scheme, polished aluminum and gloss black wheels, and retuned suspension and steering. Inside are leather seats with red accent stitching and a ten-speaker audio system.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nDaytime running lights are now standard.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Dodge Grand Caravan interior","fileMasterId":109229297,"fileName":"dodge-grandcaravan-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109229297/dodge-grandcaravan-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Dodge Grand Caravan","fileMasterId":109229234,"fileName":"dodge-grandcaravan-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109229234/dodge-grandcaravan-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Dodge Grand Caravan","fileMasterId":109229291,"fileName":"dodge-grandcaravan-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109229291/dodge-grandcaravan-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45632,"make":"Dodge","model":"Grand Caravan","year":2015},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:29:25.215-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547365216 }} },{ "_id":680160,"title":"2015 Bentley Flying Spur","subTitle":"Bespoke for the road or track.","slug":"2015-bentley-flying-spur","promoTitle":"2015 Bentley Flying Spur","promoTeaserSmall":"Bespoke for the road or track.","promoTeaser":"Bespoke for the road or track.","keywords":["2015 Bentley Flying Spur"],"metaTitle":"2015 Bentley Flying Spur","metaKeywords":["2015 Bentley Flying Spur; Bentley; British; sedan"],"metaDescription":"Bespoke for the road or track.

Available in either a four- or five-seat configuration, the Flying Spur is more than adequately powered by either a 626-horsepower 6.0-liter twin-turbo W-12 engine or a slightly more modest 500-hp 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8. The recently added V-8 isn’t necessarily for the environmentally conscious—because no one buys a V-8 to save on trips to the gas pump. Rather, it’s tuned to be sportier thanks in part to the weight savings that come from using a lighter engine, and it presents different driving dynamics. But still, the W-12 emits that low, unmistakable engine sound that only $200,000 can buy. The interior of the Flying Spur is heady, with luxurious materials at every turn and touch, including polished or matte metals on the door, supple leather seats, and wool floor mats. And although the sedan features some of the latest safety and connectivity options, such as parking sensors and Wi-Fi, no one buys a Bentley for its cutting-edge technology, unless, of course, they’re talking about the massaging front seats.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe V-8 gets more power, more customization options.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Bentley Continental interior","fileMasterId":109271006,"fileName":"bentley-flyingspur-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109271006/bentley-flyingspur-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Bentley Continental","fileMasterId":109270835,"fileName":"bentley-flyingspur-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109270835/bentley-flyingspur-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43159,"make":"Bentley","model":"Flying Spur","year":2015},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:29:25.765-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547365766 }} },{ "_id":680163,"title":"2015 Cadillac ATS","subTitle":"A well-equipped and refined performance compact.","slug":"2015-cadillac-ats","promoTitle":"2015 Cadillac ATS","promoTeaserSmall":"A well-equipped and refined performance compact.","promoTeaser":"A well-equipped and refined performance compact.","keywords":["2015 Cadillac ATS"],"metaTitle":"2015 Cadillac ATS","metaKeywords":["2015 Cadillac ATS; Cadillac; sedan; coupe; American"],"metaDescription":"A well-equipped and refined performance compact.

But if you can’t wait until then—or don’t need 464 hp to go to the grocery store—performance-minded buyers will still be pleased with the ATS’s quick reflexes and a sporty interior that lends a cockpit-like feel to the driver’s seat.

Based on the award-winning Chevrolet Volt's platform, the ELR is a technological feat packaged in gorgeous exterior design, offering environment-conscious buyers a way to drive electric without the range anxiety. A fully charged ELR can travel up to 37 miles using only the electricity stored in its 16.5-kwH electric battery, but after its range-extending engine kicks in, the ELR achieves approximately 33 mpg and can travel 340 miles on a tank of gas. Setting it apart from the Volt is a sport-tuned chassis, the same one used by the CTS. The vehicle’s driving modes help make the vehicle handle a bit more like its Cadillac siblings. But you don’t buy the ELR because you like to accelerate off the line—you buy the ELR because you like alternative propulsion technology. On the downside, the ELR seats only four, which is one less than some of its competitors.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2016</h3>\nRevised electric drive system for more power and torque; OnStar with 4G LTE and standard built-in Wi-Fi hot spot.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Cadillac ELR interior","fileMasterId":109499066,"fileName":"cadillac-elr-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109499066/cadillac-elr-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Cadillac ELR","fileMasterId":109499003,"fileName":"cadillac-elr-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109499003/cadillac-elr-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Cadillac ELR","fileMasterId":109499063,"fileName":"cadillac-elr-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109499063/cadillac-elr-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Cadillac ELR</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/things-to-buy/automotive-holiday-baubles/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Automotive Holiday Baubles</a> November 11, 2013","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45443,"make":"Cadillac","model":"ELR","year":2016},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:29:26.703-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547366704 }} },{ "_id":685567,"title":"2015 GMC Acadia","subTitle":"A luxurious SUV.","slug":"2015-gmc-acadia","promoTitle":"2015 GMC Acadia","promoTeaserSmall":"A luxurious SUV.","promoTeaser":"A luxurious SUV.","keywords":["2015 GMC Acadia"],"metaTitle":"2015 GMC Acadia","metaKeywords":["2015 GMC Acadia; GMC; SUV; crossover; American"],"metaDescription":"A luxurious SUV.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"New Car Features","id":1034782,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/new-car-features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-28T12:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"4g-lte-promolarge","title":"4G Lte Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119692280/4g-lte-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":119692280,"fileName":"4g-lte-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-28T12:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"4g-lte-promolarge","title":"4G Lte Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119692280/4g-lte-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":119692280,"fileName":"4g-lte-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-28T12:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"4g-lte-header","title":"4G Lte Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119692283/4g-lte-header.jpg","fileMasterId":119692283,"fileName":"4g-lte-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":948972,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"General Motors is going all in for 4G LTE Wi-Fi.

Big downside, though: It may make the driver very lonely.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h3>More to Read:</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/events/2016-hyundai-tucson/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Do You Need Wireless Internet in the Car?</a> March 19, 2015","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":38473,"make":"Cadillac","model":"Escalade","year":2015},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":6},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:29:31.911-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547371912 }} },{ "_id":687122,"title":"Pro/Con: Leather or Cloth?","subTitle":"Molly likes her cars swathed in leather.

It is available in Passenger and Cargo models, each of which is well conceived. They come with either V-6 or V-8 power and a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Passenger van has a 41.7-inch side opening and seats up to 12 occupants in four rows. The three rows to the aft have split benches, and the individual sections can be removed and repositioned. Nissan claims 324 different configurations. Each seating position has its own headrest and an integrated seatbelt, so there’s no “seatbelt jungle” that anyone who’s climbed onto an airport or hotel shuttle is familiar with. Rear passenger comfort is ensured, thanks to dual rotating overhead A/C vents and available reading lamps in each row. Heat vents are built into the floor. \n<br><br>\nAfter taking advantage of the cheaper-by-the-dozen offer at the drive-in, everyone will be happy to find that cupholders slide out from beneath the seat cushion. Up front, there are dual-zone climate controls and available heated seats. The infotainment system now incorporates a text-to-voice feature. Productivity is enhanced by the same central “mobile office” center console unit familiar from the Titan pickup. The van’s available rearview camera seems like an essential feature. Standing even taller beside the Passenger version, the NV Cargo is available in 1500, HD 2500, and HD 3500 grades and, like its sibling, S, SV, and SL trim. High-roof variants are available. The Cargo takes advantage of the same wide-opening rear doors, available third-row 12-volt outlet and cargo-area 120-volt outlet to run devices, tools, or accessories. The Passenger van tows up to 8,700 pounds, and the Cargo van up to 9,500 pounds.

The standard engine is a potent, direct-injection 3.8-liter V-6 that produces 348 horsepower. In the agile Genesis Coupe, a 6-speed manual transmission is standard; the Ultimate’s available 8-speed automatic has a performance-oriented rev-matching feature for smooth downshifts. All-wheel drive is an option with the V-6 in either body style. But in the sedan, our experience leads to a preference for the smooth, powerful V-8 in the sedan. In size and level of specification, the Genesis falls just short of the top-of-the-line Hyundai Equus. It’s not quite cavernous inside, like the Equus, but it’s roomier than most of its direct competitors. The interior is gorgeous with available matte wood trim, aluminum accents, and leather upholstery that will continually delight. The Sedan 5.0 has standard heated and cooled front seats. (Heated rear seats are only available in the Sedan 3.8 with all-wheel drive, which also can be ordered with a heated steering wheel.) And of course, there are audio speakers and safety features galore.

Although it’s dated, the Tucson still has a competitive level of specification and feature content. The GLS comes with an efficient 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and 6-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, all-wheel drive, optional. Six air bags, active front head restraints, electronic stability control, hill-start assist, and downhill braking control are standard. The Popular Equipment package adds a 4.3-inch infotainment touchscreen, power driver’s seat, and leatherette seat trim. There’s also a tech package with a seven-inch screen and navigation, panoramic roof, and premium audio. The Tucson SE and Limited are equipped with the more powerful and slightly thirstier direct-injection 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. The Limited’s standard equipment list includes eighteen-inch alloy wheels, LED tail lamps, and a chrome grille and chrome door handles.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

To that end, the 4-series fits the bill. Its sportiness is emphasized with an elongated, athletic exterior and a more rigid chassis than the 3-series. Mucking up the formula a bit is the recently introduced 4-Series Gran Coupe, which gets four doors but retains the fastback styling of the coupe. Although the 4-series and 3-series models share the same turbocharged 2.0-liter in-line-four and turbocharged 3.0-liter in-line-six engines, the 4-series wheelbase is bit longer, its body wider, and roof lower than its compact sedan sibling, which results in a more dynamic driving machine that feels firmly connected to the road. Rounding out the different driving characteristics is the standard speed-sensitive steering— variable-assist sport steering and adaptive suspension are available as part of the optional dynamic handling package. Optional technology is available on every aspect of the 4-series, from the Comfort Access that opens the trunk with a small foot movement under the center of the rear bumper, to the pedestrian detection, speed limit sign detection, collision avoidance, head-up display, and Google search-based points-of-interest for the navigation system. Rear seats in the Gran Coupe hatchback have a 40/20/40 split help make the most of cargo capacity.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nRevised package features, new leather and material options, Comfort Access now includes the hands-free trunk closing function, and the Gran Coupe and M4 models are all new.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 4-series interior","fileMasterId":124062068,"fileName":"BMW-4series-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124062068/BMW-4series-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 4-series","fileMasterId":124062065,"fileName":"BMW-4series-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124062065/BMW-4series-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 4-series","fileMasterId":124062062,"fileName":"BMW-4series-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124062062/BMW-4series-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the BMW 4 Series</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/life-with-jean/the-lunacy/what-i-drove-last-weekend-bmw-4-series/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">What I Drove Last Weekend: BMW 4 Series</a> February 18, 2015","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":42478,"make":"BMW","model":"4-Series","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":39746,"make":"BMW","model":"M4","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:29:38.022-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547378023 }} },{ "_id":690791,"title":"2015 BMW X1","subTitle":"Downsize without compromise.","slug":"2015-bmw-x1","promoTitle":"2015 BMW X1","promoTeaserSmall":"Downsize without compromise.","promoTeaser":"Downsize without compromise.","keywords":["2015 BMW X1"],"metaTitle":"2015 BMW X1","metaKeywords":["2015 BMW X1; BMW; sport-utility; crossover; SUV; German"],"metaDescription":"Downsize without compromise.

Sized more like a beefy hatchback than a crossover, it’s tempting empty nesters to downsize their vehicles without giving up the commanding view to which they’ve become accustomed, and it’s offering young families and city dwellers decent cargo capacity without suburban proportions. The X1’s equipment is straightforward but generous, with a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine that produces 240 horsepower mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission, and it’s available with either standard rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The interior retains that clean, Bavarian styling synonymous with the BMW brand, and its driving dynamics reflects the sportiness of its new, self-described “sport activity vehicle” classification. With a maximum of 34.9 cubic inches of legroom, the rear seats aren’t as cramped as you might expect in a compact crossover, and keep in mind that the 25 cubic feet of cargo capacity behind the second row, which more than doubles to 56 with the seats folded flat, had to come from somewhere.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nMinor upholstery changes.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW X1 interior","fileMasterId":124066637,"fileName":"BMW-X1-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124066637/BMW-X1-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW X1","fileMasterId":124066631,"fileName":"BMW-X1-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124066631/BMW-X1-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW X1","fileMasterId":124066625,"fileName":"BMW-X1-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124066625/BMW-X1-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the BMW X1</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/2014-bmw-x1/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">BMW X1 xDrive 28i</a> March 27, 2014","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45451,"make":"BMW","model":"X1","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:29:38.338-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547378340 }} },{ "_id":690817,"title":"2015 BMW i8","subTitle":"Going green never looked so good.","slug":"2015-bmw-i8","promoTitle":"2015 BMW i8","promoTeaserSmall":"Going green never looked so good.","promoTeaser":"Going green never looked so good.","keywords":["2015 BMW i8"],"metaTitle":"2015 BMW i8","metaKeywords":["2015 BMW i8; BMW; hybrid; coupe; German"],"metaDescription":"Going green never looked so good.

But it’s still a plug-in hybrid, which means that at the push of a button, it can operate on electric-only mode and responsibly motor around town emitting nary a tailpipe emission. With the gasoline engine disengaged, the i8 offers a pure EV range of approximately 22 miles and a top speed of 75 mph, but when making full use of its electric motors and its three-cylinder, 1.5-liter gasoline engine, the coupe produces an output of 357 horsepower and maxes out at an electronically controlled top speed of 155 mph while still getting an average combined fuel economy of 76 mpg. If you’ve drained the lithium-ion battery, you can expect an estimated 29 mpg when using only the gasoline engine. There are four different trim packages—the limited-edition Pure Impulse World is the most expensive at $10,800—each with its own interior trim options. As you might expect in a $140,000 vehicle, the standard features list is comprehensive.

The B-Class offers some of Mercedes’ more advanced safety features, including Collision Prevention Assist Plus, which automatically applies the brakes if it detects the vehicle is not braking hard enough to avoid an impending collision. You will still pay extra for features that you might expect standard on a vehicle this pricey and technologically advanced, such as heated seats and a rearview camera. <br><br>But as with most electric cars, the majority of the attention tends to be paid to what’s under the hood rather than interior amenities. The electric B-Class is equipped with an electric motor that offers an equivalent 177 horsepower and an impressive 251 pound-feet of torque and moves it from 0 to 60 mph in 7.9 seconds. Mercedes estimates that the real-world driving range of the B-Class is nearly 100 miles, but the EPA estimate is a little lower at 87 miles. Charging times from empty are two hours for a 60-mile driving range and 3.5 hours for a full charge. There isn’t a quick charge option. This means you need to plan your road trips accordingly. However, Mercedes has equipped the electric B-Class with an “extended range” option that makes the battery’s full 36-kWh capacity available, and increases the estimated driving range by 25 to 30 percent. But keep in mind, the fine print states that overuse of this option can increase battery degradation.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nThe B-Class Electric Drive is all-new for 2015.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz B-class interior","fileMasterId":129235610,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/129235610/mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz B-class","fileMasterId":129235604,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/129235604/mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz B-class","fileMasterId":129235598,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/129235598/mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz B-class","fileMasterId":129235595,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/129235595/mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45967,"make":"Mercedes-Benz","model":"B-Class","year":2015},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:29:40.445-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547380446 }} },{ "_id":691896,"title":"2015 Mercedes-Benz G-Class","subTitle":"The intrepid classic soldiers on, inimitable and unforgettable.","slug":"2015-mercedes-benz-g-class","promoTitle":"2015 Mercedes-Benz G-Class","promoTeaserSmall":"The intrepid classic soldiers on, inimitable and unforgettable.","promoTeaser":"The intrepid classic soldiers on, inimitable and unforgettable.","keywords":["2015 Mercedes-Benz G-Class"],"metaTitle":"2015 Mercedes-Benz G-Class","metaKeywords":["2015 Mercedes-Benz G-class;

Although not technically an off-roader, it does have an available 4x4 drivetrain on both cargo and passenger versions equipped with the V-6, which makes it more capable in inclement weather. And because of its tall and top-heavy vehicle—especially if you choose the high roof option—buyers will appreciate the standard crosswind assist for additional stability. Optional safety features abound, including blind-spot assist, lane-keeping assist, and high beam assist. While a 5.8-inch color display and Bluetooth connectivity are standard, a rearview camera is optional.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Engine variants for this model include a 3.5-liter V-6 with 302 horsepower and a twin-turbo 2.1-liter four-cylinder diesel with 200 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque. Both engines are paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission, and while you can get the GLK350 with rear- or all-wheel drive, the diesel version is only available with the latter. At 18 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway, fuel economy is decent but not exceptional in the GLK350 4MATIC, although dropping AWD will improve the numbers by 1 mpg in both the city and highway ratings. To get a significant bump, you’ll have to opt for the diesel, if you can still find it. <br>\n<br>\nLegroom is a bit snug for rear passengers with only 35.1 inches to spread out and, despite its boxy hindquarters, the GLK-Class's cargo capacity is only 16.5 cubic feet with the rear seats up; that number jumps to 54.7 with the second row folded flat. Like most Mercedes-Benz vehicles, the GLK's interior is elegant, but most of the bells and whistles that many drivers have come to expect in new vehicles are optional features, such as navigation, a rearview camera, and a power liftgate. That usually isn’t much of a drawback for luxury buyers willing to shell out the extra thousands for the German crossover’s premium packages, but as with most end-of-cycle cars, they’ll probably have to take what they can get from what’s left on the lot.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nNo major changes.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz GLK-class interior","fileMasterId":128833844,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-glkclass-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/128833844/mercedesbenz-glkclass-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz GLK-class","fileMasterId":128833877,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-glkclass-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/128833877/mercedesbenz-glkclass-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz GLK-class","fileMasterId":128833841,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-glkclass-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/128833841/mercedesbenz-glkclass-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45260,"make":"Mercedes-Benz","model":"GLK-Class","year":2015},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:29:44.416-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547384417 }} },{ "_id":693012,"title":"The Best and Worst Cities for Drivers","subTitle":"Of 100 cities and towns, where do you suffer the most or least?

Detroit has the third highest rate of car theft, in addition to a population of 680,000 in which one out of every three residents lives below the poverty line.

As minivans grew in popularity, wagons began to disappear from the U.S. car scene—much to the consternation of U.S. wagon aficionados. So the announcement that Volvo would be bringing a wagon back to the U.S. market was greeted with great anticipation. \n<br><br>\nThe Volvo V60 has lived up to—and exceeded—expectations. Essentially a wagon version of the S60 sedan, the V60 has many of the same powertrains and features as its sibling. Like the S60, the V60 is available with front- or all-wheel drive, with a four-, five-, or six-cylinder engine, and with a six- or eight-speed automatic transmission. Standard equipment includes heated mirrors, dual-zone climate control, 40/20/40-split rear seats, Bluetooth, and a sunroof. \n<br><br>\nWhat the wagon version offers that the sedan lacks is 43.8 cubic feet of cargo capacity and a Cross Country version. Yes, that’s right, Volvo has brought back the Cross Country name with a go-anywhere version of the V60. The Cross Country is differentiated from the V60 by a honeycomb grille, skid plates, side scuff plates, black fender extensions, and ground clearance that has been raised by 2.6 inches, to 7.9 inches total. The Cross Country is powered by the 250-horsepower five-cylinder and, naturally, comes with all-wheel drive.\n<br><br>\nThe V60 is fun to drive, with well-balanced handling and strong acceleration, no matter which engine you choose. On top of that, the four-cylinder gets 29 mpg in combined city/highway driving, which makes it both fun and practical.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nThe Volvo V60 made its debut for the 2015 model year.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volvo V60","fileMasterId":132183203,"fileName":"volvo-v60-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132183203/volvo-v60-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volvo V60","fileMasterId":132183104,"fileName":"volvo-v60-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132183104/volvo-v60-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volvo V60","fileMasterId":132183200,"fileName":"volvo-v60-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132183200/volvo-v60-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":38662,"make":"Volvo","model":"V60","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":44040,"make":"Volvo","model":"V60 Cross Country","year":2015},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:29:46.063-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547386064 }} },{ "_id":694927,"title":"2016 Mazda 6","subTitle":"The mid-size sedan that will be as fun to drive as it is to look at.","slug":"2016-mazda-6","promoTitle":"2016 Mazda 6","promoTeaserSmall":"The mid-size sedan that will be as fun to drive as it is to look at.","promoTeaser":"The mid-size sedan that will be as fun to drive as it is to look at.","keywords":["2016 Mazda 6"],"metaTitle":"2016 Mazda 6 -

With seats in place, the Fit offers 16.6 cubic feet of cargo space, which is more than you'll see in competitors such as the Chevrolet Sonic or Ford Fiesta hatchback (both at 14.9) and the Kia Rio five-door (12.3).  Fold down the seats—which go flat thanks to the instant-folding Magic Seat feature—and the yield is 52.7 cubic feet, again more than the competition. Fuel economy skirts around the all-important 40-mpg level on the highway, depending on whether you choose the more efficient continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) or the six-speed manual. The base LX and midlevel EX models have the six-speed manual as standard, while the top EX-L model comes only with the CVT. Paddle shifters are an option to liven up your CVT experience on the EX; they're standard on the EX-L.  Other creature comforts if you opt for the EX-L are leather-trimmed seats and steering wheel, heated front seats, and, for an added $1,000, a navigation system with voice recognition and HD digital traffic, making the best use of the seven-inch touchscreen. (That screen is also found on the EX, but the LX gets a five-inch touchscreen.) Both EX and EX-L models have options including a power moonroof with a tilt feature, push-button start, and Honda's Lane Watch, which shows live video from a camera on your passenger's-side mirror when you turn your right turn signal on (EX, EX-L). That's what you call exceeding expectations; not only will you get used to this feature, you won't remember how you got along without it. You won't forget the diminutive size of the car you're driving  if you choose the Fit, but you won't feel like you've cheaped out; in fact, you'll feel like you're driving a modern, well-appointed, up-to-date vehicle, a good feeling anytime and especially at this price point.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2016:</h3>\nThe Fit's third generation was all new for 2015 and continues unchanged this year.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542362,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542362/honda-fit-2016-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542275,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542275/honda-fit-2016-06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542371,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542371/honda-fit-2016-07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542272,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542272/honda-fit-2016-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542278,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-08.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542278/honda-fit-2016-08.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542374,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542374/honda-fit-2016-header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542269,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542269/honda-fit-2016-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542359,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542359/honda-fit-2016-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45960,"make":"Honda","model":"Fit","year":2016},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"71d39f07-0bc5-39bd-9468-12085dc13b7c","type":"mediaTag","name":"First_Car","path":"/Main/First_Car"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:29:46.903-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547386904 }} },{ "_id":695322,"title":"2016 Honda Accord","subTitle":"Decades later, freshly updated, this is still a rock-solid choice among mid-size sedans.","slug":"2016-honda-accord","promoTitle":"2016 Honda Accord","promoTeaserSmall":"Decades later, freshly updated, this is still a rock-solid choice among mid-size sedans.","promoTeaser":"Decades later, freshly updated, this is still a rock-solid choice among mid-size sedans.","keywords":["2016 Honda Accord"],"metaTitle":"2016 Honda Accord  -

After all, the Honda Accord has been around for almost forty years and has been manufactured in the U.S. since 1982. More than 10 million have been built in North America, in fact, so many that the Honda dealers could put up a McDonald's-style \"Millions Served\" sign if they wanted. But does ubiquity lead to contempt? Not in our book. The Accord has won a place in so many driveways precisely because it's so well executed. Buyers flock to it knowing they can count on it to be well built and reliable as well as comfortable and drivable. If there's a little less excitement than with a lot of other cars you could choose, well, it's a mid-size, front-wheel-drive sedan, not a sports car. 2016 brings changes to the ninth-generation Accord that was introduced for 2013.
