While conventional in every way, the interior is also attractively designed and laid out. The woven cloth upholstery of the LX improves to knit in the EX and leather in the SX. Power windows and locks along with remote keyless entry and Bluetooth connectivity are optional in the LX and standard in the other two. Antilock brakes, stability control, and hill-start assist are standard through the range. Standard in the sedan and 5-door is a rear defroster, and the 5-door adds standard heated, power-operated mirrors. If you’re looking for heated seats and steering wheel, you’ll have to move up to the SX. The Rio has become more refined, and in doing so it proves that spirited performance and good design can be available to penny pinchers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3> \r\nSilverstone beige exterior paint is no longer offered","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Rio sedan","fileMasterId":103916423,"fileName":"kia-rio-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103916423/kia-rio-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Rio sedan","fileMasterId":103916420,"fileName":"kia-rio-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103916420/kia-rio-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Rio hatchback","fileMasterId":103916417,"fileName":"kia-rio-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103916417/kia-rio-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Rio hatchback","fileMasterId":103916414,"fileName":"kia-rio-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103916414/kia-rio-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":48795,"make":"Kia","model":"Rio","year":2015},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"71d39f07-0bc5-39bd-9468-12085dc13b7c","type":"mediaTag","name":"First_Car","path":"/Main/First_Car"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:36:50.081-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547810082 }} },{ "_id":678556,"title":"2015 Scion xB","subTitle":"Top box.","slug":"2015-scion-xb","promoTitle":"2015 Scion xB","promoTeaserSmall":"Top box.","promoTeaser":"Top box.","keywords":["2015 Scion xB"],"metaTitle":"2015 Scion xB","metaKeywords":["2015 Scion xB; Scion; wagon; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"Top box.

One of the most interesting detours the xB intender can take is through the accessories list. For the body, add fog lamps, carbon fiber window trim, and a saucy rear spoiler. For the cabin, rummage through choices among totes, nets, trays, liners, mats—even a sport steering wheel. To change the look and improve handling, consider the slew of suspension parts and brake components, many of them painted red. Even nineteen-inch wheels are offered. The choicest option is the dealer-installed BeSpoke premium audio system. It features voice controlled navigation, media, and calling and now has “one shot” destination input capability that allows you to say an entire address. BeSpoke also integrates the downloadable Aha app, opening up a world of audio possibilities. Only a few other low-priced vehicles offer this level of customizing potential, giving the owner the chance to say this xB is like no other.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nStandard rearview camera.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Scion xB interior","fileMasterId":103911284,"fileName":"scion-xb-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103911284/scion-xb-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Scion xB","fileMasterId":103911281,"fileName":"scion-xb-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103911281/scion-xb-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Scion xB","fileMasterId":103911275,"fileName":"scion-xb-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103911275/scion-xb-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Scion xB","fileMasterId":103911272,"fileName":"scion-xb-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103911272/scion-xb-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45697,"make":"Scion","model":"xB","year":2015},{"id":"71d39f07-0bc5-39bd-9468-12085dc13b7c","type":"mediaTag","name":"First_Car","path":"/Main/First_Car"},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:36:50.309-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547810310 }} },{ "_id":678681,"title":"2015 Kia Soul EV","subTitle":"The hamster wheels go electric.","slug":"2015-kia-soul-ev","promoTitle":"2015 Kia Soul EV","promoTeaserSmall":"The hamster wheels go electric.","promoTeaser":"The hamster wheels go electric.","keywords":["2015 Kia Soul EV"],"metaTitle":"2015 Kia Soul EV","metaKeywords":["2015 Kia Soul EV","Kia Soul","electric car","charging stations","EVs","Jean's Driveway"],"metaDescription":"The hamster wheels go electric.","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2015-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2015-04-06T08:24:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2015-04-05T08:24:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":false,"url":"/jeans-driveway/at-home/2015-kia-soul-ev/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

The 2.0T Executive adopts the automatic gearbox as standard, has its own 18-inch wheels, and piles on the premium features, including a more advanced navigation and infotainment system. Crowning the lineup is the VR6 4Motion Executive. The V-6 and six-speed automatic transmission team up with all-wheel drive for ultimate capability. Inside, the front seats are ventilated and the driver’s seat has a massage function. The premium audio system uses 10 speakers.

Buttons and switchgear are new as well. Outside and inside, the Touareg is simple and uncluttered, if a bit conservative. There are three powertrains. The 3.6-liter V-6 has to motivate the nearly 4700-pound vehicle (which increases to 5260 pounds in Hybrid form). We would prefer the TDI, which gets 406 pound-feet of torque from the turbo-diesel, direct-injection 3.0-liter V-6. For one thing, it would perform much better when equipped with the towing package that enables the Touareg to pull a 7700-pound trailer. Under best conditions, the TDI has a 765-mile range. Every model, even the Hybrid, has the same advanced eight-speed automatic transmission with manual gear control. The Hybrid can reach a speed of 31 mph in electric driving mode, and it gains efficiency from stop-start technology and regenerative braking.

There are four Edge models and three engine choices, all of them served by Ford’s SelectShift automatic with steering-wheel-mounted paddles for manual control of the six-speed transmission. Increases in height, wheelbase, and overall length as well as interior improvements such as thinner seats have increased passenger and cargo volumes by 5.5 and 7.0 cubic feet, respectively. <br>\n<br>\nThe interior was totally redesigned as well with higher-quality materials and more storage options. The Sync infotainment system with MyFord Touch display is found on SEL trim and above. There are three engine options: an improved version of the 2.0-liter EcoBoost and two new V-6s, a 2.7-liter EcoBoost and a 3.5-liter. A new Titanium level Edge comes equipped with a comprehensive list of safety features including blind spot warning, lane departure warning, and inflatable second-row seatbelts.

The exterior received a refresh that gives it the critically acclaimed Fusion-style narrow grille and thinner head- and taillamps. LEDs are optional for both. The cabin gets new seat trim options, switches, and a revised center console and glove box. A heated steering wheel is newly available as well as a full suite of safety and connectivity technology including a rearview camera (standard for 2015), blind spot and lane keeping systems, and the Sync infotainment system with AppLink. The Focus also received a new stability control system and revised suspensions, front and rear, and the small but spunky 1.0-liter three-cylinder from the Fiesta is now available. <br><br>The ST model is the performance-oriented Focus. It comes only with a six-speed manual transmission to go with a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, and it's fitted inside and out with sporty color schemes. Besides the Focus ST, there are four additional sedan or hatch models to suit every taste: the essentials only S, the mid-level SE, the loaded Titanium, and the plug-in Focus Electric hatch. The latter can reach 84 miles per hour and has an estimated range of 76 miles. Inside, an earth-friendly bio-foam fills the cushions, and the seat fabric is made entirely from recycled materials. But those who put a priority on green technology, can feel good about choosing any of the Focus models since even the gas versions of Focus are built in part with solar power at Ford’s Wayne, Michigan, plant. In either body style or any trim, the Focus offers a roomy interior in a small, parking friendly and fuel-efficient package.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nA freshened exterior and interior, revised front and rear suspensions, 1.0-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine, and the rearview camera is now standard.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Focus interior","fileMasterId":106524755,"fileName":"ford-focus-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106524755/ford-focus-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Focus","fileMasterId":106524752,"fileName":"ford-focus-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106524752/ford-focus-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Ford Focus</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround/2016-ford-focus-rs-jeans-driveway/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2016 Ford Focus RS: Jean's Driveway</a> March 10, 2015 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/car-on-the-road/2015-ford-focus-st/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Ford Focus ST</a> March 23, 2015 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/events/chevrolet-cruze-and-ford-focus/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Chevrolet Cruze and Ford Focus</a> April 15, 2014","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":41536,"make":"Ford","model":"Focus","year":2015},{"id":"71d39f07-0bc5-39bd-9468-12085dc13b7c","type":"mediaTag","name":"First_Car","path":"/Main/First_Car"},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":7},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:36:52.339-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547812339 }} },{ "_id":679269,"title":"2015 Ford Fusion","subTitle":"Looks help this mid-size sedan stand out in a crowded segment.","slug":"2015-ford-fusion","promoTitle":"2015 Ford Fusion","promoTeaserSmall":"Looks help this mid-size sedan stand out in a crowded segment.","promoTeaser":"Looks help this mid-size sedan stand out in a crowded segment.","keywords":["2015 Ford Fusion"],"metaTitle":"2015 Ford Fusion - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["2015 Ford Fusion;

For serious work duty, the van has multiple axle choices and, when properly equipped, can tow as much as 6,700 pounds and carry up to 487 cubic feet or 4,500 pounds of cargo. The wagon is offered in two trims, XL and XLT, and can be outfitted to carry eight, ten, twelve, or fifteen passengers. There are three engine choices, including a diesel five-cylinder and a 3.7-liter V-6 that has flex-fuel and natural gas options. There are also a variety of door setups, including either 60/40 hinged or sliding on the passenger's side, dual sliding, or 50/50 split doors in the rear. Window configurations are abundant, and fleet buyers will appreciate the option of factory-installed auxiliary switches for heavy-duty add-ons. Prices can climb quickly, especially with the addition of the $9,690 diesel engine or the $10,025 cost of increasing the gross vehicle weight rating, but the Transit is still a competitive choice.

Maybe you want the amped-up 426-horsepower V-8 available on the SS model? Or maybe you’d like to fly, muscle-bound into the future in the all-aluminum, supercharged V-8-powered ZL1?

The Traverse also has numerous optional active safety features, including lane departure warning, side blind-zone alert, and forward collision alert, plus rear cross-traffic alerts and rearview camera.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"\r\n<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nAvailable Siri Eyes Free, new interior and exterior colors, and a new 18-inch wheel design.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Chevrolet Traverse interior","fileMasterId":107703632,"fileName":"chevrolet-traverse-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/107703632/chevrolet-traverse-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Chevrolet Traverse","fileMasterId":107703584,"fileName":"chevrolet-traverse-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/107703584/chevrolet-traverse-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Chevrolet Traverse","fileMasterId":107703629,"fileName":"chevrolet-traverse-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/107703629/chevrolet-traverse-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Chevrolet Traverse</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/4-crossovers-that-carry-7-in-style/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">4 Crossovers That Carry 7 in Style</a> May 17, 2013","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45469,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Traverse","year":2015},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:36:55.386-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547815387 }} },{ "_id":679829,"title":"2015 Chevrolet Volt","subTitle":"A slick hybrid that can travel 30 miles on an electric charge.","slug":"2015-chevrolet-volt","promoTitle":"2015 Chevrolet Volt","promoTeaserSmall":"A slick hybrid that can travel 30 miles on an electric charge.","promoTeaser":"A slick hybrid that can travel 30 miles on an electric charge.","keywords":["2015 Chevrolet Volt"],"metaTitle":"2015 Chevrolet Volt","metaKeywords":["2015 Chevrolet Volt; Chevrolet; Chevy; sedan; hybrid; American"],"metaDescription":"A slick hybrid that can travel 30 miles on an electric charge.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

The Challenger R/T Scat Pack’s 6.4-liter V-8 produces 485 horsepower, launches the car from 0 to 60 mph in the mid-four-second range, and propels it to 182 mph. If the Scat Pack’s potential isn’t great enough, consider the Challenger Hellcat. Its supercharged, 6.2-liter V-8 produces 707 horsepower and potential outrage in Congress. Even the entry-level Challenger SXT gets 305 horsepower from its 3.6-liter V-6. <br><br>All Challengers now have new headlamps and taillamps, and the running gear is improved by the addition of an eight-speed automatic transmission (with electronic shifter) and electrically assisted power steering. Inside the cabin, the driver benefits from a new customizable TFT display instrument panel, and an 8.4-inch touchscreen is available. The available Performance Pages allow driving modes to be selected merely by tapping the screen. Launch control is also available.

The long list of standard convenience features includes keyless entry with push-button start, dual-zone climate control, a USB port, and an auxiliary input jack. Then there are the abundant driver assistance and safety features: traction control, brake assist, and active front head restraints among them. The Journey AVP options packages bring more advanced connectivity as well as three-zone climate control and adaptable seating, all without driving the price too high. When compared with the more expensive compact crossovers, though, the Journey is behind the times with the standard powertrain. Not that the 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine isn’t up to snuff, but we look for a six-speed automatic instead of the four-speed automatic found here—especially because this rig weighs in at a thumping 3,818 pounds. (The V-6 with six-speed automatic and all-wheel drive weighs 4,238.)

The F12berlinetta is a design advance that integrates swooping forms with flat planes, sharp creases with gently rounded masses. Designers nowadays like to talk about the play of light on surfaces, but on the F12berlinetta the light frolics. As we said, though, it’s all in the service of aerodynamic efficiency. Deep indentations running along the hood and sweeping past the fenders and along the doors are the functional Aero Bridge, which contribute to the body’s low-drag and high-downforce as the car knifes along. <br> <br> A brisk pace is assured by the direct-injection 6.3-liter V-12 engine, which produces 731-horsepower. The car springs from 0 to 62 mph in 3.1 seconds and will hit 220 mph. (You can hear the V-12 scream thanks to a fun “start the engine” feature on Ferrari’s website.) Electronics govern the chassis dynamics and regulate the carbon-ceramic brakes. Inside the car, simple elegance prevails. Control buttons are integrated into the flat-bottom steering wheel, and instead of a shift lever, there are three transmission control buttons on a central “bridge.” A TFT screen within the instrument cluster shows infotainment functions. For storage, an upholstered rear bench has straps to secure luggage, or it folds flat for extra space. Our favorite optional feature is a passenger-side dashboard display showing gear position, engine RPM, and road speed. The world is running short of two-passenger, V-12-powered coupes these days. That the F12berlinetta is developed to such a high degree is reason to smile.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nNo new features.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ferrari F12berlinetta interior","fileMasterId":109248476,"fileName":"ferrari-F12berlinetta-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109248476/ferrari-F12berlinetta-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ferrari F12berlinetta","fileMasterId":109248500,"fileName":"ferrari-F12berlinetta-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109248500/ferrari-F12berlinetta-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ferrari F12berlinetta","fileMasterId":109248473,"fileName":"ferrari-F12berlinetta-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109248473/ferrari-F12berlinetta-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:36:57.121-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547817122 }} },{ "_id":680138,"title":"2015 Ferrari FF","subTitle":"Up f-f-for anything.","slug":"2015-ferrari-ff","promoTitle":"2015 Ferrari FF","promoTeaserSmall":"Up f-f-for anything.","promoTeaser":"Up f-f-for anything.","keywords":["2015 Ferrari FF"],"metaTitle":"2015 Ferrari FF","metaKeywords":["2015 Ferrari FF; Ferrari; hatchback; supercar; Italian"],"metaDescription":"Up f-f-for anything.

It claims to be the first V-12-powered car to have an electronically governed rear-axle differential and the first with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. The design allows the 6.3-liter V-12—and that’s a big chunk of aluminum—to sit behind the front axle, a layout that keeps the car from being nose-heavy and pushy in the turns. Ferrari’s clever, patented all-wheel-drive system is biased toward rear-drive until traction is compromised; then it dispenses torque to the front wheels. <br><br>With its station wagon-like shape, the FF seemed a weird departure when it was first presented in 2011, but now that Bentley is building an SUV and other high-end automakers are showing their expressions of utility, we understand the FF was ahead of the game. With all four seats in place, the 15.9-cubic-foot trunk holds four suitcases, two golf bags, or two strollers. But fold the rear seats fold flat, and this is a Ferrari that wants to go for landscaping supplies. An independently opening middle section enables the insertion of skis or a single golf bag with the seats in place. Persons as tall as 6 feet 1 inch will find the rear comfortable. There’s also abundant cabin storage for miscellaneous items. We would say “stuff,” but Ferrari owners don’t have stuff, they have items.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThere are no new features for 2015.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ferrari FF","fileMasterId":109262327,"fileName":"ferrari-FF-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109262327/ferrari-FF-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ferrari FF","fileMasterId":109262387,"fileName":"ferrari-FF-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109262387/ferrari-FF-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ferrari FF","fileMasterId":109262384,"fileName":"ferrari-FF-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109262384/ferrari-FF-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Ferrari FF</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/on-the-road/ferrari-ff-spa-and-drive/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Ferrari FF Spa-and-Drive</a> April 4, 2014","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:36:57.543-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547817544 }} },{ "_id":680162,"title":"2015 Bentley Mulsanne","subTitle":"The epitome of luxury.","slug":"2015-bentley-mulsanne","promoTitle":"2015 Bentley Mulsanne","promoTeaserSmall":"The epitome of luxury.","promoTeaser":"The epitome of luxury.","keywords":["2015 Bentley Mulsanne"],"metaTitle":"2015 Bentley Mulsanne","metaKeywords":["2015 Bentley Mulsanne; Bentley; sedan; British"],"metaDescription":"The epitome of luxury.

For the most part, they are correct, but why should the chauffeur be the only one to play with the 811 pound-feet of torque? The Mulsanne is the largest and most expensive of the Bentley lineup, and, yes, it is most often seen with a liveried driver wearing a chauffeur’s cap behind the wheel. Case in point: there is an optional champagne chiller tucked away within the rear center armrest that holds two champagne bottles and three bespoke crystal flutes. But it’s still a driver’s car, and its 6.75-liter engine can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds to outrun the paparazzi and boasts the most torque of any production gasoline-powered vehicle on the market. The Mulsanne caters to a limited audience, and it’s not just because of the $300,000 price. There are lots of ways to spend more than a quarter-million on a car, but few have the storied history, craftsmanship, attention to detail and scarcity implied in its badging.

Last year, it got the HondaVAC in-vehicle vacuum, enhanced safety equipment, and some connectivity upgrades. The Odyssey is a family car down to its DNA and it’s darn good at it. But this model has a sportier, more refined look than earlier years. So maybe you won’t cringe so much when you realize you need a minivan?\nAnd since families can be a major distraction while driving, the active safety technology in this car is a nice touch. Forward-collision alert, the blind-spot information system (which shows you what’s going on in your blind spot on screen using cameras in the side mirror), lane-departure warnings, and lots of air bags are a great idea when your daily cargo is your own family.\n\n<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nRefreshed in 2014.

With a variety of engines ranging from a turbocharged four-cylinder to a rip-roaring 550-horsepower supercharged V-8, there is an XF to suit the tastes of just about any luxury-car buyer. \n<br><br>\nThere are six trim levels in the XF lineup. The well-equipped 2.0T Premium, which is the least expensive XF, comes with more standard features than last year’s base model, including navigation, a rearview camera, and front park assist. There are two V-6 models, the luxurious Portfolio and the more aggressive Sport, which both come in at $58,170 and are the only two XFs available with all-wheel drive.  At the top of the model range sit the V-8-powered XFs: the 5.0 Supercharged, the XFR, and the XFR-S. All come with Jaguar’s 5.0-liter supercharged V-8, but it is tuned differently for each application. The V-8’s power output escalates from 470 hp in the 5.0 Supercharged to 510 hp in the XFR and tops out at 550 hp in the limited-production XFR-S, which can reach 60 mph in a blistering 4.4 seconds. \n<br><br>\nAll XFs have JaguarDrive Control, through which the driver can select a setting that adjusts the engine response, transmission shifts, and dynamic stability control intervention. There are three drive modes: Normal, for everyday driving; Dynamic, for a more sporting character; and Winter, which enhances handling in low-grip conditions. \n<br><br>\nNo matter the model, the XF comes with an interior that lives up to Jaguar’s reputation for luxury and craftsmanship, with French-stitched leather and a wide selection of veneers and color schemes. In addition, there is a touch of practicality: the rotary shift knob frees up space for storage up front, and the rear seat back splits 60/40 and can be folded down to carry long and or bulky items that won’t fit in the spacious 17.7-cubic-foot trunk.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nPortfolio and Sport versions; more standard features on Premium model; options, colors, and trims have been realigned.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Jaguar XF interior","fileMasterId":111176912,"fileName":"jaguar-xf-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111176912/jaguar-xf-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Jaguar XF","fileMasterId":91374169,"fileName":"jaguar-xf-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91374169/jaguar-xf-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Jaguar XF","fileMasterId":91374166,"fileName":"jaguar-xf-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91374166/jaguar-xf-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Jaguar XF</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/events/2016-jaguar-xf/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2016 Jaguar XF</a> April 1, 2015","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43167,"make":"Jaguar","model":"XF","year":2015},{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:37:01.823-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547821824 }} },{ "_id":686219,"title":"2015 Lexus CT200h","subTitle":"A sporty, upscale hybrid.","slug":"2015-lexus-ct200h","promoTitle":"2015 Lexus CT200h","promoTeaserSmall":"A sporty, upscale hybrid.","promoTeaser":"A sporty, upscale hybrid.","keywords":["2015 Lexus CT200h"],"metaTitle":"2015 Lexus CT200h","metaKeywords":["2015 Lexus CT200h; Lexus; hybrid; wagon; hatchback; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"A sporty, upscale hybrid.

As the name might lead one to expect, there’s a complement of standard and available safety and security features, including active front head restraints and a front sonar system. A power liftgate and power-fold third-row bench aid access to the rear. Among full-size SUVs, the Armada breaks out of the box with a sweeping roofline and sculpted sides creating a fuselage effect. The friendly face indicates strength and suggests the Armada is an alternative among full-size SUVs and may be the right choice.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nRevised interior trim, standard power-adjustable driver’s seat lumbar support, new 20-inch alloy wheels, and Arctic Metallic blue and Magnetic black paint.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Nissan Armada interior","fileMasterId":91976128,"fileName":"nissan-armada-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91976128/nissan-armada-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Nissan Armada","fileMasterId":91976122,"fileName":"nissan-armada-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91976122/nissan-armada-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45429,"make":"Nissan","model":"Armada","year":2015},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:37:03.817-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547823818 }} },{ "_id":687266,"title":"2015 Nissan Frontier","subTitle":"The everything midsize.","slug":"2015-nissan-frontier","promoTitle":"2015 Nissan Frontier","promoTeaserSmall":"The everything midsize.","promoTeaser":"The everything midsize.","keywords":["2015 Nissan Frontier"],"metaTitle":"2015 Nissan Frontier","metaKeywords":["2015 Nissan Frontier; Nissan; pickup; truck; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"The everything midsize.

On the other hand, the four-wheel-drive Desert Runner has a more capable suspension, aggressive-looking alloy wheels, and a trendy decal. The basic S comes with antilock brakes and forward-facing rear seats that flip up to provide interior cargo space. A 5-speed automatic transmission is available in place of the manual. The SV and Desert Runner are offered in King or Crew Cab, and the SL is Crew Cab only. The list of features and amenities grows longer as the truck itself does: The SL Crew Cab stretches to 219.4 in length and the price tag stretches close to $40,000 when options like the sunroof and various accessories are thrown in. (Among the latter, our favorite is the $260 bed tent, a nylon dome with a pole-supported awning that puts real “bedtime” into effect.

But it is an entity unto itself: streamlined, dramatic, and futuristic. While it combines style and luxury with a strong strain of sportiness, there’s also the functionality of a five-seat crossover utility vehicle with 69.9 cubic feet of cargo room. (The available power-folding rear seat is a nice feature.) Nissan’s smart all-wheel drive system is available with each trim level. A sufficiently powerful V-6 engine pairs up with a continuously variable automatic transmission that simulates a conventional gearbox’s shifting steps. And when it’s hitched to a 1500-pound utility trailer, the Murano might look like Goldilocks with a granny shopping cart, but it’ll do the job. Standard LED daytime running lights and “boomerang”-style tail lamps (originally introduced on Nissan 370Z) add flair. Inside, the experience is intended to be lounge-like, with an open center console making conversation easy between front and back rows.

It has a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and new continuously variable transmission, so fuel economy improves to 24 city mpg. Yet cargo capacity is impressive: 122.7 cubic feet. The cargo bay accepts a 40-by-48-inch pallet between the wheel wells, and a seven-foot-tall person could lie down in the cargo area (although he’d have to bend his neck a little to fit). The rear doors are split 60/40, with the smaller door opening to the traffic side of the street; both doors open to 180 degrees, resting flush against the van’s sides. The dual sliding side doors are solid for the company’s logo, but glass is available in all rear doors. Inside, standard cargo mounting points enable attachment of shelves, and six available floor-mounted cargo hooks help to keep things in place. Roof rack mounting points are standard. Inside, the driver will take advantage of Nissan’s “mobile office” center console, which stores a laptop or hanging file folders as well as the necessities one requires when spending long days in the vehicle. The front passenger seat slides 9.5 inches to extend cargo space, and the seat back folds flat to serve as a desk or picnic table.

It seats up to seven people with the available third-row bench, and the flexible interior layout provides up to 70.0 cubic feet of cargo space. Long pieces of cargo will fit, thanks to the flat-folding front seat folds flat. Wide-opening rear doors admit passengers to the back seats, the second row slides 9.0 inches and also reclines, and there are plenty of storage pockets. Comfort is a priority for front-seat occupants, as well, and the Rogue is available with advanced seat heaters that quickly warm the most strategic parts of the seat. The Rogue was all-new in 2014, and its advanced structural design leads to excellent safety ratings. It is available with a suite of contemporary driver assistance features, including 360-degree surround view, a class exclusive. Another point of pride is the excellent fuel economy. Under the hood, the 2.5-liter four-cylinder makes 170 horsepower, and paired with a continuously variable transmission—a competent and highly efficient powertrain. But because of the CVT, towing capacity is limited to just 1000 pounds. While being conventional in design, the Rogue is nicely detailed inside and out. Nissan still offers the previous-generation model as the Rogue Select S, a well-equipped value package that has an appealing $21,035 price tag (includes destination). \r\n \r\n<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nStandard satellite radio, NissanConnect with Mobile Apps connectivity, available Eco mode, heated cloth seats, new colors: Arctic Blue, Pearl White, Glacier White.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Nissan Rogue","fileMasterId":91978963,"fileName":"nissan-rogue-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91978963/nissan-rogue-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":2,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43258,"make":"Nissan","model":"Rogue","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45504,"make":"Nissan","model":"Rogue Select","year":2015},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:37:06.751-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547826751 }} },{ "_id":687283,"title":"2015 Nissan Sentra","subTitle":"Life on the upswing.","slug":"2015-nissan-sentra","promoTitle":"2015 Nissan Sentra","promoTeaserSmall":"Life on the upswing.","promoTeaser":"Life on the upswing.","keywords":["2015 Nissan Sentra"],"metaTitle":"2015 Nissan Sentra","metaKeywords":["2015 Nissan Sentra; Nissan; sedan; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"Life on the upswing.

As with other Nissan models, the body is aerodynamically efficient, and excellent fuel economy is the payoff, especially in the Sentra FE+ S, which incorporates underbody deflectors, a rear spoiler, and low rolling resistance tires to achieve 40 highway mpg. The 1.8-liter four-cylinder produces 130 horsepower, which is adequate if not exciting, and is paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable automatic. The Sentra SV is loaded with infotainment and convenience features and now offers a Style Package that includes a power-operated sunroof, unique 16-inch alloy wheels, and a rear spoiler. Heated front seats and heated side mirrors are available for buyers in less than toasty climes. The sporty Sentra SR shares those features, adds rear disc brakes and a smart key before offering available leather upholstery and a premium audio system. This is the seventh-generation Sentra.

The Xterra is maneuverable and offers great visibility. While it doesn’t corner too well on the highway, it will crawl over some impressive offroad obstacles.

Its platform was stretched, and both the passenger volume (99.7 cubic feet) and cargo capacity (14.8 cubic feet) increased, although the 6 remains slightly less spacious than most of its competitors. \n<br><br>\nDespite its larger size, the Mazda 6 exhibits the lively handling of a smaller car. Its 184-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder isn’t overly powerful, but it is responsive and returns excellent fuel economy—up to 40 mpg on the highway when paired with the automatic transmission and i-ELOOP, a regenerative braking system that converts the car’s kinetic energy to electricity when the driver lets up on the accelerator. The engine can be paired with either a six-speed automatic transmission or a six-speed manual. The downside of this sportier handling is that the Mazda 6’s ride isn’t quite as plush as that of some of its competitors, but we think the compromise is worth it.\n<br><br>\nEven the base (Sport) model comes well equipped, with seventeen-inch wheels, a tilt-and-telescope steering wheel, cruise control, and power accessories. Moving up to the Touring model gets nineteen-inch wheels, blind spot monitoring, dual-zone climate control, and premium upholstery, among other amenities. The Grand Touring gets all of the above plus unique nineteen-inch wheels, leather, an eight-way heated power driver’s seat with lumbar adjustment, and LED running lights. In any iteration, the Mazda 6 is worth a look if you value performance, fuel economy, and a wide selection of convenience features.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nNew paint color (Deep Crystal Blue), power windows with one-touch auto up/down, advanced keyless entry on Touring model, and some minor option package changes.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda 6 interior","fileMasterId":114977102,"fileName":"mazda-6-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/114977102/mazda-6-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda 6","fileMasterId":114977063,"fileName":"mazda-6-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/114977063/mazda-6-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda 6","fileMasterId":114977036,"fileName":"mazda-6-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/114977036/mazda-6-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43767,"make":"Mazda","model":"MAZDA6","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:37:12.412-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547832413 }} },{ "_id":687689,"title":"Requiem for a 1991 Volvo 740","subTitle":"A fond farewell to Nigel, a real brick of a car.","slug":"requiem-for-a-1991-volvo-740","promoTitle":"Requiem for a 1991 Volvo 740","promoTeaserSmall":"A fond farewell to Nigel, a real brick of a car.","promoTeaser":"A fond farewell to Nigel, a real brick of a car.","keywords":["Requiem for a 1991 Volvo 740"],"metaTitle":"Requiem for a 1991 Volvo 740 - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["1991 Volvo 740","Volvo 740","Volvo","vintage cars","old cars","car disposal","used cars"],"metaDescription":"A fond farewell to Nigel, a real brick of a car.","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2015-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2015-05-14T06:35:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2015-05-14T06:35:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":false,"url":"/car-life/on-the-road/requiem-for-a-1991-volvo-740/","canBeGallery":false,"contributors":[{"id":17224,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Elaine Nadalin","firstName":"Elaine","lastName":"Nadalin","jobTitle":"Contributor","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"I am a car geek dating back to my childhood, when I took notice of the various sizes, shapes, and designs of cars.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

In the SE, Sport, and Limited, expect the 2.4-liter four-cylinder. The Eco has its own 1.6-liter four-cylinder and returns excellent fuel economy. Turbocharging makes the 2.0-liter four-cylinder something of a beast in the Sport 2.0T and Limited 2.0T. And the Hybrid models have a unique 2.4-liter four-cylinder that’s coupled with an electric drive system and lithium-ion battery pack. <br><br>Each model is carefully distinguished from the others. The Sonata Sport, for instance, has a blacked-out grille, flared rocker panels with integrated chrome moldings, and seventeen-inch alloy wheels. The Sport 2.0T and Limited 2.0T wear eighteen-inch alloy wheels and say good-bye through quad exhaust tips. Designers found a distinct look for the Hybrid, with a chrome bar above the black grille; low-drag wheel covers visually represent efficiency. Feature content is generously doled out. Available smart cruise control exemplifies the breadth of active safety measures, while infotainment keeps up to speed with an eight-inch touchscreen to access downloadable apps.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

This year, improvements to the electrically assisted power steering along with a slightly stiffened suspension enhance the Santa Fe’s drivability. Front- or available all-wheel drive with 5-, 6-, or 7-passenger, three-row configuration are the choices for this crossover. Electronic chassis controls include selectable steering effort, now with a firmer Sport setting, and a smart all-wheel-drive system with active cornering control. The 6-passenger setup has two captain’s chairs instead of the standard 40/20/40 split-folding and reclining middle-row bench; this setup is only offered as part of the Ultimate package, available with either GLS or Limited trim. The Premium package for the Santa Fe GLS adds such conveniences and luxuries as Proximity Key entry with pushbutton start, leather upholstery, and the hands-free power liftgate. Navigation and a heated steering wheel and rear seats, as well as cooled front seats, are included in the GLS Ultimate package. The Limited Ultimate throws in HID headlamps, LED tail lamps, and a killer 12-speaker audio system. Under the hood in all trim levels is the direct-injection 3.3-liter V-6 that produces 290 horsepower. Clamp on a trailer hitch, and the Santa Fe will tow up to 5,000 pounds. Hill start assist and downhill brake control help to manage the load. Stability and traction control are standard. Lane change assist and blind spot detection with rear cross-traffic alert are available, along with rear parking assist. Like every other Hyundai, the Santa Fe has a high surprise and delight factor, delivers great performance, and represents a good value. \n<h3>\nNew for 2015</h3>\nRefined steering and suspension systems, daytime running lights, driver’s blind spot mirror, auto up/down front passenger power window, available hands-free power-operated liftgate, Sparkling Silver and Platinum Graphite added to list of available paint colors.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Hyundai Santa Fe","fileMasterId":119630642,"fileName":"hyundai-santafe-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119630642/hyundai-santafe-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Hyundai Santa Fe","fileMasterId":119630639,"fileName":"hyundai-santafe-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119630639/hyundai-santafe-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":2,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45731,"make":"Hyundai","model":"Santa Fe","year":2015},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:37:33.076-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547853077 }} },{ "_id":689252,"title":"2015 Acura RLX","subTitle":"High-tech luxury.","slug":"2015-acura-rlx","promoTitle":"2015 Acura RLX","promoTeaserSmall":"High-tech luxury.","promoTeaser":"High-tech luxury.","keywords":["2015 Acura RLX"],"metaTitle":"2015 Acura RLX","metaKeywords":["2015 Acura RLX; Acura; sedan; luxury; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"High-tech luxury.

However, that hasn’t discouraged Honda’s upscale division, which continues to add features to the RLX to elevate its level of technology and sophistication. There are four trim levels/packages—Navigation, Technology, Advance, and Krell Audio—and one powertrain, a 310-horsepower V-6 mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. There is also a Sport Hybrid version, but it is not technically a 2015 model. It continues to be sold in dealerships, but since it came out late in the 2014 model year, it continues with that designation. The hybrid powertrain produces 377 horsepower and gets 30 mpg in combined city/highway driving. A redesigned Sport Hybrid with all-wheel drive is scheduled to go on sale for 2016.\n<br><br>\nThe RLX doesn’t carry the prestige of its European competitors, nor does it have their wider selection of powertrains. Driving the RLX is not a revelation, either, but its V-6 engine powerful enough, and it delivers a smooth ride. Where the RLX excels is with its spacious interior, which has generous legroom for back-seat passengers and features a wide array of high-tech features. Forward-collision and lane-departure warning systems and a multi-view rear camera are standard, and a collision mitigation braking system and lane-keeping assist are available. Also available with the Advance package is an adaptive cruise control system with low-speed follow, which automatically slows the car without any input from the driver when traffic necessitates braking.

There are two available powertrains, a four-cylinder with an eight-speed automatic transmission and a V-6 with a nine-speed auto. All-wheel steering is standard with front-wheel drive models, and all-wheel drive is optional with the V-6 engine. The base TLX comes well equipped, with heated seats and side mirrors, a power moonroof, satellite radio, and LED head- and taillights. For even more features, such as navigation with 3D view and HD Radio, you can upgrade to the Technology and Advance packages\n<br><br>\nSlightly smaller than the TL, the TLX is built on an all-new platform, and the body is made of rigid, lightweight materials that emphasize driving dynamics and collision safety. In addition, wind, road, and engine noise have been reduced compared with the TL, thanks to triple door seals and extra body sealing and sound-absorbing materials. All TLXs also feature Acura’s Integrated Dynamics System (IDS), which offers four modes – Econ, Normal, Sport, and Sport+ — for drivers to adjust steering firmness, throttle response, and shifting patterns.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"\r\n<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe TLX is an all-new model for 2015.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Acura TLX","fileMasterId":119694374,"fileName":"acura-TLX-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119694374/acura-TLX-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Acura TLX","fileMasterId":119694332,"fileName":"acura-TLX-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119694332/acura-TLX-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Acura TLX","fileMasterId":119694371,"fileName":"acura-TLX-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119694371/acura-TLX-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Acura TLX</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround/acura-tsx-prototype/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Designer Walkaround Video: Acura TLX Prototype</a> March 17, 2014, with Jean Jennings","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":40648,"make":"Acura","model":"TLX","year":2015},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":7},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:37:35.471-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547855471 }} },{ "_id":689455,"title":"Lunch with the Gurney Racing Family","subTitle":"Any day spent with Dan Gurney and his family at All American Racers is a good day.","slug":"lunch-with-the-gurney-racing-family","promoTitle":"Lunch with the Gurney Racing Family","promoTeaserSmall":"Any day spent with Dan Gurney and his family at All American Racers is a good day.","promoTeaser":"Any day spent with Dan Gurney and his family at All American Racers is a good day.","keywords":["Lunch with the Gurney Racing Family"],"metaTitle":"Lunch with the Gurney Racing Family - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Dan Gurney","All American Racers","Evi Gurney","Eagle-Weslake","Eagle Formula 1","Grand Prix racing","Belgian Grand Prix","Justin Gurney","Alex Gurney"],"metaDescription":"Any day spent with Dan Gurney and his family at All American Racers is a good day.","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2015-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2015-06-02T12:10:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2015-06-01T12:10:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":false,"url":"/life-with-jean/the-road-trips/lunch-with-the-gurney-racing-family/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

All this is to say that with its much-lauded dynamics, comfort, and performance, BMW has set the benchmark for performance sedans, and every manufacturer has it in its crosshairs. But beating BMW at its own game will be tough, since buyers can basically configure their 3 Series any way they like it. Shoppers can choose the sedan, wagon, or long wheel base hatchback, select either the standard rear-wheel drive or xDrive, choose a manual or automatic transmission, and pick from six engine options including a diesel and a hybrid, or go with the M3. You will pay dearly for all of these models, and that’s before you add your driver assistance and comfort packages, like navigation, a color head-up display, app integration, heated front and rear seats and steering wheel, a rearview camera, or adaptive headlights. But with its premium price come premium finishes. The interior is decidedly refined and spacious; the Luxury, Sport, and M Sport trim lines set different style tones; and a host of optional packages can make it one of the most technically advanced sedans out there. But any way it’s kitted out, it remains an attainable daily driver that has the versatility to switch instantly to a track car with a few setting changes.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nRevised package features, new leather and material options, Comfort Access now includes the hands-free trunk closing function, and the M3 model is all new.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 3-series interior","fileMasterId":124060781,"fileName":"BMW-3series-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124060781/BMW-3series-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 3-series","fileMasterId":124060874,"fileName":"BMW-3series-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124060874/BMW-3series-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 3-series","fileMasterId":124060775,"fileName":"BMW-3series-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124060775/BMW-3series-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 3-series","fileMasterId":124060772,"fileName":"BMW-3series-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124060772/BMW-3series-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":42790,"make":"BMW","model":"3-Series","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":39787,"make":"BMW","model":"M3","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45869,"make":"BMW","model":"ActiveHybrid 3","year":2015},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:37:41.248-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547861249 }} },{ "_id":690789,"title":"2015 BMW 7 Series","subTitle":"Stately sedan.","slug":"2015-bmw-7-series","promoTitle":"2015 BMW 7 Series","promoTeaserSmall":"Stately sedan.","promoTeaser":"Stately sedan.","keywords":["2015 BMW 7 Series"],"metaTitle":"2015 BMW 7 Series","metaKeywords":["2015 BMW 7-series; BMW; sedan; hybrid; diesel; Alpina B7; German"],"metaDescription":"Stately sedan.

That's all good news for anyone who wants a safer car.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"App","caption":"","fileMasterId":125472872,"fileName":"app.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/125472872/app.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"But back to the smartwatch.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-06-26T06:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevy-cruze-promolarge","title":"Chevy Cruze Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/126179948/chevy-cruze-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":126179948,"fileName":"chevy-cruze-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-06-26T06:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevy-cruze-promolarge","title":"Chevy Cruze Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/126179948/chevy-cruze-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":126179948,"fileName":"chevy-cruze-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-06-26T06:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevy-cruze-promolarge","title":"Chevy Cruze Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/126179948/chevy-cruze-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":126179948,"fileName":"chevy-cruze-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":955972,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>The 2016 Chevrolet Cruze will not be in showrooms until early 2016,</strong> but, like the plethora of presidential candidates we're already seeing, it has hit the campaign trail a little bit early.

That’s one of the quickest in the industry but the true test of any luxury convertible is whether or not the trunk can still hold a set of golf clubs with the top stowed, and the SL-Class passes with flying colors—it can hold two sets.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Attractive, sharp, and responsive, the CX-3 brings together classic Mazda handling and consumer-demanded space. You can take on twisting roads with full control and style while lugging camping supplies, new furniture, or friends and family. There is only one choice of engine – a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 146 horsepower – and one transmission – six-speed automatic with paddle shifters. Don’t let the limited engine and transmission options get you down, though. The CX-3 comes with a whole slew of notable standard features, including LED lighting, power moonroof, leather seats with suede inserts, and best of all, navigation. The options aren’t quite as exciting. When searching for the best of both worlds in style and practicality, people now turn to the compact crossover. And thanks to its high-quality features and sharp design, the CX-3 will top the compact crossover list.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>New for 2016:</strong> <br>\nThe CX-3 is a new model.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>More about the 2016 Mazda CX-3</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/2016-mazda-cx-3/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Review: 2016 Mazda CX-3</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda CX-3","fileMasterId":146423876,"fileName":"mazda-cx-3-2016-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146423876/mazda-cx-3-2016-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda CX-3","fileMasterId":146423873,"fileName":"mazda-cx-3-2016-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146423873/mazda-cx-3-2016-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda CX-3","fileMasterId":146423948,"fileName":"mazda-cx-3-2016-07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146423948/mazda-cx-3-2016-07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda CX-3","fileMasterId":146423939,"fileName":"mazda-cx-3-2016-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146423939/mazda-cx-3-2016-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda CX-3","fileMasterId":146423870,"fileName":"mazda-cx-3-2016-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146423870/mazda-cx-3-2016-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda CX-3","fileMasterId":146423954,"fileName":"mazda-cx-3-2016-header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146423954/mazda-cx-3-2016-header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda CX-3","fileMasterId":146423951,"fileName":"mazda-cx-3-2016-08.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146423951/mazda-cx-3-2016-08.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda CX-3","fileMasterId":146423942,"fileName":"mazda-cx-3-2016-05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146423942/mazda-cx-3-2016-05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda CX-3","fileMasterId":146423945,"fileName":"mazda-cx-3-2016-06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146423945/mazda-cx-3-2016-06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":8,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":44004,"make":"Mazda","model":"CX-3","year":2016},{"id":"71d39f07-0bc5-39bd-9468-12085dc13b7c","type":"mediaTag","name":"First_Car","path":"/Main/First_Car"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:38:03.433-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547883435 }} },{ "_id":695037,"title":"2016 Honda Accord Sport","subTitle":"The mid-size gold standard is new and improved, with a better look and more safety technology.","slug":"2016-honda-accord-sport","promoTitle":"2016 Honda Accord Sport","promoTeaserSmall":"The mid-size gold standard is new and improved, with a better look and more safety technology.","promoTeaser":"The mid-size gold standard is new and improved, with a better look and more safety technology.","keywords":["2016 Honda Accord Sport"],"metaTitle":"2016 Honda Accord Sport -

Honda Odyssey has been the choice for years of people with large families and a taste for comfort. For 2016, Honda has added a new Special Edition model that brings some of the highest-end amenities down to a more affordable price point. Among them are the vaunted HondaVAC in-vehicle vacuum cleaner and a rear-seat entertainment system. You'll find that, with so many trim levels (eight!), you won't be scratching your head checking out an à la carte options list. Instead, move to the EX-L model and up to get a leather-wrapped steering wheel and seats, heated front seats, a power moonroof that tilts, and best of all, a power tailgate. Forward collision warning, lane departure warning, and Honda's unequaled multi-angle rearview camera with guidelines come with the EX-L and up, too. All but the base LX seat up to eight, with five car seat anchors—with the idea that you have flexibility, not that you'll be carrying five kids in car seats! But, even if you are, this is one vehicle that can handle it. It also tows up to 3,500 pounds and has a full 172.6 cubic feet inside, so you get it all: as much luxury as you want in your minivan, plus a whole lot of capability.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>New for 2016:</strong>\r\nNew \"high value\" Special Edition (SE) model with rear-seat entertainment, SiriusXM satellite radio, and HondaVAC vacuum cleaner.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541270,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-08.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541270/honda-odyssey-2016-08.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541138,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541138/honda-odyssey-2016-05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541273,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541273/honda-odyssey-2016-header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541132,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541132/honda-odyssey-2016-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541261,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541261/honda-odyssey-2016-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541141,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541141/honda-odyssey-2016-07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541135,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541135/honda-odyssey-2016-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541258,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541258/honda-odyssey-2016-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":46311,"make":"Honda","model":"Odyssey","year":2016},{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:38:07.501-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547887502 }} },{ "_id":695352,"title":"5 Common Spills You Can Clean Yourself","subTitle":"Get out the common household products to make headway with these unpleasant car-upholstery messes.","slug":"5-common-spills-you-can-clean-yourself","promoTitle":"5 Common Spills You Can Clean Yourself","promoTeaserSmall":"Get out the common household products to make headway with these unpleasant car-upholstery messes.","promoTeaser":"Get out the common household products to make headway with these unpleasant car-upholstery messes.","keywords":["5 Common Spills You Can Clean Yourself"],"metaTitle":"5 Common Spills and How to Clean Them -

The Equus is Hyundai’s luxury sedan, and it boasts many of the features you would expect from a high-end sedan – like power seats, wood accents, sunroof – without the close-to-six-figure price tag. It is powered by a 5.0-liter V-8 that produces 429 horsepower, and the engine hooks up to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Although the standard features make up a long enough list to satisfy the queen of England, there is an optional Ultimate package, too. It includes cooled rear seats, forward-view cornering camera, and head-up display.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-11T12:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-ia-promolarge","title":"Scion Ia Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/143363843/scion-ia-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":143363843,"fileName":"scion-ia-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-11T12:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-ia-promolarge","title":"Scion Ia Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/143363843/scion-ia-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":143363843,"fileName":"scion-ia-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-11T12:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-ia-header","title":"Scion Ia Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/143363915/scion-ia-header.jpg","fileMasterId":143363915,"fileName":"scion-ia-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1624},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2553}}},"pages":[{"id":964588,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BxjkYK-ZkOA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, front-wheel-drive subcompact sedan<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $16,495 (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $18,184<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 1.5-liter four-cylinder, 106 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed manual <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 31 mpg city/41 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> Not yet rated by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS)<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Rearview camera<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Navigation system ($419), door-sill protectors ($170)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> 2016 Chevrolet Sonic LS Manual ($15,170);

This power is kept neatly beneath Buick’s classic design and elegance, though. Luxury remains a selling point as standard features include dual-zone automatic climate control, eight-way power driver’s seat, and push-button start. Options take this luxury a bit further, providing a heated, leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated and leather-appointed seating, and  a rearview camera. For 2016, Buick has updated its Driver Confidence package and moved from six-way power driver’s seat to eight-way. The infotainment also received a make-over with a touchscreen now available and IntelliLink stepping up its game. Like the other 2016 Buick models, new exterior colors have been added.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>New for 2016:</strong> Driver Confidence package, Eight-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, Available 7-inch-diagonal Color Touch radio with Buick IntelliLink, OnStar with 4G LTE and standard built-in Wi-Fi hotspot, New exterior colors: Crystal Red Tintcoat, Ebony Twilight Metallic and Graphite Gray Metallic","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Buick Verano Turbo","fileMasterId":146350013,"fileName":"buick-verano-turbo-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146350013/buick-verano-turbo-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Buick Verano Turbo","fileMasterId":146350010,"fileName":"buick-verano-turbo-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146350010/buick-verano-turbo-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Buick Verano Turbo","fileMasterId":146350079,"fileName":"buick-verano-turbo-header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146350079/buick-verano-turbo-header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Buick Verano Turbo","fileMasterId":146350016,"fileName":"buick-verano-turbo-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146350016/buick-verano-turbo-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Buick Verano","fileMasterId":146350007,"fileName":"buick-verano-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146350007/buick-verano-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":46654,"make":"Buick","model":"Verano","year":2016},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":true,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:38:14.773-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547894774 }} },{ "_id":698026,"title":"2016 Cadillac CTS and CTS-V","subTitle":"New engine, new technology for the performance-oriented sedan.","slug":"2016-cadillac-cts-and-cts-v","promoTitle":"2016 Cadillac CTS and CTS-V","promoTeaserSmall":"New engine, new technology for the performance-oriented sedan.","promoTeaser":"New engine, new technology for the performance-oriented sedan.","keywords":["2016 Cadillac CTS and CTS-V"],"metaTitle":"2016 Cadillac CTS and CTS-V -

Cadillac Escalade and its extended-length sibling, the Escalade ESV, came out in a stylish all new version for 2015, setting a high bar for the brand and other full-size SUVs in the class. Available in either a seven- or eight-seat configuration, the Escalade is a big utility vehicle that is also big on performance (0 to 60 mph in less than six seconds) and impressive good looks. Look at that brushed chrome grille and the extensive use of LED lighting in back, for example. It’s equally capable off-road and is capable of towing up to 8,300 pounds. Inside, the cabin is appropriately hushed thanks to the use of acoustic-laminate glass, triple-sealed doors, and active noise-canceling technology.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Jean","firstName":"Molly","lastName":"Jean","jobTitle":"Senior Editor","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"When I turned sixteen, my dad brought home the very first-generation Ford Escort wagon, and it just so happened to have a manual transmission. Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Teenagers","id":1034773,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/kids-in-the-car/teenagers","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Kids in the Car","id":1034769,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-18T20:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-homepage","title":"Insurance Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/154203842/insurance-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":154203842,"fileName":"insurance-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-18T20:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-homepage","title":"Insurance Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/154203842/insurance-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":154203842,"fileName":"insurance-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-18T20:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-header","title":"Insurance Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/154203833/insurance-header.jpg","fileMasterId":154203833,"fileName":"insurance-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":966797,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"School is in session. Yes, for your kids, but also for you. This lesson is for parents of young drivers. The cost of adding your child to your auto insurance policy can certainly dampen the excitement of the milestone of earning a driver’s license. We may not be as money savvy as Suze Orman, but we do have some tips to save some greenbacks on your insurance. The time to do your insurance homework is well before your child drives away from the DMV with his or her license. I personally was not so smart. The day my daughter was added to our auto insurance policy, our premium nearly doubled. So you should do as I say, not what I did.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>1. Start early.</strong> When your student starts driver ed, begin exploring insurance for your young driver. Compile a list of questions to ask potential insurance companies. Get quotes from at least three suitors. It makes sense to begin with your current insurance company and see what programs they offer for young drivers. But be prepared to walk if another company can save you money.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>2. Learn about good-student discounts.</strong> All of the nagging to get your kid to get good grades will not only get them into a good college, it may help to beef up their college fund at the same time. Just as an example, a co-worker gets $294.41 knocked off the State Farm premium on her college student’s car every six months because of a good-student discount. There are good statistical reasons why new drivers pay high premiums, but many companies let you reduce that a bit with a financial incentive for a good grade-point average. This usually applies to both high school and college students, including homeschoolers, but make sure to confirm. Each company has its own age restrictions—State Farm grants the discount until the twenty-fifth birthday, even after a student has earned a degree. Ask what magic GPA number is required to get (and maintain) the discount.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"AAA, State Farm, and Liberty Mutual all offer some kind of “away” discount; all require the student’s school address to be at least 100 miles from home.","type":"blockquote"},{"order":4,"text":"<strong>3.

Again, each company treats this discount differently, but AAA, State Farm, and Liberty Mutual all offer some kind of “away” discount; all require the student’s school address to be at least 100 miles from home. Check the age restrictions and find out if there are driving limitations when they are home. State Farm allows the student to drive the family car during breaks, including summer. AAA assured us that the student is still covered when driving a friend’s car at school, as well as when he or she is a passenger or a pedestrian.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<strong>4. Do the math before your child takes a car to college.</strong> Don’t miss exploring the financial implications of having your child take a car to college. You must inform your insurance company of the new address of the student. The premium may increase based on the location. Also, find out the coverage if friends drive the car. My daughter does not have a car at school, but she drives friends' cars. I often wonder if her friends' parents know they are providing a car to a bevy of young drivers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<strong>5. Double check (and double back to check) your work.</strong> As your young driver progresses from age sixteen to twenty-five, remember to check back in with your company to see if any new programs apply to you. If your student was not eligible for the good-student discount when your coverage began but brings home a stellar report card later, or if he or she transfers to a college farther from home, make sure to let your company know. Most companies will not allow both the student away discount and good-student discount, so you may need to compare.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<strong>6.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Jean","firstName":"Molly","lastName":"Jean","jobTitle":"Senior Editor","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"When I turned sixteen, my dad brought home the very first-generation Ford Escort wagon, and it just so happened to have a manual transmission. Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-30T15:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"kia-sedona-homepage","title":"Kia Sedona Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/157338488/kia-sedona-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":157338488,"fileName":"kia-sedona-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-30T15:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"kia-sedona-homepage","title":"Kia Sedona Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/157338488/kia-sedona-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":157338488,"fileName":"kia-sedona-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-30T15:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"kia-sedona-header","title":"Kia Sedona Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/157338485/kia-sedona-header.jpg","fileMasterId":157338485,"fileName":"kia-sedona-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":972381,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Kia Sedona 02","caption":"","fileMasterId":157338482,"fileName":"kia-sedona-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/157338482/kia-sedona-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>Kia has a plan to help its Sedona thrive even as overall minivan sales continue to decline, faced with American's love affair with the sport-utility vehicle.</strong> It starts with the business-class comfort we found in the 2016 Kia Sedona SXL, the top-of-the-line model from Kia ($44,690 as tested, including destination charge).

Reclining seats.</strong> I spent some time over the long weekend lounging in the First Class Lounge Seating in the Sedona's second row, and I have never been as comfortable on a road trip before. Yes, I drove, too, but I was jonesing for the fully reclining center row captain's chairs the entire time. The seats are only found on the top SXL trim level. A leg rest flips out, fully supporting your legs, and the seat reclines waaaaay back. To afford more space for your legs to fully extend, the entire seat slides back and forth as well as from side to side. I brought along an eyeshade to get maximum comfort, but the SXL comes standard with built-in second- and third-row pull-down sunshades. One caveat: the lounge seats cannot have seat heating or cooling. Also, Kia has a disclaimer that traveling while fully reclined will compromise the effectiveness of the restraint system. So this might give pause to parents.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Kia Sedona 04","caption":"","fileMasterId":157338449,"fileName":"kia-sedona-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/157338449/kia-sedona-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":4,"text":"Warning to parents of large families who need to seat eight: you will have to forfeit the fully reclining second-row seats and go down a trim level to the SX.

I personally would consider sending that eighth passenger to boarding school so I could keep the lounge seating. For those who draw the short straw and end up in the third row, it reclines slightly as well. It is split 60/40 and can be stowed in the floor. When storing the second row, the lounge seats take up a large amount of space compared with the standard seats,  which slide forward and fold against the front seats.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"It also must be stated that the comfort level is definitely hampered by a rough ride, and to compete with the likes of Toyota and Honda, Kia needs to revisit the suspension before the 2017 models are on sale.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Kia Sedona Illumination","caption":"","fileMasterId":157338494,"fileName":"kia-sedona-illumination.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/157338494/kia-sedona-illumination.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":6,"text":"<strong>2.

The auxiliary port also has the guiding red glow. Adding to the electric powerplant on wheels is the standard power plug along with two 115-volt power outlets, one in the center console and another in the cargo area. Who doesn’t want to straighten their hair while flying down the highway? The USB that was positioned behind the front console won praise from the second-row recliners and added to their business class experience.

Yes, the lane departure warning audible alert is annoying, but it could also be a life saver. A minivan is the go-to vehicle for long road trips. And on road trips, drivers often remain behind the wheel for longer hours than common sense suggests is safe. Having your vehicle helicopter-mom your lane keeping is a really useful safety feature. When I was teaching my daughter to drive, reminding her to stay centered in her lane caused enough friction to set a forest on fire. The lane departure warning would have been a godsend. Then it would have been the car nannying her rather than me.
