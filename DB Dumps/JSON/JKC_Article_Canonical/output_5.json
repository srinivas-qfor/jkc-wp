I really don't. The freedom of getting behind the wheel of a car and just taking off can't be compared with anything else. You really feel that you’re in charge: in charge of the car, in charge of the road, and in charge of your life. Why on earth would you want someone else to drive you around when you could do it yourself? It’s so liberating! Obviously, I love driving. I suppose that isn't a particularly original statement for a Detroit native, but it's true. I was a little late getting my driver's license because of that pesky parallel parking, but once I got it, nothing could stop me. It doesn't matter if I have to chauffeur my grandmother to the bank less than a block from our house or drive across town. If I have my green Chrysler LHS--affectionately christened \"Betsy\" by my mother--and some gas in the tank, and if I am somehow able to avoid getting pulled over for driving just a little too fast, I'm good to go.\n\nSince I graduated from the University of Michigan, in April 2012, Betsy has taken me everywhere. She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn’t as dry as a piece of chalk…And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there. Not only am I a bibliophile, but I’m also a self-proclaimed Anglophile who loves Shakespeare and Elizabethan verse and one day plans to see the Houses of Parliament, visit the Tower of London, and, perhaps most important, eat real fish and chips. If only I could drive Betsy \"across the pond…\"","fileMasterId":39801611,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801611/39801611.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Soapbox","id":1034787,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/soapbox","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-25T11:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Bench Seats","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44450310/Impala-300-x-169.jpg","fileMasterId":44450310,"fileName":"Impala-300-x-169.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-25T11:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Bench Seats","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44450316/Old-Red-Bench-Seat.jpg","fileMasterId":44450316,"fileName":"Old-Red-Bench-Seat.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":620}}},"pages":[{"id":242442,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"You can still see the USA in your Chevrolet, but not from the front bench of your sedan for much longer.

He’s thrilled. I’m stunned. I’ve spent a good portion of the past sixteen years buckling Cole and his younger sister, Ava, into car seats, booster seats, and backseats to keep them from dying in car accidents. And, according to AAA, car crashes are the leading cause of death for teenagers. Still, he passed the test, and the state says he is ready to drive alone. But he and I are in a standoff. He has his hand out expecting me to drop the keys into it. But relinquishing those keys goes against every one of my maternal instincts. As we circle each other, I know that I can’t make him stop racing headlong toward adulthood. I have to let go of these keys so he can learn this one last lesson from me on the road to adulthood. But here are five things I did first and that I suggest you do, too.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h4>1.\tAlways ride shotgun.</h4>\nFor the past year, Cole has been driving with a permit, and I’ve handed him the keys every time we got in the car. I’ve made him drive in every circumstance – poor weather, freeways, at night. Sometimes I drag him away from his computer for a run to the store just so he can drive. I know he will never be as careful or attentive as he is when I’m in the car, but I wanted to build up some muscle memory of not-reckless driving. And I have no intention of stopping. I’ll keep right on riding shotgun for as long as possible – even if that means dragging myself away from a comfy chair just for a ride along.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h4>2.\tHave his or her vision checked.</h4>\nWhile Cole was driving at night a few months ago, it became clear to me that Cole couldn’t see street signs in the distance as well as I could. He had passed a vision exam during a physical but -- after relentless pestering from me – admitted that he has trouble seeing the details in movies or on blackboards if he sits in the back. A trip to the ophthalmologist confirmed that glasses would help his distance vision, especially at night. Vanity does not trump safety. And when he saw how hot he looked in the glasses, he agreed.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>3.\tLook into defensive driving courses.</h4>\nThe research is mixed on whether defensive driving schools that let teens test the limits of their attention, speed, and conditions on a closed track are a good idea. The experience gives some a taste for speed. But I sent mine to the B.R.A.K.E.S. (Be Responsible and Keep Everyone Safe) defensive driving school, which is a nonprofit program run by National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) drag racing star Doug Herbert, who lost both of his sons to a freeway car accident.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<br>I know Cole. He often listens more seriously to an adult expert who isn’t me or his dad, and I knew Herbert’s real-world tragedy would help him understand why I was being such a drag. Sure enough, he came home from that school humbled and more aware of the limits of his skills and the dangers of the road. He even lectured his sister on the dangers of texting and driving.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"But I leave nothing to chance. I also asked Cole to watch the heart-wrenching documentary<em> The Last Text,</em> in which friends and family share the last text their teen sent before dying in or causing an accident. I asked him to install an app on his phone that stops him from texting and driving, but I think it’s best to use a carrier-implemented one. Doing so would ensure that he would be unable to uninstall it, and I’m sure the arrival of a girlfriend on his social scene would provide just enough temptation to try to uninstall any app that comes between them.\nThe downside to this (for me, at least) is that our service provider doesn’t sell an app like this. As soon as our cell carrier makes this a feature, I will subscribe.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h4>4.\tMake him sign on the dotted line…in blood!</h4>\nMy son’s hand, held out hoping for the keys, is a unique opportunity for me. At this moment, he will do anything to get that car. So I made him sign an agreement detailing my rules for driving. I actually used the rules on AAA’s site <a href=\"http://teendriving.aaa.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Keys2Drive,</a> which offers lots of advice for parents and teens on driving, because it was easier – and the rulers were more thorough – than anything I would have come up with. (You can download an agreement customized for your state here.) We read it through together and signed it before I let those keys drop from my fist to his.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h4>5.\tEnforce the rules and embrace curfews!</h4>\nThere are quite a few things to think about when your teen gets behind the wheel of a car. When teen drivers have teen passengers, the rate of car accidents increases exponentially. The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety says accident risk goes up 44 percent if a sixteen- or seventeen-year-old driver has just one person under twenty-one riding with him or her. This is why Cole’s provisional license limits passengers. Not surprisingly, driving at night is also hazardous. (Yeah, I know it’s not like he’s driving to school, work, or the library at that hour, but it’s dangerous just the same.) Using a cell phone is banned by good sense, me, and the state. And then there is the list of rules detailed in our AAA agreement. Also, many of his friends drive and I don’t want him to contribute to the staggering statistics about teen passengers who die when teens are driving.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n<br>\n<br>\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n<br>\n<br>\nI have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism. I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n<br>\n<br>\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to.\n<br>\n<br>\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

He belonged to some commune of hippie candle makers, who sold him to me for $100. His name was Odin, and he lived to father two large litters with golden number two, Barley. At one time, I lived with five goldens. That’s when I made the rule that I couldn’t have more dogs than limbs. Every death broke my heart in pieces, so I gave up on dogs for ten years. Eight weeks after I met Tim Jennings, I bought him a Chesapeake Bay retriever for his birthday. We found out later that the dog had been born the day we met. As I drove that little guy to Tim’s house, it suddenly occurred to me that I was about to live with dogs again. We named him Ronald Ambert Wilkins, after a friend of ours who died of cancer. RonDog was our first, but not our last.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"More about Jean","caption":"","fileMasterId":45262380,"fileName":"Bob.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45262380/Bob.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":3264},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2448}},"order":3,"text":"<h2>GCH Irish’s Robert Garcia de Padua (Bob)</h2>\nI don’t mean to brag, but I come from a mighty line of champion Chessies from the Irish kennels in Michigan.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Many hybrids use regenerative braking technology to capture energy from braking and store the energy in the battery for later use.\r\n<ul>\r\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>:<br/>\r\n1.\tFord C-Max<br/>\r\n2.\tHonda Insight<br/>\r\n3.\tToyota Prius<br/></p>\r\n</ul>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h4>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle</h4>\nPlug-in hybrids are electric vehicles for the range anxious. Plug them into the wall at night, and when you drive away in the morning, you’ll have a store of energy that will allow you to go some distance without engaging the engine at all. These batteries are bigger and heavier than those that power gas/electric hybrids, but they also allow the car to operate at or near full power without engaging the engine. The Chevrolet Volt can travel thirty-eight miles before it starts using gas. Ford’s new C-Max plug-in hybrid can make it twenty-one miles on battery power alone. Once you run out of range, the engine takes over and powers the electric motor to keep the car moving.\n<ul>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>:<br/>\n1.\tChevrolet Volt<br/>\n2.\tFord C-Max Energi<br/>\n3.\tToyota Prius Plug-In Hybrid<br/></p>\n</ul>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>Electric Vehicle</h4>\nNo safety net here. These cars rely exclusively on battery power to operate. They take several hours to charge fully, and most have a range of around 100 miles (less if you’re driving fast or using air conditioning; the ideal conditions are city traffic on a sunny spring day).

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Improvements to the All-Season Tire</h4>Michelin has put significant effort into engineering a superior all-season tire, which it has done with a few key improvements. First, the tiremaker changed the tire’s makeup to include more silica, a component that improves grip. The new tire also has an asymmetrical tread design, which allows it to better evacuate water when the road is slick, and variable-thickness sipe technology, which aims to improve grip in wet conditions without compromising performance when it’s sunny and dry.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"The Pilot Sport A/S 3 compared favorably with its competition in each of the tests the Michelin crew had arranged on a gray, chilly day at the NOLA Motorsports Park in New Orleans. It turns when (and where) you tell it to turn, it stops when you tell it to stop, and if you push it past its limit it allows you to pull it back under control instead of leaving you spinning across the road.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<h4>Looking for Performance?</h4>If you’re not driving your car for performance (although, really – why aren’t you?), those differences may not mean much to you. And, in point of fact, this tire, with its ultra-high-performance designation, isn’t designed for drivers who just want to get to work and back every day without major incident. Michelin hasn’t released pricing on this tire yet, but it is almost certain that drivers who don’t need or want thrilling performance from their cars will be perfectly happy with a cheaper tire.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<h4>More of a Risk-Averse Type?</h4>Where the Michelin product made its best case – especially for the risk-averse, safety-minded driver – was in the braking distance test. In identical cars, with tires set to door sticker pressure, the Pilot Sport A/S 3 consistently came to a stop (from 60 mph, tested on wet and dry surfaces) ten or more feet sooner than its competitors. In an emergency, that’s the difference between a collision and a near miss. And that’s pretty compelling.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":7},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:14:22.850-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546462852 }} },{ "_id":333554,"title":"Los Angeles Auto Show","subTitle":"","slug":"los-angeles-auto-show","promoTitle":"Los Angeles Auto Show","promoTeaserSmall":"A Favorite video story from our first year: walk with me (and Elaine) around the 2012 L.A.

Five years later, Jennings went to Chrysler’s test track where she worked as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, she was hired as a writer at <em>Car and Driver</em> magazine when she was laid off her Chrysler job, and in 1985 she left to establish <em>Automobile Magazine</em> with David E.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

It features a tweaked version of the extended-range technology found in the Volt, and it can go 300 miles on a tank of gas.

There is no doubt it will be even more mobbed when the show opens to the public this weekend. This is no minor update – the seventh-generation Corvette is almost entirely new, using only a handful of parts from the previous generation. Featuring Chevrolet’s new 6.2-liter LT1 V-8 engine, it is the most powerful Corvette ever. Luckily for fuel-conscious buyers, technologies like active fuel management and variable valve timing mean it is also expected to be the most efficient Corvette ever. The Corvette Stingray will go on sale in the third quarter of 2013.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<strong>Ford</strong> unveiled its new truck concept, the <strong>Atlas,</strong> one of only a few concepts that hadn’t been teased before the show.

Other features include LED headlights and taillights and a 360-degree point-of-view camera.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"In case you missed the wave of publicity around its \"rebranding\" as The Lincoln Motor Company, Ford's luxury brand, <strong>Lincoln,</strong> has a new image and a new flagship, the MKZ. Here at Detroit, the focus was all on its crossover concept, the <strong>MKC.</strong> The MKC is a glimpse at what will be Lincoln’s first offering to the ever-expanding small utility segment. This concept, the smallest Lincoln ever, features a sloping roofline, a panoramic roof, and Lincoln’s new “split wing” grille. Lincoln says an eventual production car will feature unique powertrains and deliver a luxury experience. Lincoln hasn't named a timeline for a production version.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<strong>Honda</strong> also used the Detroit show to unveil its small-SUV concept (shown at top of the page), cleverly dubbed the <strong>Urban SUV Concept.</strong> Like the Lincoln MKC, the Urban SUV Concept is a new entry in the small-SUV segment.

Honda says a production version of the car will come to the U.S. market in 2014. It will be manufactured alongside the Fit at a new plant to be built in Mexico.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"Of course, these five cars are only the tip of the iceberg.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I personally would like to emphasize the meaning of premium to be high-performance and luxurious, rather than\nexpensive.\"","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"The Lexus IS is not only daring from a design standpoint, it is unapologetically performance minded, especially in its F Sport guise.\r\nAkio-san is firmly ruling the roost.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Lexus IS350 F Sport","fileMasterId":43612808,"fileName":"2014LexusIS350FSPORTjpg.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43612808/2014LexusIS350FSPORTjpg.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":347},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":621}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":43177864,"fileName":"Lexus_Grille_622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43177864/Lexus_Grille_622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":349},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":43177852,"fileName":"2014LexusIS250FSPORT_622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43177852/2014LexusIS250FSPORT_622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":619}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":43612814,"fileName":"Lexus.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43612814/Lexus.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":349},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":43177855,"fileName":"2014LexusIS250FSPORT010.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43177855/2014LexusIS250FSPORT010.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1409},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":3000}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":48394899,"fileName":"Lexus_F_Sport_Int_622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48394899/Lexus_F_Sport_Int_622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":351},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":48394902,"fileName":"Lexus_Interior_622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48394902/Lexus_Interior_622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":621}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":43177876,"fileName":"Lexus_Int_622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43177876/Lexus_Int_622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":621}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":43177867,"fileName":"Lexus_IF_Badge_622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43177867/Lexus_IF_Badge_622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":8,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":621}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":4,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:14:27.261-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546467262 }} },{ "_id":337315,"title":"The Daytona 24 Hours in Photos","subTitle":"","slug":"daytona-24-hours-in-photos","promoTitle":"The Daytona 24 Hours in Photos","promoTeaserSmall":"One of our Favorites from our first year!

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-27T13:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"daytona-24-homepage","title":"Daytona 24 Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66143487/Daytona-24-Homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66143487,"fileName":"Daytona-24-Homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":355},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-27T13:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"daytona-24-header","title":"Daytona 24 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66143484/Daytona-24-Header.jpg","fileMasterId":66143484,"fileName":"Daytona-24-Header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-27T13:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"daytona-24-homepage","title":"Daytona 24 Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66143487/Daytona-24-Homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66143487,"fileName":"Daytona-24-Homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":355},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}},"pages":[{"id":456239,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>The Rolex 24 at Daytona, January 2013</h3>\nI went to Daytona this January mainly to see Mazda's fledgling effort in the brand-new GTX class.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Maintenance & Service Center","id":1023755,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-13T13:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"jamie-little-book-review","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43651384/little-promolarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":43651384,"fileName":"little-promolarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-13T12:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"jamie-little-book-review","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44196146/Little-header.jpg","fileMasterId":44196146,"fileName":"Little-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-13T12:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"jamie-little-book-review","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44196149/little-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":44196149,"fileName":"little-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":457845,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"jamie-little-book-review","caption":"","fileMasterId":43652041,"fileName":"Little_04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43652041/Little_04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":0,"text":"On a rainy Friday night in Las Vegas, Jamie Little sits at a table in a casino's sports bar,  where buckets are catching drips from the roof.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

When she went to the theater, she bought two seats (one for herself and one for her purse).

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Reviews","id":1023765,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos/car-reviews","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"All Videos","id":1023756,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-12T11:42:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"New York Auto Show","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45274225/Jeep-on-NY-Track-300.jpg","fileMasterId":45274225,"fileName":"Jeep-on-NY-Track-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":299}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-12T13:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"New York Auto Show","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45300085/R-R-Wraith-2-622.jpg","fileMasterId":45300085,"fileName":"R-R-Wraith-2-622.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":621}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-12T10:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013-new-york-auto-show","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45261508/NY-Autoshow-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":45261508,"fileName":"NY-Autoshow-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":461940,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"adSetCode":"","alignment":"block","autoPlay":0,"disableAdPreRoll":false,"embedCode":"<object classid='clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000' id='ooyalaPlayer' width='1280' height='720'codebase='http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/swflash.cab'><param name='movie' value='http://www.ooyala.com/player.swf' /><param name='bgcolor' value='#000000' /><param name='wmode' value='Transparent'/><param name='allowScriptAccess' value='always' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><param name='flashvars' value='embedCode=MxMTJ3YToh3RPUE-2haVdRqRIdb1jooM&autoplay=0&loop=0&browserPlacement=4&width=1280&height=720&hide=info&wmode=Transparent' /><embed src='http://www.ooyala.com/player.swf' bgcolor='#000000' width='1280' height='720' name='ooyalaPlayer' wmode='Transparent' align='middle' play='0' loop='0' allowscriptaccess='always' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowfullscreen='true' flashvars='embedCode=MxMTJ3YToh3RPUE-2haVdRqRIdb1jooM&autoplay=0&loop=0&browserPlacement=4&width=1280&height=720&hide=info&wmode=Transparent' pluginspage='http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer'> </embed></object>","height":720,"loop":0,"maintainAspectRatio":true,"ooyalaId":"1_umml3ecp","thumbnailUrl":"https://cfvod.kaltura.com/p/1807801/sp/180780100/thumbnail/entry_id/1_umml3ecp/version/100000/acv/151","transparency":"transparent","videoLength":327000,"width":1280,"type":"video"},{"order":1,"text":"Everyone loves to go to the New York International Auto Show, the last big international show of the season, because it's in New York City.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

And that looked promising. He was bringing a Group A twin-cam Suzuki Cultus (Chevrolet Sprint in the U.S.), a real buzz bomb at just a tick over 1,800 pounds and bursting with a powerful 130-horse, sixteen-valve 1,299cc four-cylinder engine. It’s only competition in the under-1,300cc class would be from three tricked-out Toyota Starlets. Kenzo Sudo would be co-driving with Kenyu Azechi in a second Cultus—a backup parts car for Tajima’s effort. If Kenzo wasn’t worried by the language barrier, I wasn’t going to worry about it, either. I figured I could yell \"<em>Yakitori!</em>\" for the log piles (beef on a skewer, if you catch my drift), and for anything else that could kill us, I would smack Tajima on the helmet and yell \"No!\" real loud.

Rainstorms had battered Washington for weeks, and the forest roads were in pretty rough shape. One stage had already been canceled where part of the road gave way to a fifty-foot crater. As we wound our way through the mountains in the rent-a-car, trying to project how fast the Cultus would handle the slimy gravel and thick mud, Tajima would adjust the notes. \"Jean-san, no left five.

It was especially noticeable because we were sitting literally side by side, with arms nearly touching, in the tiny right-hand-drive car. I had to jam my right shoulder and arm inside the wing of the seat to keep from being pounded by Tajima’s flailing elbows as he ripped through turns.

A normal passenger who is able to drive should stop reaching for his footbrake after five minutes. Your driving should make him feel relaxed and safe by that time.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<strong>“The simple and obvious truth about cornering is that good drivers do it safely and bad drivers do not.”</strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"“Both of us are bad passengers and seem to suffer unduly from bad drivers. A lot of people start showing off as soon as they know you are a competition driver. They want to prove that they could have been world champions if they had been given the chance, so they go wild and take terrible risks…One of the worst examples was in America when a taxi-driver recognized us and started driving like mad over a wet, slippery road. Suddenly the car went broadside and for some strange reason both the rear doors flew open. We cowered in the back clutching at the seats and at each other to keep from falling out as the taxi went sideways down the street. The driver had his own way of dealing with the situation. He put all the blame on the cab and shouted at it: ‘Now then, Rosemary! That’s no way to behave.’ ”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"\r\n<h3>On Being Physically Comfortable in the Car</h3>\r\n“You should try to be physically relaxed while driving, and it is quite possible to do this while remaining mentally alert…We both have some experience of racing as well as rallying, and we can assure you that a racing driver who was physically tense and who clutched at the wheel would not have the sensitivity to drive the car fast round corners. The heart of a surgeon during a difficult operation probably beats as fast as the heart of a racing driver during a difficult race, but no one has ever suggested that a surgeon should hold his scalpel in the tight, feelingless grip of a boy whittling a stick. Good surgery and good driving both need a light sensitive touch.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h3>On Reading the Road</h3>\n\"Anticipation is one of the most valuable assets for good driving. The classic example was something which happened during the Monaco Grand Prix race in 1950. This race is run through the streets of Monte Carlo, and it was won that year by [Juan Manuel] Fangio, one of the best racing drivers of all time…He was roaring around the circuit in his Alfa Romeo and as he approached a tricky corner he suddenly noticed that there was something different about the crowd. It did not look the same as usual. There was not the normal whitish blur of faces.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"“Fangio braked hard. He realized that if the faces were not white, then the people in the crowd were not looking towards him. They were looking away from him at something more interesting. Fangio went round the corner more slowly than usual—and around it there was a tremendous pileup of racing cars. If he had been going at normal speed he would have crashed into them…The effect of good observation and interpretation in normal road driving can be just as dramatic and as important to the driver.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"“Observation comes first and interpretation follows...A driver traveling at 30 mph in town is able to notice events and movements in his immediate vicinity because his eyes are adjusted for what might be called close work. At 70 or 80 mph, a driver’s eyes are focused to observe things 200 or 300 or even 400 yards away. He is slow to notice things happening just a few feet from his car…The driver who thinks correctly will be able to appreciate the various and sometimes obscure possibilities of any particular traffic situation and to interpret his observations.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<h3>On Dealing with Other Drivers</h3>\r\n“Some people seem to regard it as their duty to ensure that no other motorist exceeds the speed limit. Some other people are genuinely worried about whether they can be charged with aiding and abetting a crime if they allow someone to overtake at 50 mph in a 40-mph zone.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"“Our advice to all these people is: If someone exceeding the speed limit wants to go past, then pull over and let him through. A driver who is unable to obey the law and keep within the speed limit may also be bumptious, overbearing, bad-tempered, and an appalling driver. So you should do everything in your power to see that there is as big a distance as possible between his car and yours.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<h3>On Rallying</h3>\n“Fog is probably the motorist’s worst enemy. Everybody hates it, including the authors. Nevertheless we have been quoted in newspapers once or twice as saying that we wanted fog on a particular rally. We admit that we did say so. We do like fog on rallies. The reason is that all cars are reduced to roughly the same speed…Our Saab cars have quite small engines, so fog on a rally is an advantage to us...”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"“There is really only one piece of advice that we can give to anyone who is preparing to try some competition driving.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-22T08:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013-porsche-cayenne-in-carmine-red","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46246844/cayenne-Promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":46246844,"fileName":"cayenne-Promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-22T08:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013-porsche-cayenne-in-carmine-red","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46246772/cayenne-header.jpg","fileMasterId":46246772,"fileName":"cayenne-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-22T08:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013-porsche-cayenne-in-carmine-red","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46246826/cayenne-01-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":46246826,"fileName":"cayenne-01-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":462756,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The best thing about Michigan winters is the sensation of slipping into flannel sheets at the end of the day.

As I drove, I kept moving my hands around on the steering wheel because it felt so damn good.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Mother’s Day is right around the corner, and nothing says love like a juicy-red, flannel-lined Porsche Cayenne.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":46247252,"fileName":"cayenne_09.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46247252/cayenne_09.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2736},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":3648}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":46246772,"fileName":"cayenne_header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46246772/cayenne_header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":46246766,"fileName":"cayenne_05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46246766/cayenne_05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":46246835,"fileName":"cayenne_06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46246835/cayenne_06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":46246769,"fileName":"cayenne_07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46246769/cayenne_07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":5,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20101,"make":"Porsche","model":"Cayenne","year":2013},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":8},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:14:36.034-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546476035 }} },{ "_id":342585,"title":"Ford's Good-Food Finder App","subTitle":"Know where to get a smoothie in Salinas?","slug":"fords-good-food-finder-app","promoTitle":"Ford's Good-Food Finder App","promoTeaserSmall":"Find good, healthy, even vegan eating places all over the U.S. with a free smartphone/iPad app.","promoTeaser":"Find good, healthy, even vegan eating places all over the U.S. with a free smartphone/iPad app.","keywords":["Ford's Good-Food Finder App"],"metaTitle":"Ford's Good-Food Finder App - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Ford's Good-Food Finder App","Ford Food App","Ford App","Ford Sync","SHFT","SHFT.com","Food Tripping","iPhone app","Bill Ford","Ford Motor Company","Peter Glatzer","Adrian Grenier","sustainable food","healthy food","healthy food sources","app for healthy food"],"metaDescription":"Ford's Good-Food Finder App, Food Tripping, can help smartphone and iPad users find good places to eat healthy food all over the U.S. The story is on JeanKnowsCars.com.","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2013-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2013-04-30T05:43:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2013-04-30T05:43:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":false,"url":"/cool-tech/car-apps/fords-good-food-finder-app/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[{"id":16111,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Holly Reich","firstName":"Holly","lastName":"Reich","jobTitle":"Contributor","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Holly has reported on cars, lifestyle, travel, and everything else for publications including the New York <em>Daily News, Redbook, Elite Traveler,</em> and Fox TV.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Give Them Map Power</h4>\nYes, you've got a fancy navigation system these days, plus Siri, plus Google Maps. Get an atlas or a paper map anyway that kids can write on with a highlighter, crumple up, and learn to fold. Any elementary school teacher will tell you that a tactile experience helps kids learn. Take off for a short day trip carrying a state, county, or city map. Picture how great it will look with your kid's carefully drawn route from home to the amusement park or the lake, and your kid using it to see how close to \"Are we there yet?\" you are. You can back it up with Google Maps, or put your kid on the computer and let him or her Google Map it for you. Then, let your kids take turns as navigator, sitting in the front passenger's seat if they're over twelve and tall enough, and using their maps to direct you. Okay, it's good to teach them how to use the car's navigation system, too. The point is to put your kids at the center of the navigation experience.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>3.

If you want to try that, put your kids in charge of writing things down like departure times, starting and ending mileage, and impressions of different places you stop. Give them a box to collect receipts, postcards, and brochures. Help them notice things like gasoline prices, figure out how many exits are left until you get to the next hotel, and suggest possible stopping points along the way. Keep kids actively involved in the process of getting where you are going.

(Not just presidents, but rock stars and TV actors they actually care about.) What geographical features shouldn't you miss when you're driving through? The whole time you are in that state, that kid is the go-to family member. Encourage them to notice if there's a town with an amusing or interesting name, or a sign for the Millard Fillmore Museum or the World's Largest Artichoke. Then pull off the highway and go look at the town for fifteen minutes. Help your kids figure out what a \"not to be missed\" experience consists of.

Give Kids Control of What the Family Hears and Watches...Up to a Point</h4>\nIf you've read this far, you must agree with me that a road trip with kids is not a necessary evil to get through, but an adventure to be embraced. If so, you'll want to avoid the temptation to plug your kids in to an endless cycle of videos, video games, and iPod music with headphones. I'm not saying you won't ever want to resort to that; technology allows each of us to have \"alone time\" while sitting right next to each other. That's exactly why you want to limit it. Why put everybody in the car as a family and then ignore each other? Instead, bite the bullet and let your kids have control of what the group listens to for some of the time, and listen to it together. Some of my favorite drives are when my teenage son Henry acts as DJ and plays me everything from vintage Bob Dylan to weird Japanese electronic music. I get some sense of what's going on inside his head.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":41,"text":"Take everybody to the library for audiobooks (or get a free <a href=http://omc.overdrive.com/ rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">OverDrive</a> account and borrow audiobooks from the library to download onto your iPhone, iPad, or iPod). Listen to short stories or podcasts that somehow relate to the place you're visiting. Get one of the kids to make a playlist of music that suits the trip. Even toddlers can learn to prefer stories read aloud in the car. That's so much better than a constant stream of cartoon videos that block out the scenery they should be looking at on a trip. Having said that, you don't have to be shackled to tween pop music stations the whole time, and you do get to put on NPR or whatever you'd rather be listening to. Sharing your favorite things, and then being patient while others share theirs, is a lesson the whole family can keep on learning.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":6},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:14:38.360-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546478361 }} },{ "_id":343850,"title":"Corry Weller, Off-Road Truck Racer","subTitle":"Rookie of the year--at 41.","slug":"corry-weller-off-road-truck-racer","promoTitle":"Corry Weller, Off-Road Truck Racer","promoTeaserSmall":"Another Fast Woman you should know.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Fast Women","id":1034957,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/fast-women","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-22T06:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"corry weller off road truck racer","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46837996/weller-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":46837996,"fileName":"weller-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-22T06:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"corry weller off road truck racer","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/53103453/weller-Header.jpg","fileMasterId":53103453,"fileName":"weller-Header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-22T06:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"corry weller off road truck racer","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/53103459/weller-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":53103459,"fileName":"weller-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":465441,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"For Corry Weller, driving a truck in the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series means soaring over jumps, slamming to the ground, and sliding sideways through 180-degree turns.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

They are rubber with large lips that look like they could hold a couple liters of liquid. The interior was also predictably smart; everything felt like it was built to be driven well over the century mark on the odometer. I expected the driving experience to be the same feeling—prudent and slightly dull. I was proven wrong on a quick trip to Target. The 2.0-liter turbocharged engine was actually fun to drive and will make me think twice about this car.<br/>\n<strong>Christina:</strong> I come from a Subaru-driving family. I love Subarus and I love the way this one drives. However, I didn’t feel comfortable behind the wheel at all. The steering wheel blocked the gauges. The color display over the touchscreen was distracting. The climate control knobs were confusing. And the ceiling? Despite the fact that I’m short, I felt my head was up too close to the headliner once I adjusted the driver’s seat so that I had a good view of the road. I'd hate to be a tall person driving this one.<br/>\n<strong>Laura:</strong> I have known lots of people who drove Subarus, since we live in a wintry, and also a hippieish, climate here in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I haven’t considered owning one myself until now, because none of my friends’ cars were this good. This Subaru is utterly practical: I love the power liftgate, the stealth storage cubbies under the cargo floor, and the rubber mats everywhere that manage to look good while they make you start thinking about owning this Forester for ten years. The best part: while you’re driving around feeling smart and capable, like the kind of person who reads <em>Consumer Reports</em> for fun, notice how much fun you are having in this car.<br/>\n<strong>Jean:</strong> I've recommended a Forester to three different people in the past month. That was before I knew it had—wait for it—<em>a power liftgate!</em> The Forester has been solid from Day One, ten years ago. It now feels a lot bigger and a lot more grown-up-looking inside (although the exterior still looks awkwardly adolescent).

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"New Car Features","id":1034782,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/new-car-features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-26T11:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"mercedes benz illuminated star","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/49641685/mercedes-illuminated-PromoLarge.png","fileMasterId":49641685,"fileName":"mercedes-illuminated-PromoLarge.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-26T11:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"mercedes benz illuminated star","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/49641688/mercedes-illuminated-header.png","fileMasterId":49641688,"fileName":"mercedes-illuminated-header.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-26T11:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"mercedes benz illuminated star","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/49641532/mercedes-illuminated-homepage.png","fileMasterId":49641532,"fileName":"mercedes-illuminated-homepage.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":469256,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Are you thinking of buying a brand-new Mercedes-Benz but are worried that your expensive luxury car just won’t be eye-catching enough?

Which is what every minivan owner I know says they want. The back-seat passengers will appreciate optional dual opening glass moonroofs (below left) and second-row power windows, because in most minivans they get little to no fresh air back there.  They’ll also like the fact that the second and third rows raise gradually like theater seats.

Another is the availability of a “sporty” SE model with side skirting, nineteen-inch alloy wheels, a lower stance with a sport-tuned suspension, and smoked taillights. And yet another is that you can configure the Sienna as an eight-passenger vehicle by having a second-row bench seat (the Odyssey has this, too, but the others don’t).

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-07-29T13:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"toyota lexus art contests","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54472321/contest-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":54472321,"fileName":"contest-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-07-29T13:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"toyota lexus art contests","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56863728/contest-header.jpg","fileMasterId":56863728,"fileName":"contest-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-07-29T13:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"toyota lexus art contests","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54472246/contest-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":54472246,"fileName":"contest-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":516950,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"For as long as there have been cars, there have been people imagining their dream cars.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-06T08:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 mini cooper s roadster","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55625080/mini-roadster-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":55625080,"fileName":"mini-roadster-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-06T08:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 mini cooper s roadster","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55625122/mini-roadster-header1.jpg","fileMasterId":55625122,"fileName":"mini-roadster-header1.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-06T08:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 mini cooper s roadster","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57299781/mini-roadster-homepage-copy.jpg","fileMasterId":57299781,"fileName":"mini-roadster-homepage-copy.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":517301,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>The Car:</h3>\n<strong>Price:</strong> $35,345 as tested (including destination charge)</br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Turbocharged 1.6-liter inline four-cylinder, 181 horsepower</br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed automatic with paddle shifters</br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 26 mpg city/34 mpg highway</br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Semi-automatic convertible roof</br> \n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Mini Wired package, including voice command, navigation, Bluetooth, and USB/iPod connectivity ($750)</br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Audi TT, Fiat 500, Mazda MX-5 Miata, Volkswagen Eos<br>\n<br>\nSee more specs on the Mini Cooper in our <a href=http://www.jeanknowscars.com/mini/cooper/ target=\"_blank\">Car Guide.</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2013 mini cooper s roadster","caption":"","fileMasterId":55360342,"fileName":"mini_roadster_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55360342/mini_roadster_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":1,"text":"<h3>What I Think:</h3>\nI think everyone in America would agree that the Mini Cooper S Roadster is cute.

Meanwhile, the speedometer is in the center of the vehicle. It is not intuitive to look over to the center to check your speed, and on top of that, the speedometer is not easy to read. I realize that a center speedometer is part of the Mini heritage, but you could achieve the same feeling by putting something less essential in the center position—for instance, the Openometer, a dial that monitors how long the roof has been open over the life of the vehicle as well as on the current drive.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[{"articleId":226904,"name":"00","promoImage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-01-11T10:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Fiat Lust","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46223934/Fiat-Lust-300.jpg","fileMasterId":46223934,"fileName":"Fiat-Lust-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":299}},"promoTeaser":"Now divorced, children older, a mother of three ponders her next car.","title":"Fiat Lust: Part 1","url":"/you-auto-know/car-buying/fiat-lust/"},{"articleId":337494,"name":"article0","promoImage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-06T12:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Fiat Lust","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44003132/Fiat-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":44003132,"fileName":"Fiat-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"promoTeaser":"It's time to shop seriously for a 500: I find myself looking daggers at other women driving them.","title":"Fiat Lust, Part 2: My Shopping List","url":"/you-auto-know/car-buying/fiat-lust-part-two-shopping-list/"},{"articleId":342884,"name":"article0","promoImage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-09T13:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"fiat lust part three test drives","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46786790/fiat3-promoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":46786790,"fileName":"fiat3-promoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"promoTeaser":"Did the road lead back to the 500?","title":"Fiat Lust, Part 3: My Test Drives","url":"/you-auto-know/car-buying/fiat-lust-part-3-my-test-drives/"}],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-13T07:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"fiat lust part 4","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56261518/fiatlust-4-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":56261518,"fileName":"fiatlust-4-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-09T13:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"automoblox rescue vehicles","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55910698/fiatlust-4-header.jpg","fileMasterId":55910698,"fileName":"fiatlust-4-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-13T07:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"fiat lust part 4","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57887715/fiatlust-4-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":57887715,"fileName":"fiatlust-4-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":532561,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<em>My story began in the winter with <a href=http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/fiat-lust/ target=\"_blank\">Part One, </a>when I first started considering whether I could justify replacing my Honda Odyssey with a Fiat 500.

And the saga continues:</em>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"A colleague of mine bought a car recently. In less than a week, he had picked his make (Toyota), model (Camry Hybrid), accessories (none), named his price (low), and taken delivery. Exceptional efficiency, driven in part by necessity, given that his engine had fried, but I suspected that there was more to it than that. I suspected pragmatism, and I asked how he ordered food at a restaurant. “I look at the menu, decide what I want, and order.” Wow. It’s that simple?! If only…  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Restaurant patrons fall into two categories: the determined and the deliberative. The determined make their dining decisions with startling ease, and, often, food is fuel for them, not an experience. The deliberative (you know who you are) pore over the menu, ponder, ask questions, ruminate, ask more questions, deliberate further, and then—finally—decide, often on what seems an arbitrary whim. If the decision doesn’t hit the spot, regret overshadows the meal. If the decision is spot on, the dining experience is beyond divine. The deliberative require patience. Their waiters, I might add, deserve a rather generous tip.  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"You can imagine, then, what it is like for a deliberative to make a car decision, particularly with such a myriad of possibilities of models, accessories, and color combinations. Apparently, being deliberative is a characteristic of Fiat customers.  “You are a special breed,” my saleswoman, Corky, cried on my fourth visit. “I’ve got six of you who have been trying to make a decision for over two months!”  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"I liked to believe that I was just doing things in the slow, contemplative Italian way, employing the careful consideration with which one might approach a languorous meal in the Tuscan countryside. A friend of mine shattered my dreamy Italianate fantasy by rather bluntly suggesting that my inability to decide on a vehicle and my excuses of being too busy with work and children to focus on my purchase paralleled my apparent excuses of why I couldn’t start dating. Perhaps I had a fear of commitment?  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Fear of commitment seems a little harsh, but she was on to something. I have never engaged in a purchase of this magnitude on my own before. It seemed extravagant, so I was hesitant. Moreover, on top of my general deliberative nature, trepidation of an extra financial burden certainly weighed on my mind. However, the rise in gas prices in May and June and the subsequent $300 I spent on fuel for my Honda Odyssey each month, coupled with the fact that the Odyssey was tripping over 170,000 miles, spurred me into action. Extravagance became necessity.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>Which Fiat 500?</h3>\nThe first step required deciding between the new Fiat 500L and the traditional 500. On an intellectual and practical level, the 500L had real appeal. Intellectually, the factors that drove the design—Cinquecento history and modernist aesthetic—spoke to my academic sensibility. Practically, the design fits my life—it has four doors and can easily seat five with plenty of room for bags, groceries, and even our Bernese mountain dog. It is fun to drive, although one does have to hope Fiat works on the comfort of the seats in future models. Clearly, the 500L was the sensible choice.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"As functional and quirky as the 500L is, however, it simply did not speak to me the way the Cinquecento did. Twice I went to the dealership to test drive a 500L and a 500, trying to convince myself that I wanted the 500L. No matter how I wished it, the 500L did not evoke that sense of association with <em>La Dolce Vita</em> so dear to me that the Cinquecento did. If emotion is not supposed to drive car purchasing decisions, I have spectacularly failed the test. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h3>Back to the Dealer</h3>\nSo there I was with three children in tow, once again, to see if they could all fit in a Cinquecento. We took a number of spins, changing seats along the way. My eldest, Sarah, is presently the tallest; she staked out her front seat privilege immediately. Her brother, Nico, however, will soon be little in birth order only, a fact he gleefully announced with a wicked glimmer in his eye. My youngest and smallest child, Stephanie, ever the sly diplomatic one, extolled the comfort and benefits of the back seat. Maybe Sarah and Nico should both consider its excellent features, like the headrests, and, since Stephanie is the smallest, she could sit up front with the seat pulled forward and there would be plenty of room for both of them in the back!  With thoughts of the 500L in the back of my mind, I reasoned that the times all four of us will drive around town will be limited. Plus, their seat negotiations will provide me no end of amusement. The Cinquecento was the way to go.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"Back at the dealership, Corky and I sat down to discuss the financial realities. She, too, is in the unenviable club of having been through a bitter divorce. As a female sales associate in an automobile dealership, she is a woman making it in a world still dominated by men. We are both women who work long hours to provide as best we can for our children, and in their own way, our respective associations with Fiat represent the new lives we are each building. I certainly felt that gender played into the reception I had at the dealerships of other brands in a negative way. I like to believe that I would have gotten a Fiat regardless, but the fact that my salesperson was a woman in a position not unlike my own certainly added to my comfort with the decision.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"When I explained how my credit rating took a hit during some financial machinations during the separation, she understood the implications on a larger level and immediately called in the finance manager so we could review all the options. My decision to get a Fiat was more than an issue of reducing fuel costs; it was also becoming a means to restoring my financial foundations—an unexpected bonus.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<h3>Financial Decisions</h3>\r\nShould I lease or should I buy? I had intended to lease, but I wanted to review the implications of both options. With a lease’s lower monthly payment, my debt-to-income ratio would be lower. Leasing it was. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"What about pricing? Many employers and associations enable preferred pricing—automatic discounts with verification of employment. It is astounding how many people in Ann Arbor are not aware of preferred pricing programs, which save not only money but also hassle on negotiations. It’s always worth checking. What were my possibilities: university association? Chrysler’s Friends program? We went through the options and identified the best program for me.   ","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"automoblox rescue vehicles","caption":"","fileMasterId":57746433,"fileName":"fiatlust_4_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57746433/fiatlust_4_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":13,"text":"What about dealer incentives? Suddenly, as if on cue, we heard the sound of an engine starting and an exclamation from a vehicle inside the showroom: “I didn’t know it would do <em>that</em>!\" We looked over to see my twelve-year-old grinning sheepishly, holding a key. He had been amusing himself with the Abarth videos at the video terminal and had hopped into one in the showroom to see what they were like. The previous customer had been testing out the key functions; Nico wanted to see the dash lights in action. Mental note: when I actually come to purchase a specific car, leave the children at home.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"Dealer incentives—these are the lucky lottery elements of Fiat purchasing.   They are fleeting, coming and going at a moment’s notice. Some are model specific, such as for the Pop; some are regional; some are seasonal. There are incentives for leasing and purchasing, and with them, the savings can be significant. With incentives in play, could they run numbers on the different models? I wanted to be sure of my options. Patience being a part of Fiat sales, Corky agreed and laughed as she said, “I’d hate to see you in a restaurant!” Little did she know…","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"<h3>Finding the One</h3>\r\nArmed with my pricing information, I then needed to narrow down to the model and color. I run a benevolent dictatorship in my house, so the children’s opinions are welcome, but I am the ultimate arbiter. Sarah and Stephanie voted for the convertible, the 500c, but cost and the complete loss of trunk space ruled it out. Nico advocated strongly for the Abarth—such a dude car. The cost, however, was prohibitive, and vroom, vroom, vrooming all over town held little appeal for me. They all wanted Beats Audio. I did, too, but Corky gently pointed out that one does lose cargo space with the woofer. Beats Audio might have to wait for the next Fiat.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"I test-drove all viable possibilities: Pop, Sport, Lounge, and Turbo. Compared with the others in drive and ride, the Pop just didn’t grab me, and it doesn’t have leather seats—which I considered a must. The Lounge seemed too extravagant, so I couldn’t consider it; the Sport had the right drive, yet the Turbo had the feel I liked. If we could find a Turbo that worked financially, that would be the car. If not, the Sport was the most practical option, so I thought.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":17,"text":"And, color? Stephanie voted for yellow, but the canary-and-black contrast was too much for me. Nico wanted black with red leather (too many Abarth videos, clearly). And Sarah, my sixteen-year-old? “Mom,” she tossed out sardonically, “if you’re going to drive a sexy car, you can’t do a half-assed job of it. Red.”  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":18,"text":"Color became the hang-up, and this was the one place Fiat’s marketing didn’t work for me. In what could be considered an eco-friendly move, Fiat is not big on traditional brochures, so most of my looking was done online. The girls now away on summer adventures, Nico and I spent an evening on the sofa watching every Fiat video on the website to try to decide on color and model. We learned a great deal about the history of the Abarth, Abarth racing, and the fact that the scorpion logo was due to Carlo Abarth’s astrological sign (a fact my Scorpio child loved). For days after, we would giggle and spontaneously burst into the “Sexy People” Fiat song, quite a moment in the middle of Whole Foods, but our evening on the computer didn’t help narrow down the choice. The website simply doesn’t offer much in terms of color insight. One can pick the exterior color there, but the colors displayed are a far cry from the actual colors of the vehicles.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":19,"text":"“What about that light blue?” Nope. On the website, Fiat’s Luce Blu appeared too close to Carolina Blue. As a Duke alum, there was no way I was going to drive a Carolina Blue car.  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":20,"text":"Interiors? One can’t sample their various configurations. Dashboard and seat color combinations change depending on make, model, and accessories, such as cloth or leather seats. At present, the way one can play with those configurations on the website is quite limited. To find “the one,” I was going to have to see it in person, and I would know it when I saw it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":21,"text":"A week later, Corky called. Fifteen new vehicles had just been delivered, including a number of Sport models, and it was now the end of July. Some of the incentives were ending on the thirty-first. I phoned Marley, my sitter. Could she meet me at the dealership with Nico? With August and all the impending camp driving it entails almost upon us, I had to take the plunge, and I wanted to test-drive different color options—Rosso Brillante, Bianco Perla, and Nero—one last time. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":22,"text":"Nico had his hockey stick with him, as hockey boys do, and I realized that we had measured fitting the hockey bag in the trunk, but what about the stick? Moreover, with Marley standing next to him, it occurred to me that I hadn’t taken anyone on a test drive who was taller than five feet, five inches. Marley is five feet, nine inches, and long in the torso. So there we were, Marley, Nico, the hockey stick, and me, test-driving a black Sport with a sunroof. It all fit, but Marley looked a little cramped and had only a couple of inches to spare. The sunroof takes away 1.3 inches of headroom. Suddenly, I realized, I was looking at getting a vehicle that would require passengers to pass an amusement park test: <em>You must be under six feet tall to get on this ride.</em> As one of my dear friends is more than six feet tall, that didn’t seem particularly considerate.   ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":23,"text":"I walked into the showroom to ask Corky if there were models without sunroofs, and then I saw it. There, in front of me, was the one! It was everything I had said I wouldn’t consider: a Luce Blu Lounge with cloth seats and a fixed glass moonroof. The creamy-white steering wheel and radio contrasted beautifully with the pale metallic blue and black of the dash in a mod throwback to the 1960s. The white-and-black checked seats and the subtle red stitching of the 500 logo added to the cool retro feel. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":24,"text":"We hopped in. The moonroof provided a whole new dimension of spaciousness, adding height and opening the interior volume. I hadn’t considered the Lounge because it tends to come with all the trappings, which elevate its cost, generally to around the $23,000 range. Yet, this one, without leather seats and Beats Audio, had a sticker price of $19,700. It really was the one.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":25,"text":"A deposit reserved it for me, and the next day, Corky and the finance manager agreed to stay late so we could close the deal. As luck would have it, Fiat had just announced a new incentive for leasing that had not been there the night before. This car was meant to be. All of the financial legwork I had done in the preceding months paid off. Signing the forms was the most painless part, but it was not without trepidation that I put pen to paper. I was committing.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"automoblox rescue vehicles","caption":"","fileMasterId":57746430,"fileName":"fiatlust_4_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57746430/fiatlust_4_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":26,"text":"<h3>A Moment of Reflection, Then Contentment</h3>\nAs I drove off the lot, I realized that I had done everything backward.

Reason may have set the boundaries, but passion drove the decision. This was not the pragmatic way to purchase a car!","type":"paragraph"},{"order":27,"text":"Then a calm descended. It took four months of deliberating, but the calm washing over me was that same lovely feeling one has after a long, languorous meal in a Tuscan village, where the setting sun gives way to the candlelit table of friends bathed in moonlight, relaxing contentedly with palates sated.

But they are different—one a government agency, one a nonprofit sponsored by insurance companies—and their tests differ somewhat. You should look at results from both to get a complete picture. Having said that, these two groups choose to test a sample of vehicles that they expect will sell in large volumes or that have been recently redesigned—and they buy the vehicles from dealerships themselves.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"Every model on the market doesn’t get tested, but every vehicle sold in the United States does have to meet federal motor vehicle safety standards.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation. This is the group that provides the starred reviews you see on a new car’s window sticker. NHTSA rates cars from one to five stars in frontal crash, side crash, and rollover tests and also provides an overall safety score. You can find NHTSA’s ratings online at <a href=http://www.safercar.gov rel=”nofollow” target=”_blank”>safercar.gov.</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"The IIHS is a nonprofit research group sponsored by the insurance industry. It assigns cars Good, Acceptable, Marginal, or Poor ratings for rear crash, side crash, rollover roof strength, and two types of front crash tests.

You can find IIHS ratings online at <a href=http://www. iihs.org/ratings rel=”nofollow” target=”_blank”>iihs.org/ratings.</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"How does that Good, Acceptable, or Marginal rating on a 2013 model compare with the overall safety of, say, a 2007 or earlier model? That’s a good question, because IIHS has recently toughened up its front crash testing, and NHTSA stiffened its testing criteria for 2011 and newer models, leading to lower ratings in some cases. The bottom line is, vehicles are getting better, and to some extent, that’s because these crash test ratings incentivize manufacturers to improve their products and get higher scores. As NHTSA says, “The intention of the new ratings and tougher crash tests is to encourage manufacturers to build the safest vehicles possible.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>NHTSA’s Testing</h3>\nNHTSA performs one front crash test and two side crash tests on all cars it chooses to rate.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<strong>Front Crash:</strong> NHTSA’s front crash test is a full-frontal crash that slams cars into a solid barrier. It's a simulation of a head-on crash in which both vehicles are traveling at the same rate of speed, 35 mph. Driver and front passenger dummies help measure the forces that create chest deflection, neck extension, and femur and foot injuries. A recent tweak to the test replaced a male passenger dummy with a smaller, female dummy.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<strong>Side Crash:</strong> The side crash test simulates being hit from the side by a 3,015-pound car traveling at 38.5 mph. As the agency says, it's a simulation of an intersection-type crash. NHTSA collects data on chest, head, abdomen, and pelvis injuries sustained by the driver and head and pelvis injuries sustained by the left rear passenger. The driver dummy represents an average-size male, while the rear passenger dummy represents a female.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"The side crash test also includes a sideways-into-pole test, which slams the vehicle into a pole 25 centimeters (about ten inches) in diameter at 20 mph at a 75-degree angle. This is a simulation of a crash into a fixed object, such as a utility pole or a tree. The pole hits at the driver’s seating location, and the test measures the head and pelvis injuries to the driver and the front passenger. NHTSA combines the ratings of the two side crash tests for its overall side crash score.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<strong>Rollover:</strong>  NHTSA also performs rollover testing on most SUVs, pickups, and minivans. It runs the vehicles through a fishhook maneuver, starting at 35 mph with speed increasing until the car either fails (two wheels lift off the ground) or passes without incident at 50 mph.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"You can search NHTSA's <a href=http://www.safercar.gov rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">safercar.gov database</a> by vehicle make and model, manufacturer, and vehicle class to narrow down the car that’s right for you or look up the ratings for a car you already own.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<h3>IIHS’s Testing</h3>\nIIHS conducts two front crash tests, a side crash test, a rollover test, and a rear crash test. Their tests differ significantly from NHTSA’s, so it’s worth looking at both when you’re shopping for a car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"<strong>Front Crash:</strong> IIHS performs both moderate overlap and small overlap front crash tests. While NHTSA’s tests crash a car’s entire front end into an immobile barrier, IIHS simulates crashing just part of a vehicle’s front end into a car of a similar weight. In moderate overlap tests, 40 percent of a car’s front end hits a deformable barrier at 40 mph.  The small overlap test engages just 25 percent of a car’s crumple zone, with test cars hitting a rigid barrier with the front left corner of the car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"Both front crash tests record forces to test the dummy’s head, neck, chest, legs, and feet. These tests sometimes cause cars to spin, which might engage side curtain airbags as well as front airbags.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"<strong>Side Crash:</strong> The IIHS side crash test is similar to NHTSA’s, but it uses a heavier barrier (3,300 pounds instead of 3,015 pounds) and a higher point of impact, which aims to simulate being hit by a truck or an SUV. The test uses a female dummy in the driver’s seat and a twelve-year-old child dummy in the rear passenger seat. The rest of the IIHS tests use adult male dummies.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":17,"text":"<strong>Rear Crash:</strong> For rear crash tests, the IIHS first evaluates a car’s head restraints. If they are improperly designed or positioned, the car automatically fails the test. Cars with head restraints that could effectively protect a driver’s head and neck in the event of a collision are hit from the rear by a similarly sized car traveling at 20 mph.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":18,"text":"<strong>Rollover:</strong> IIHS uses roof strength as a measure of rollover safety in cars. The test involves pressing a metal plate against one side of a car’s roof until the roof gives way. Cars that earn a Good rating must withstand four times their own weight before the roof reaches five inches of crush.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":19,"text":"In addition to ratings for individual tests, IIHS awards the best performers with a Top Safety Pick or Top Safety Pick Plus designation. Top Safety Picks must earn a Good rating in the moderate overlap front, side, rollover, and rear crash tests. Small overlap results are not taken into account for the Top Safety Pick award. To earn Top Safety Pick Plus, cars must earn a Good rating in four of the IIHS’s five tests and at least an Acceptable rating in the fifth. Small overlap results are considered for the Top Safety Pick Plus designation.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":20,"text":"<h3>The Fine Print</h3>\nNHTSA and IIHS are both careful to specify that shoppers shouldn’t compare crash ratings across vehicle types (don’t compare a Honda Fit to a Chevrolet Tahoe, for instance) or compare vehicles subjected to different crash tests. NHTSA and IIHS have both updated their tests in recent years to make them more stringent, so make sure to compare crash test ratings only among cars that were subjected to the same tests.<br>\n<br>\nHeard enough about crash tests for one day?

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-14T12:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"smart electric city tour","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56408098/smart-citydrive-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":56408098,"fileName":"smart-citydrive-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-14T12:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"smart electric city tour","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58030155/smart-city-header.jpg","fileMasterId":58030155,"fileName":"smart-city-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-14T12:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"smart electric city tour","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56408107/smart-citydrive-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":56408107,"fileName":"smart-citydrive-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":535085,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Smart invited a bevy of local journalists to spend time in the brand-new 2013 Electric Drive, the EV version of the Smart ForTwo.

As Ford explained, the EPA rules work on a “general label” principle, requiring auto companies to test only one vehicle in each family so that every single variant of every car doesn’t have to be tested.

Here, 100 C-Max Hybrid owners have reported their actual fuel economy in the real world: an average of 39.1 mpg. Now, let’s consider what kind of person would keep that kind of close track and go report it to an EPA database.

The EPA also states that “your mileage may vary” is not just a saying.

In his spare time when he wasn’t founding the bank, serving as the first mayor, and representing the area as state senator, Swink also started the town on the lucrative business of melon farming.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now.

In our test car, the engine makes 200 horsepower, but a recent engine update bumped Beetle Turbo models up to 210 horsepower. Volkswagen says the update shaves 0.2 second off the Beetle Turbo’s 0-to-60-mph time and translates to a four to eight percent fuel economy savings.<br>\n<br>\n• Volkswagen is tweaking the Beetle convertible lineup for 2014. The Beetle Turbo convertible will be rebadged as the Beetle R-Line Convertible. Volkswagen’s R-Line offerings are performance inspired, but this new designation doesn’t come with any powertrain changes. It's the same old Turbo with a brand-new name.<br>\n<br>\n• The Beetle convertible lineup features three engine choices. In addition to this car’s turbocharged four-cylinder powerplant, there’s a 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine that makes 170 horsepower and starts at $25,790, including destination, and a TDI model with a 2.0-liter 140-horsepower diesel-burning engine. The diesel Beetle costs a little more (starting at $28,690), but it’s rated at 28 mpg in the city and 41 mpg on the highway.<br>\n<br>\n• This Beetle is one of the few convertibles on the market to offer a rear seat, and it’s surprisingly roomy. An adult might feel cramped, but most kids will fit just fine.<br>\n<br>\n• It’s hard to name many direct competitors to the Beetle convertible, since so much of its appeal comes from its unique history and design, but check out other small, quirky convertibles like the Fiat 500c or the Mini Cooper convertible.<br>\n<br>\n• For $30,665, you might expect a nicer interior (this Beetle is awash in plastic and leatherette), but if you ever feel ripped off, just remember: you’re driving a convertible. The power folding top is fully automatic and can operate while the vehicle is moving at speeds of up to 31 mph.<br>\n<br>\n• Style features: Three-color adjustable ambient lighting, leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel and leather-wrapped shift knob, eighteen-inch aluminum alloy wheels, leather seating surfaces (standard in Turbo with Sound and Navigation), and gloss black exterior mirror housings, available in special 50s, 60s, and 70s edition decade-themed models.<br>","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":9},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:14:50.684-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546490685 }} },{ "_id":403238,"title":"Safest Places to Drive?","subTitle":"","slug":"safest-places-to-drive","promoTitle":"Safest Places to Drive?","promoTeaserSmall":"Allstate study names the U.S. cities with the fewest (and most) crashes per person.","promoTeaser":"Allstate study names the U.S. cities with the fewest (and most) crashes per person.","keywords":["safest places to drive"],"metaTitle":"Safest Places to Drive? - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Allstate","NHTSA","auto accidents","Allstate Insurance Company","car accidents","car crashes","Allstate Best Drivers Report","auto accidents","frequency of auto accidents"],"metaDescription":"Safest Places to Drive?

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding.

There, 140 assemblers were stationed along the line to install parts on a chassis that engineers had constructed using a winch and a rope. From this crude beginning, the process quickly evolved. The following year, the rope was replaced by an endless chain. The time it took to produce one vehicle was reduced by over nine hours to fewer than three. Ford had created a win-win: he got filthy rich, and the middle class got to drive cars.\n \nThe idea of moving the product to the worker rather than the worker to the product was revolutionary, and it helped smooth out the pacing of production. By 1916, the number of Model Ts produced reached 585,388, but the big news was the price had been significantly reduced. The Touring model now sold for only $360. According to an inflation calculator, that would equate to roughly $8,500 today.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

It wouldn’t have seemed out of place in a 1970s TV detective drama, perhaps driven by one of the bad guys. If he were still working out of Malibu, TV’s Jim Rockford might have driven this instead of the Pontiac Firebird he used to park outside the trailer. That’s not a slur on the Avenger: this is a solidly well-priced car that stands out from the modern pack of mid-size sedans specifically because it does look so old school and timeless.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"What can you buy for under $25,000 that doesn’t look entry level?

This car is perfect for the older driver who is not technologically savvy. Three fifty-cent-piece size buttons control the climate control, and the UConnect system is very user-friendly. In fact, the entire car is very utilitarian and would appeal to a cost-conscious buyer who desires efficiency over modern design.  To really seal the deal in the older-customer niche, Dodge will need to add a retirement beige exterior that can be completed with the already available frost interior.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Dodge Avenger SXT","fileMasterId":59588104,"fileName":"avenger_09.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59588104/avenger_09.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Dodge Avenger SXT has the optional Blacktop appearance package.","fileMasterId":55624904,"fileName":"avenger_06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55624904/avenger_06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":376},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":592}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Dodge Avenger SXT's old-school looks make it stand out from the mid-size pack.","fileMasterId":61184997,"fileName":"avenger_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61184997/avenger_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":346},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":545}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Dodge Avenger SXT interior is comfortable and well appointed.","fileMasterId":59587777,"fileName":"avenger_07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59587777/avenger_07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Dodge Avenger SXT's dials are satisfying to use, easy to find.","fileMasterId":61185006,"fileName":"avenger_05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61185006/avenger_05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Dodge Avenger SXT we tested had a six-speed automatic transmission.","fileMasterId":59587768,"fileName":"avenger_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59587768/avenger_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Dodge Avenger SXT","fileMasterId":59587765,"fileName":"avenger_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59587765/avenger_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Dodge Avenger SXT interior detail","fileMasterId":61184976,"fileName":"avenegr_04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61184976/avenegr_04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Dodge Avenger SXT","fileMasterId":59634283,"fileName":"avenger_10.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59634283/avenger_10.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":8,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Dodge Avenger SXT","fileMasterId":61185012,"fileName":"avenger_08.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61185012/avenger_08.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":9,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":639}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":14,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":33025,"make":"Dodge","model":"Avenger","year":2013},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:14:57.726-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546497728 }} },{ "_id":429349,"title":"5 Ways to Grow a Better Driver","subTitle":"","slug":"grow-a-better-driver","promoTitle":"5 Ways to Grow a Better Driver","promoTeaserSmall":"Don't miss the chance to mentor a teenage driver...and to brush up your own skills.","promoTeaser":"Don't miss the chance to mentor a teenage driver...and to brush up your own skills.","keywords":["Grow a Better Driver"],"metaTitle":"5 Ways to Grow a Better Driver -

Both cars are plenty powerful and capable, and when you’re driving them they feel exactly right: comfortable, responsive, attractive, engaging. They also have the advantage of conferring a certain status upon the driver.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Road Trips","id":1034777,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-road-trips","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-29T18:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"meinmrsong_homepage","title":"what i drove oct 28","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55986698/MeinMrSong-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":55986698,"fileName":"MeinMrSong-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1192},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2440}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-29T18:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"meinmrsong_01","title":"what i drove oct 28","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55986695/meinmrsong-01.jpg","fileMasterId":55986695,"fileName":"meinmrsong-01.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-29T18:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"meinmrsong_homepage","title":"what i drove oct 28","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55986698/MeinMrSong-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":55986698,"fileName":"MeinMrSong-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1192},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2440}}},"pages":[{"id":571090,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"what i drove oct 28","caption":"","fileMasterId":55986716,"fileName":"wherethecx5sgo_06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55986716/wherethecx5sgo_06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>I made a whirlwind tour of Southern California last weekend.</strong> It began with collecting a 2014 Soul Red Metallic Mazda CX-5 at Wally Park.

The car is longer, lower, and wider than previous models, creating a more spacious interior. The new Forte also sports Kia’s Uvo infotainment suite, standard in our EX model, available heated seats, and a standard cooling glove box. The Forte is also eminently affordable. Our top trim level model cost just over $20,000 after destination, which makes it one of a relatively small group of cars that are genuinely affordable for first-time car buyers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Despite all this, when I took hold of the keys to the Forte I wasn’t expecting to be won over. That’s because, for whatever reason, the Kia brand has never been particularly high on my list. Yes, they’ve got a bunch of interesting, attractive cars. And those <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsJiGF_Groo&noredirect=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">hamster commercials</a> are undeniably hilarious. But when I think of cars I’d like to own, I don’t think of Kia.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"Still, I kept an open mind as I stepped up to the Forte for the first time. The redesigned exterior features a more aggressive grille and headlight design, as well as some sculpting on the body panels. It’s no supermodel, but these touches are a big improvement over last year’s model. The interior isn’t exactly what you’d call stunning, either; our model featured cloth seats that were already starting to look worn and ratty after just a few thousand miles in the press fleet.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Luckily, leather seat trim is available in the Forte’s Premium package. That package adds a hefty $2,600 to the price of the car, but I’d happily pay extra for the heated leather seating, power sunroof, and push-button start (the Premium package also adds ambient lighting, a six-way adjustable driver’s seat, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror). The Forte’s Technology package also costs $2,600. It adds navigation with HD radio, LED taillights, projector beam headlights, a color LCD driver information display in the dash, and automatic dual-zone climate control.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2014 kia forte","caption":"","fileMasterId":56189168,"fileName":"kia_forte_08.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56189168/kia_forte_08.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":5,"text":"I was surprised to see that our Forte came standard with Kia’s Uvo infotainment suite. This system gives drivers a small 4.2-inch display with SiriusXM radio capability, a rearview camera, and optional navigation services. The system wasn’t as extensive as those offered by some other automakers, but it was simple and effective and a very good value. Infotainment suites are increasingly common, but it’s still impressive to see one in a car that’s priced below $20,000 before destination.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Driving the Forte felt pretty much like driving any other compact sedan. It’s not exciting, but it’s also not demanding. You can turn the key, point the car toward home, and forget you’re even driving. That’s not what I usually look for in a car, but for someone who just needs four wheels to get them to work and back, the Forte will be exactly right. The 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine makes 173 horsepower, plenty for normal driving. The EPA rates this engine at 36 mpg on the highway and 24 mpg in the city. That’s about middle of the pack (or even a little lower) compared with the Forte’s competition. A 1.8-liter, 148-horsepower four-cylinder, offered on the Forte’s lower LX trim, gets one extra city mile per gallon when outfitted with an automatic transmission.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>The Verdict:</h3>\r\nI wasn’t expecting to be impressed by or interested in the Forte, but Kia surprised me. This vehicle does a good job of providing drivability, technology, and style in an affordable package. It’s exactly the combination of features that young people buying their first car are looking for. But the Forte’s got a lot of competition. Would I choose a Kia Forte over a Mazda 3 or a Volkswagen Jetta? Probably not. For my money, both of those vehicles are more stylish and more fun to drive. That’s enough to make me cough up for their larger price tags. But there are people out there who will choose the Forte, and they’re not wrong.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2014 kia forte","caption":"","fileMasterId":56189081,"fileName":"kia_forte_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56189081/kia_forte_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":817},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1286}},"order":8,"text":"<h3>Peanut Gallery:</h3>\n<strong>Molly Jean:</strong> The Kia Forte looks great, and at $20,315, it makes sense for the pocketbook, too.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Lunacy","id":1034778,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-lunacy","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-12T12:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"whatidrove_11_12_homepage","title":"what i drove nov 11","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57160415/whatidrove-11-12-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":57160415,"fileName":"whatidrove-11-12-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-12T12:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"whatidrove_11_12_homepage","title":"what i drove nov 11","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57160415/whatidrove-11-12-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":57160415,"fileName":"whatidrove-11-12-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":590546,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"All was quiet on the home front.

I found the Monroney sticker, and sure enough, it has 240 horsepower and a whopping 406 pound-feet of torque, which is that fantastic, dynamic twisting motion that, when you have a lot of it, feels like it’s propelling the car almost out from under your seat.  The horrifying thing on the Monroney was the price. Yes, the Touareg is quite lovely, and this R-Line version included all-wheel drive, a sport suspension, twenty-inch wheels, really gorgeous pebbly black leather seats, a beautiful panoramic sunroof (which, by the way, had a disturbing little rattle this morning all the way to the Interstate), and an extensive list of luxuries, all included in the price. That price, by the way, is $13,720 more than a base Touareg, for a total of $58,560. Holy Moses. I figured $50,000, but almost $60,000? Wow.

There was a broken-down pool table sitting in the middle of it. Over the years, my husband and his friends (and my cousin) have slowly turned it into the Taj Mahal of hunting camps, complete with a granite island, refrigerator, stove, a stovetop nicer than the stovetop in my own home, triple bunks, a potbelly stove, and when they got tired of getting up in the night to feed the stove, they installed a gas wall furnace. Last year, my husband lost his mind and had the 100-year-old barn floor sanded and polyurethaned. He just loved how it looked when they refinished our kitchen floor in the house. That's how he feels about his camp. The camp also has air conditioning so, in the summer, it’s Bob the Show Dog’s kennel to maintain his show-worthy coat, and in fact, Ray the Stray has now decided he prefers the hunting camp to his kennel, so he’s there every day sleeping in the bunks.

As a writer and publisher for BU’s online magazine, I wrote about politics and current events and wrote two series: Foxy Congressperson of the Week, which is exactly what it sounds like, and An American in Paris, detailing my misadventures abroad. \n\nGrowing up in Southeastern Michigan means that love of cars is practically a birthright, and one I’ve always been proud of.

Since there’s no difference in driving enjoyment or looks—and, for 2014, both start at similar base prices, $26,390 for the BRZ and $26.010 for the FR-S (including destination charges)—focus on feature availability. If you’re fine with the bare-bones treatment or are tight on cash, the Scion is for you. If you’d like a few more features and a couple of creature comforts, get yourself to a Subaru dealership.
