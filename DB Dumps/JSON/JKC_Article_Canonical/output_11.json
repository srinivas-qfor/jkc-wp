I tell them about my father, who was a Chrysler engineer, and the crazy cars he would bring home to test drive. But before I discovered the glamorous life of an automotive journalist, I was a writer living in the Motor City, covering music and art in the Nineties. Things changed when I became curious about the industry that made the city tick and interned at <em>AutoWeek </em>magazine. \n\nI moved to New York City in 2003, where I’ve worked as a freelance writer for almost a decade. I’ve written for more than 100 magazines, newspapers, and websites, including the New York <em>Times, Rolling Stone, Forbes, Jay-z’s Life and Times, Vibe, Automobile Magazine, AutoWeek</em> and the Detroit <em>Free Press.</em> I finished an MFA in creative writing at the New School this year. I live with two car buffs, Lee Quiñones and our four-year-old son, who both think what I do is pretty cool.","fileMasterId":39801671,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801671/39801671.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,10009,6202044,6202090]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-25T14:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"heels and wheels 2013","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48768733/heels-wheels-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":48768733,"fileName":"heels-wheels-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-25T14:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"heels and wheels 2013","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48768811/heels-wheels-header.jpg","fileMasterId":48768811,"fileName":"heels-wheels-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-25T14:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"heels and wheels 2013","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48768865/heels-wheels-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":48768865,"fileName":"heels-wheels-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":300},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":919}}},"pages":[{"id":469218,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"heels and wheels 2013","caption":"","fileMasterId":48768718,"fileName":"heels_wheels_12.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48768718/heels_wheels_12.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":0,"text":"As soon as I arrived in Portland, Oregon, for the third annual Heels and Wheels event, I jumped in a car and headed southeast. Cold rain obscured my view of Mount Hood from the windshield of the Aston Martin DB9. I wondered if the foul weather was going to put a damper on the event that brings together thirty women in the automotive industry to focus on car coverage for and by women. For the record, I was impressed with the way the DB9 handled the wet roads, although I confess that my knuckles were pale from gripping the wheel through the sharp bends. But suddenly, the landscape shifted dramatically, and I was cruising along smooth, dry roads in the Oregon desert, dotted by a backdrop of snow-capped mountains. At last, the accelerator and I were one as the driving euphoria kicked in, the scenery vast in the foreground. A caravan of women followed me onto the road, and suddenly I knew that Heels and Wheels was going to be fun.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"I pulled into a rest stop tucked within the boundaries of the Warm Springs Indian Reservation off U.S. 26. A man emerged from the rolling stream in waders, fishing pole in hand. We had officially left the city and found our way back to nature. I switched to my next ride, a Mazda 6 sedan, and sped along to my destination in central Oregon, passing by wild horses galloping out yonder. When I arrived at the Brasada Ranch, about twenty minutes from small-town civilization in Bend, I found myself nestled in some kind of wild western paradise. It felt like the right kind of environment for the ladies to kick up their heels.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"heels and wheels 2013","caption":"","fileMasterId":48768790,"fileName":"heels_wheels_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48768790/heels_wheels_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":2,"text":"The setting of Heels and Wheels set the tone of the conversations that occurred over three whirlwind days. We take it for granted that women have been writing about cars for some time now, best embodied by the careers of hall-of-famer Denise McCluggage and one woman who is the editor in chief of an influential automotive magazine and who shapes and defines the way men and women learn about, discover, and see cars. (We see you, Jean.)","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<strong>Yet, the idea that women read car magazines is still hard to sell to the mainstream.</strong> The idea of how to talk about women and cars is still being debated by marketers and car dealers on a daily basis. Yes, we women make most of the decisions about car ownership, but how do we expand the conversation? That’s where programs like Heels and Wheels become important. The auto industry is still overwhelmingly a boys’ club, and far too few women are a part of this conversation. It certainly doesn’t hurt to gather and discuss what car journalism for women means in the era of blogging and social media, and how the playing field is changing as the world around us does, too. Our media niches define us as consumers, whether we read mom blogs or hunt obsessively for automotive deals online. Sometimes our audiences don’t overlap, but often our intentions do. These themes came up in both formal and informal conversation at Brasada Ranch.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Also, as women know, an all-ladies trip is fun. Take women away from their busy lives and give them some open road and the chance to speak freely, and the soundtrack soon turns to laughter. The event organizer, Heels and Wheels CEO Christine Overstreet, opted to make the gathering more experiential than business specific. This format allowed for attendees to focus on their cars of choice. Overstreet invited presenters from AutoPacific, Kelley Blue Book, Jeep, and Cooper Tire to talk about ideas specific to the women’s market. Some of the information was familiar, but I picked up tidbits that were news to me. For instance, did you know that more women than men are licensed to drive (a fun fact presented by the representative from Cooper Tire)? Female representatives from Aston Martin, Buick, Hyundai, Jeep, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, and Volkswagen were in attendance to answer questions about the vehicles available for test drive and to contribute to the conversation. Jeep sent Chris Barman, vehicle line executive for Chrysler’s C and D segments, to talk about the 2014 Jeep Cherokee. She provided detailed explanations on matters of technology and interior options.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"heels and wheels 2013","caption":"","fileMasterId":48768604,"fileName":"heels_wheels_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48768604/heels_wheels_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":5,"text":"For many of the bloggers in attendance, Heels and Wheels was their first chance to test out the new vehicles.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

For that kind of money, I want to feel cosseted in luxury and prepared for anything, and I had both feelings while driving the Odyssey.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"You won’t be mistaken about whether you’re in a minivan or not. From the time you pull the door open, you are confronted by acres of plastic, which is only somewhat ameliorated by the leather seating. That cavernous feeling may be foreign to the person who is used to a small, sporty car, but it’s part of the roominess and versatility that a minivan is all about.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Driving it, you are also not mistaken about the size of the thing. You are driving a 4,500-pound, 16.9-foot-long van. Having said that, it accelerates nimbly, handles smoothly, and has light, intuitive steering—although almost too light for my comfort. I was driving across town in this Odyssey when a tremendous rain whipped up, flooding city streets in what was later called a once-in-fifty-year storm. The next day, the Ann Arbor<em> News</em> displayed photos and videos of people kayaking down side streets. I felt absolutely protected inside the Odyssey as I navigated around the city, seeking out the highest-sitting neighborhoods and avoiding the high water. The ability to calmly manage adverse conditions is a great test of any vehicle, and the Odyssey won my trust right then.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Among the can’t-live-without amenities that you’d get used to quickly are a “cool box” below the stereo controls, big enough to keep your Diet Coke and yogurt or a dozen juice boxes nice and cool while you drive; a truly tremendous number of places to plug in and charge (no more fights over the outlet up front; there are two); and the flip-up trash bag ring, solving the constant problem of a trash receptacle that doesn’t roll around on the floor of the van or get tipped over.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"The second-row seats roll forward and back into place, making it easy to gain access to the third row. The center seat in that row folds down into a center console for two passengers, eliminating fights about personal space. Don’t worry, they’ll think of something else to argue about!","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"The Odyssey comes in LX, EX, Touring, and Touring Elite trim levels. The 2014 model has just gone on sale, with pricing for the base model only about $150 higher than its 2013 counterpart, and all models now have a six-speed automatic transmission. (For 2013, only the Touring- and Touring Elite-level Odysseys did.) The Touring Elite model I drove has several features you don’t get on the entry-level model, but the base LX’s price is a reasonable $29,655 for 2014, including destination, and you still get the capable 248-horsepower V-6 and a whole lot of great safety and convenience features.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"There are several good reasons to spring for the higher-end Odyssey, though. The EX-L and Touring/Touring Elite models have the ultra-wide 16.2-inch rear DVD system, the high-end audio, that cool box up front, and, on the top Touring Elite for 2014, the awesome integrated vacuum (right) in the back. Less frivolously, they also have lane departure warning, forward collision warning, and a blind spot information system. I think a big reason to go out and buy a new car or minivan this year is that all these technologies are becoming available. There’s nothing a distracted minivan pilot needs more (besides a trip to Starbucks) than systems that help keep her as aware as possible and her passengers safer as a result.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<h3>The Verdict:</h3>\r\nIf I were shopping for a minivan right now, and price were no object, I would get one of the higher trim levels (Touring or Touring Elite) of the 2014 Odyssey without a backward glance. Then I’d enjoy finding ways to use all the seat configurations, the cup holders, the outlets, and the video capability while going on lots of long road trips in it. A minivan this versatile kind of makes you want to go out and have a bunch of kids, or start a band, or gather four or five old friends and go on a long, long drive.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<h3>Peanut Gallery:</h3>\r\n<strong>Molly:</strong> Love the design of the center instrument panel; the angle is perfect for quick access while keeping my eyes on the road. The navigation screen's location is perfect for actually reading the screen because it is not affected by glare, but it is really far away from the driver. I also liked the \"title\" button that brought up song titles, but I would prefer to have the radio screen integrated with the navigation screen.</br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<strong>Christina:</strong> If you're going to have a minivan, this is definitely the one to have. I love the way the seats slide back and forth and fold down by just pulling a lever or a strap. You can do almost everything with one hand! The rear visibility is fantastic, and the car is spacious enough to offer you and your passengers enough room to be comfortable, but not enough to feel like you're driving a yacht down the road. This one is a winner.</br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"<strong>Annie: </strong>I'm still a long way off from the <em>Married With Children</em> portion of my life, so it's hard for me to imagine a minivan as my car of choice. I wasn't a fan of the Odyssey's big, boat-like attitude, but I was duly impressed by the wide array of comfort features this top-of-the-line Odyssey offered. From a drink cooler built into the center console, to the dual-screen DVD player, to the acres and acres of space between passengers, it's easy to see why families fall for the Odyssey. Ask me again in ten years.</br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<strong>Scott:</strong> I took the Odyssey on a 150-mile round trip carrying my video equipment on the way there and the equipment for myself and another videographer on the way back. It was a lot of stuff. Everything fit snugly, and nothing was rolling around, yet there was still room for two passengers in the back. I have always driven Hondas and always liked them because they’re durable; you can run them into the ground. So maybe I’m biased, but I think the Odyssey is great.</br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"<strong>Jean: </strong> I like how refined all the controls are, especially for the people in the back. I don't personally like the video screen hanging down, because I can't bend my neck back like that without getting dizzy, and tilting the seat back, although a great feature, doesn't much help. If you're looking for a minivan, this Odyssey is great, but if you think adults will be comfortable looking at the screen in the second row, guess again. The video screen would be much better just in the back of the headrest, even for a kid.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite","fileMasterId":50235595,"fileName":"2013_Odyssey_Touring_05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50235595/2013_Odyssey_Touring_05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite","fileMasterId":50235667,"fileName":"2013_Odyssey_Touring_header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50235667/2013_Odyssey_Touring_header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite","fileMasterId":50235943,"fileName":"2013_Odyssey_Touring_07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50235943/2013_Odyssey_Touring_07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite interior","fileMasterId":50235601,"fileName":"2012_Odyssey_Touring_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50235601/2012_Odyssey_Touring_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite","fileMasterId":50235604,"fileName":"2012_Odyssey_Touring_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50235604/2012_Odyssey_Touring_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite with seats folded","fileMasterId":50235598,"fileName":"2012_Odyssey_Touring_04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50235598/2012_Odyssey_Touring_04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":351},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite","fileMasterId":50235475,"fileName":"2012_Odyssey_Touring_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50235475/2012_Odyssey_Touring_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":15,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20513,"make":"Honda","model":"Odyssey","year":2013},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":9},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:25:21.828-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547121829 }} },{ "_id":346678,"title":"2013 BMW X1 xDrive 28i","subTitle":"Not just for BMW fans","slug":"2013-bmw-x1-xdrive-28i","promoTitle":"2013 BMW X1 xDrive 28i","promoTeaserSmall":"A Favorite from our first year!

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-02T12:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"decoding your vin","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55345630/vin-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":55345630,"fileName":"vin-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-02T12:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"decoding your vin","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55345606/vin-header.jpg","fileMasterId":55345606,"fileName":"vin-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-02T12:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"decoding your vin","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55345612/vin-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":55345612,"fileName":"vin-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":517214,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"No math required, but I am going to be hurtling numbers at you, so be prepared to duck.

Better yet, with a starting price of $24,200 (although the one shown here started at a still reasonable $28,235), it won't take years of gas savings to make up the difference in price between a Prius and a similar traditional gasoline car.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2012 toyota prius four","caption":"","fileMasterId":58078350,"fileName":"2012_prius_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58078350/2012_prius_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":5,"text":"Of course, gas mileage that good comes at a cost, and in the case of the Prius, that cost is driving enjoyment. You won't get a thrill from pressing the accelerator, and I don't recommend throwing the Prius around tight corners. But for drivers who are just trying to get from Point A to Point B, the Prius's 1.8-liter 98-horsepower engine (which gets help from the small electric motor to make 134 horsepower under heavy acceleration) will be perfectly adequate. It's also a little addictive to try to drive as efficiently as possible.

The Prius v is for customers who think the Prius could stand to be just a little bigger, and while it doesn't get quite the gas mileage of its smaller siblings, it still does better than just about any non-hybrid vehicle at 44 mpg city and 40 mpg highway. The Prius Plug-in allows drivers to experience up to eleven miles of electric range, thanks to a slightly larger battery that can be fully charged in an hour and a half at a 240-volt outlet.

An expanded list of sizes and price points, plus Toyota quality and predictability, put the Prius into a very special position among hybrids. Who wants to argue with that? You say Prius drivers are self-satisfied? They <em>are</em> getting better fuel economy than most people. People drive too slow in the Prius? They're just trying to get even better fuel economy than they already are. The car is boring? Toyota doesn't make these things for the same people who buy the Porsche Boxster.

After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"New Car Features","id":1034782,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/new-car-features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-18T14:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 cadillac cts noise","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57685459/cadillac-sound-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":57685459,"fileName":"cadillac-sound-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-18T14:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 cadillac cts noise","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57685441/cadillac-sound-header.jpg","fileMasterId":57685441,"fileName":"cadillac-sound-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-18T14:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 cadillac cts noise","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57685459/cadillac-sound-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":57685459,"fileName":"cadillac-sound-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":543383,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Cadillac's Art and Science design philosophy now extends to the sounds you hear.

The tale has the advantage of being true; here's a photo of the two real-life stars on the track at Japan, the momentous last race of that championship season.<br>\n<br>\nScreenwriter Peter Morgan has crafted a gripping, colorful and sensitive story that combines the leanness of a good documentary with the fantasy of film.

What you see in the film is very close to what you get on a track. The film's R rating will probably keep you from taking your car-crazy ten-year-old to the theater, but that's okay.

Options on the Premium model include heated front seats (Comfort package, $650) and navigation (Electronics package, $2,340). The V6 models get their power from a 305-horsepower V-6 engine.

The interior wouldn’t pass muster in any other $37,000 car; it’s a study in black plastic. The $1,595 Recaro sport seats may keep driver and passenger from sliding around on tight corners, but they’re not particularly comfortable or attractive.

By the time I was in high school, 1960s muscle cars, especially Mustangs, gave their drivers a lot of street cred in my small rural hometown. In fact, I dated one guy specifically because he had a Mustang. (It was summer.) The interior of the 2014 Mustang GT has kept the candle burning for the original aesthetic, so much so that I think I can still smell smoke in the air. But, since the 2005 redesign, Ford has been honing this thoroughly modern Mustang. The choice of speedometer and rpm dials perfectly incorporates the design cues of the car's forefathers. I regret that I did not get to drive it at night to see them glow. The massive black dash seems sort of cheap in comparison with some modern materials that are available to designers, but I appreciate the nod to the old-school style. I believe that the choice of materials will help this car lend itself to being someone's collector Mustang.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2014 ford mustang gt","caption":"","fileMasterId":52395104,"fileName":"syb_fordmustang_07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52395104/syb_fordmustang_07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":11,"text":"<strong>Laura:</strong> My dad bought one of the first Mustangs in 1965.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

And the third-best news is that the Rogue is built on a new common platform from the Renault-Nissan Alliance that will be the basis of up to 2.3 million vehicles worldwide (including the European version of the Rogue, the X-Trail). Plus, the new Rogue, formerly assembled in Japan, now will be built right here in the U.S.A.: Smyrna, Tennessee.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2014 nissan rogue","caption":"","fileMasterId":57299551,"fileName":"nisssan_rogue_06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57299551/nisssan_rogue_06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":1,"text":"All of those bits of nice information almost (but not quite) cancel out the fact that Nissan Americas' vice-president for product planning,  Pierre Loing, called the Rogue's design a \"sonic pulse.\" That's just weird.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Sherman had brought along two friends to create a sort of Corvette corral, and we also had the gorgeously restored white 1957 Mercedes-Benz 190SL roadster belonging to Craig Layson, whose ownership of Stony Creek Collision, a spectacular body shop, makes him almost a member of the Automobile Magazine family.

It has Intelligent Brake Assist with Forward Collision Warning, so it will warn him if it senses danger ahead and, if he fails to respond to the warning, apply the brakes to reduce the severity of the crash. It will keep an eye on his blind spot and alert him to impending crashes—and, through its Blind Spot Intervention System, bring the car back into his lane if he is about to make a dangerous mistake. Which means that safety systems are number one on my list.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":" I want all of that technology keeping an eye on him and correcting his mistakes as he learns to drive. But a $40,000 luxury car for a teen’s first car? Out of the question. So how much safety can I buy without slipping into absurd helicopter parent territory? José Alberto Uclés of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration assures me I’m not likely to go overboard: “Safety should be a parent’s main concern when buying a car for a teen.” And he suggested I research any car Cole wants at Safercar.gov, which rates car safety by model with a star system. Forward collision warning systems, blind spot alerts, lane keeping assistance, and active technologies that brake or control the steering wheel when something is about to go terribly wrong are also on Ulczycki’s wish list for a teen car. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"“They are absolutely good safety devices,” he says. “And I am optimistic we will have these features in more vehicles in the near future.” So let's make the list of must-haves, starting with that:","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<strong>1. As much modern safety tech as we can afford.</strong> GM’s Sharon Basel says many warning systems—if not those that take active control of the vehicle—are available in affordable cars now. “There are cars at all price points equipped with forward collision sensing systems, lane departure warning, and blind zone alerts,” she says. “They have been out for a couple of years. So you might even find [these technologies] in a used car.” And if those are too expensive, there are simpler items, such as mirrors that amplify the blind spot, available in the aftermarket.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<strong>2. A big-enough car.</strong> Technology is not the only criterion. “Safety starts with the size of the vehicle,” says   Ulczycki. “Bigger cars withstand impact better.

The right amount of power.</strong> That muscle car Cole is shopping for? A bad idea. “Avoid horsepower,” says   Ulczycki. “If he has a car that can go fast, he will probably drive it fast.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<strong>4. A newer model.</strong> At the moment, Cole is driving our 1996 minivan. It’s big and gutless. So I wondered, would he be safer if I withdrew my offer to match his savings for a newer car? “Not when it comes to safety,” says Ulczycki. “Forty years ago, there wasn’t much difference in safety between old cars and new ones. But today, you have only to go back five years to find a huge difference.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"Okay.

Airbags for the driver and side curtain airbags for the passengers.</strong> “Even though teens aren’t supposed to carry passengers, they often do,” says Ulczycki. “So keep them safe, too.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<strong>6. Electronic stability control.</strong> Kids swerve to pass a vehicle, take sharp turns around corners, and overcorrect. Electronic stability control helps minimize the loss of control. “I believe it prevents crashes and the seriousness of crashes,” he says.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"<strong>7. A teen harassment system.</strong> “Teens don’t wear seatbelts,” he says.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I know driving is dangerous for teens because I’ve seen the numbers: Thirty-five percent of all teenage deaths happen behind the wheel. I also know my son: He is a very distracted teen. Even without a smartphone, earbuds, friends texting him, hilarious YouTube videos, and mobile games in the palm of his hand, he’s always been a bit of a “lost in thought” space case. And eleven percent of all drivers under the age of twenty involved in fatal crashes were distracted at the time. So he and I have talked at length about distracted (and drunk) driving.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Funny thing: I haven't been worried when he <em>walks</em> away.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"It turns out I should worry more about his distracted walking, which has more than once caused him to walk into furniture at home. Safekids.org recently published a study detailing how dangerous this common behavior is. According to this report, one in five high school students and one in eight middle school students were observed crossing the street while distracted by technology. I guess it’s not that surprising that pedestrian injuries are the fifth leading cause of injury-related death in the United States for children ages five to nineteen. And given how many teenagers have a smartphone, they are at greatest risk. According to SafeKids.org, “Teens have a death rate twice that of younger children and account for half of all child pedestrian deaths.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>1. Talk to Your Daughters and Sons</h3>\nAs a parent, I obviously need to talk to my son (and my not-yet-driving daughter) about this very dangerous habit right along with all the other risky teen behaviors, like alcohol, sex, drugs, guns, and driving, because statistically this is more dangerous than teen pregnancy or gun violence.

Realize That Anyone Could Be Walking while Distracted</h3> \nThis study focused on teens. But, according to John Ulczycki, vice-president of strategic initiatives at the National Safety Council: “This could just as easily apply to adults because they are just as distracted. Teens tend to text and play games while walking, but adults are talking on the phone. And the difference in how distracted people are by those activities is negligible.” Ulczycki explains that you can do some things (chew gum, for example) while walking and still focus on walking. But anything that presents a “cognitive distraction\"—and all these activities do—means you will not see what is right in front of you. So I guess I have to start driving as if I’m living in a zombie apocalypse--one, that is, where I desperately don’t want to hurt any of the zombies?","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>3. Don’t Assume They Can See You</h3>\nYes. And I can't begin to overstate the zombies’ lack of awareness of the world around them. There may have been a time when I could assume that if someone looked right at my car, they saw it and were likely to do their best to avoid being hit by it. But—in the zombie apocalypse—you can’t make that assumption. A person who is “cognitively distracted,” as Ulczycki describes it, might look right at you and not see you at all. “Their mind is occupied by something else,” he explains. “They are looking but not seeing. Psychologists call this ‘inattention blindness.’ ”","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"driving in a zombie apocalypse","caption":"","fileMasterId":58176610,"fileName":"distracted_pedestrian_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58176610/distracted_pedestrian_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":6,"text":"<h3>4. And Know That They Might Be Jaywalking</h3>\nAccording to the Highway Safety Research Center, jaywalking is also a huge problem. So I can’t assume that distracted pedestrians are planning to stay safely on the sidewalk. If I’m in a school zone or a residential area, I have to assume that pedestrians can’t hear my vehicle because they might be wearing earbuds, and they can’t see me because they are cognitively distracted. It's also important to assume they have no intention of obeying the rules. Better to be pleasantly surprised.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>5. As for You: Don’t<em> Drive</em> Distracted</h3>\nAll this is challenging enough for a driver. But if that driver is also distracted by a phone call, a text, or the phone’s navigation software, it’s a perfect storm in which someone is very likely to get hurt. I may not be able to stop those teenagers from walking distracted, but I can put my own phone down when I’m behind the wheel and pay careful attention to the zombie apocalypse that’s happening outside my vehicle. And so can you.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h3>Related story:</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/cool-tech/honda-helping-cars/\" target=\"_blank\">Honda Helping Cars Spot Walkers</a> September 25, 2013<br>","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":7},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:25:37.902-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547137903 }} },{ "_id":405626,"title":"Save Your Car from the Kids: 5 Tips","subTitle":"","slug":"save-your-car-from-kids","promoTitle":"Save Your Car from the Kids: 5 Tips","promoTeaserSmall":"Reality-based cleaning!

Always have a place for trash disposal.</h3>\nI have observed that children are willing to be tidy if there is an easy, simply understandable way of cleaning up. You can’t expect little kids to fold their disposable trash into neat quarters and carry it in to the house. Big kids, maybe (but probably not). You <em>can</em> expect them to stuff gum wrappers and junk into the fabric map pockets on the back of the seats, where you'll find it a month later, if you don't have a better option that's just as easy.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"So have a trash bag, such as one of those thin plastic store bags with handles, right at hand.

If you spend any amount of time with them, whether taking road trips or just going to after-school music lessons and then soccer practice, they will at least snack in the car. But there are ways to reduce the mess. I always have small kitchen towels on board, and I hand out one per person for their laps and to use as napkins. The towels go into my wet/dirty storage once used, and they have saved the upholstery and my kids’ clothes many times. I also attempt to have everyone eat and then dispose of the trash all in one stop.

Yes, you can assign your children to take turns cleaning out the car, or stand over them while they remove all their stuff each day. And you should. But to really get that clean-car feeling, the most workable solution I have found over many years is to make it an activity I do for myself, alone. I go off on a Saturday or Sunday, without any kids, and I go through a car wash, vacuum out the car, and get out the Windex and Mr. Clean wipes to freshen the surfaces and get the finger marks off the side windows.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

EV mode, where the Accord Hybrid runs on power from the battery alone, can last up to a couple of miles in city driving, and once the battery is depleted the car will automatically switch back to Hybrid mode, where the electric motors get a boost from the Accord Hybrid’s 141-horsepower 2.0-liter engine.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"With all its various technologies, talk of the Accord Hybrid can get a little academic.

Even with those marks against it, the 2014 Honda Accord Hybrid seems poised to take the hybrid market by storm.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2014 honda accord","caption":"","fileMasterId":58749013,"fileName":"Accord_Hybrid_EX-L_05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58749013/Accord_Hybrid_EX-L_05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":12,"text":"<h3>2014 Honda Accord Hybrid</h3>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $29,845  <br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle DOHC I-4, 141 horsepower, 122 pound-feet of torque;<br>\nTotal hybrid system power 196 hp<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Electric continuously variable (E-CVT)<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 50 mpg city/45 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Eight-inch driver information display with fuel efficiency data<br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Leather-trimmed seats (standard in EX-L and Touring models)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Ford Fusion Hybrid, Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, Toyota Camry Hybrid<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Honda Accord Hybrid in San Antonio.","fileMasterId":54640097,"fileName":"Accord_Hybrid_EX-L_07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54640097/Accord_Hybrid_EX-L_07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Engine compartment, 2014 Honda Accord Hybrid.","fileMasterId":54640346,"fileName":"2014-honda-accord_09.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54640346/2014-honda-accord_09.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Honda Accord Hybrid","fileMasterId":58749103,"fileName":"2014-honda-accord_08.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58749103/2014-honda-accord_08.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Honda Accord Hybrid","fileMasterId":54640082,"fileName":"Accord_Hybrid_EX-L_04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54640082/Accord_Hybrid_EX-L_04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Honda Accord Hybrid","fileMasterId":54640085,"fileName":"Accord_Hybrid_EX-L_06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54640085/Accord_Hybrid_EX-L_06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Honda Accord Hybrid","fileMasterId":54640016,"fileName":"Accord_Hybrid_EX-L_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54640016/Accord_Hybrid_EX-L_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Honda Accord Hybrid","fileMasterId":58749013,"fileName":"Accord_Hybrid_EX-L_05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58749013/Accord_Hybrid_EX-L_05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":13,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":36138,"make":"Honda","model":"Accord","year":2014},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":1},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:25:40.262-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547140264 }} },{ "_id":406671,"title":"What I Drove Last Weekend!","subTitle":"","slug":"what-i-drove-oct-14","promoTitle":"What I Drove Last Weekend!","promoTeaserSmall":"I drove 27 cars last week, but one look at the 2014 Mercedes-Benz S550 and I wanted to keep driving.","promoTeaser":"I drove 27 cars last week, but one look at the 2014 Mercedes-Benz S550 and I wanted to keep driving.","keywords":["What I Drove"],"metaTitle":"What I Drove Last Weekend!

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Lunacy","id":1034778,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-lunacy","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"about","id":1035130,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean/about","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-14T18:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Mercedes Benz S550","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60084555/Mercedes-Flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":60084555,"fileName":"Mercedes-Flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":648}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-14T18:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Mercedes Benz S550","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60084558/Mercedes-Header.jpg","fileMasterId":60084558,"fileName":"Mercedes-Header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":624}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-14T18:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Mercedes Benz S550","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60084555/Mercedes-Flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":60084555,"fileName":"Mercedes-Flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":648}}},"pages":[{"id":546349,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"On Wednesday and Thursday of last week, I drove a Porsche Cayman S, and then I drove twenty-six other cars.

Motorcycle rider training not only reduces your chances of getting into an accident, it's correlated with reduced injuries in the event of an accident, according to the Hurt Report, the classic major motorcycle safety study. Motorcycles account for twelve percent of U.S. road fatalities, even though they make up less than one percent of vehicle miles travelled overall.

Don't feel pressured to buy a first bike that's too large.</strong> It's tempting, when first starting on a bike, to buy the dream bike that inspired you to want to ride in the first place. Resist that temptation. More than half of the motorcyclists who have accidents have owned the bike on which they had that accident less than five months, so buy a beater bike instead. Start with a used 250- or 300-cc machine, and ride it for six months first. Doing so will build your confidence and your skills and will also save you money that's easily recouped by selling that bike when you've reached your six-month milestone. And it's likely to save you costly repair bills from dumping your dream bike early on. It might even save your life.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<strong>4.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-01T08:06:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup_header_real2","title":"weekly windup 11 1","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60701881/windup-header-real2.jpg","fileMasterId":60701881,"fileName":"windup-header-real2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-01T08:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup_nov1_header","title":"weekly windup 11 1","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60703735/windup-nov1-header.jpg","fileMasterId":60703735,"fileName":"windup-nov1-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-01T08:06:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup_header_real2","title":"weekly windup 11 1","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60701881/windup-header-real2.jpg","fileMasterId":60701881,"fileName":"windup-header-real2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":571473,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Here's this week's blend of crazy art, brilliant marketing, questionable ideas, and fun things to click on.

Where other small sedans in the Impreza’s class are making great strides in modernizing and adding technology, this car is holding fast to the good old days.

What Jean called a sewing-machine-like sound (below) was not at all like a \"normal\" inline four-cylinder engine sounds like, let me put it that way. On the other hand, get the Impreza onto the highway, and it’s surprisingly peppy and able for a four-cylinder engine that makes 148 horsepower.

Starting as a way to market higher-end used cars, the Certified Pre-Owned designation has now become commonplace at car dealerships. A Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) car is generally a car with a clean history, few past users, of relatively recent vintage, and with less than about 80,000 miles on the odometer. It undergoes an extensive pre-sale inspection, and problems are fixed before it's offered for sale. What's not to like? Of course, all of this means that your average CPO car is sold at a premium, but for the peace of mind you get, it is often well worth the cost.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"If you are interested in a used-car purchase, here are five things to know about CPO.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Cpo 01","caption":"","fileMasterId":69118818,"fileName":"cpo-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69118818/cpo-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2702},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":4254}},"order":2,"text":"1.\t<strong>Used cars aren't just for those who can’t afford new anymore.</strong> CPOs are increasingly popular among premium brands.

Brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, and Cadillac all have firmly established CPO programs, and even Porsche sold more than 800 CPOs in January 2014.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Fast Women","id":1034957,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/fast-women","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-26T09:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-homepage","title":"rosie the riveter reunion","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63783612/rosie-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63783612,"fileName":"rosie-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-26T09:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-header","title":"rosie the riveter reunion","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63783609/rosie-header.jpg","fileMasterId":63783609,"fileName":"rosie-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-26T09:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-homepage","title":"rosie the riveter reunion","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63783612/rosie-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63783612,"fileName":"rosie-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":592030,"metaDescription":"300-word story with photos -- Rosie the Riveter group getting together socially and talking about their lives since working at Willow Run during World War II","metaKeywords":["fast-women"],"metaTitle":"Rosie the Riveter Reunion","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Military Appreciation Night at the USA Hockey game: this was not going to be a typical game.

Around 2011, that all changed, and we are now told that age two is much safer for children. But Volvo is no latecomer to the rear-facing mandate: It made its first rear-facing child seat concept in 1967. The reason? Because children's heads are heavy relative to their young bodies, and their necks and vertebrae are not fully developed, so they can be injured more easily when facing forward in the event of a crash.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"Fun facts: Volvo thinks <em>everyone</em> riding in a car would be safer if they faced backward.

At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Lunacy","id":1034778,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-lunacy","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-27T08:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"homepage-what-i-drove","title":"Homepage What I Drove","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62249917/Homepage-What-I-Drove.jpg","fileMasterId":62249917,"fileName":"Homepage-What-I-Drove.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-27T08:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mb-header-wid","title":"MB Header WID","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57666161/MB-Header-WID.jpg","fileMasterId":57666161,"fileName":"MB-Header-WID.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":624}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-27T08:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"homepage-what-i-drove","title":"Homepage What I Drove","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62249917/Homepage-What-I-Drove.jpg","fileMasterId":62249917,"fileName":"Homepage-What-I-Drove.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}}},"pages":[{"id":592041,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"what i drove last weekend 11 26","caption":"","fileMasterId":63801069,"fileName":"backup.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63801069/backup.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"<h3>In Which I Put in Play Virtually Every Vehicle in the Driveway</h3>\nWhat happened to the weather in Michigan while I was at the Los Angeles Auto Show?!?

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-05T14:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-12","title":"the weekly windup 12 6","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62716378/ww-12.6.2013-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62716378,"fileName":"ww-12.6.2013-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-05T14:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-12","title":"the weekly windup 12 6","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62716375/ww-12.6.2013-header.jpg","fileMasterId":62716375,"fileName":"ww-12.6.2013-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-05T14:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-12","title":"the weekly windup 12 6","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62716378/ww-12.6.2013-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62716378,"fileName":"ww-12.6.2013-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":593243,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>1.</strong> Time for a vacation: Book a ticket <a href=\"http://www.wallpaper.com/art/photographer-fabian-oefner-tricks-the-eye-at-mad-gallery-in-geneva/7010#91004\" title=\"Wallpaper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">to Geneva.</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"or <a href=\"http://www.wallpaper.com/art/full-throttle-a-fleet-of-supercharged-art-cars-goes-on-show-in-miami/7017\" title=\"Miami\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miami.</a> <br>\n<br>\nOr both, and celebrate cars as art.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

As a young adult I kicked around motor-racing, training to drive while I worked at a Brands Hatch satellite in Miami.  I've been race staff at the Detroit Grand Prix, worked TV coverage of Formula 1, Indy and NASCAR and done the occasional ride and drive program.  Eventually my racing aspirations gave way to a long held interest in filmmaking and I got my B.A. from the University of Michigan's burgeoning film program.  U of M taught me to write and introduced me to my excellent husband.  We spent five adventurous years in Los Angeles in the entertainment and publishing industries before returning to Ann Arbor where our lovely daughter came into the world.

As the company describes it, the report measures satisfaction at \"the customer relationship level.\" The top two car brands this year: Mercedes-Benz and Honda, based on satisfaction levels of recent car buyers. <br>\n<br>\nIt's a little different from the better-known J.D. Power and Associates reports, which rank consumer experience with specific models. This is the first time the Ann Arbor, Michigan, company has issued The ForeSee Experience Index (FXI), which uses a set of complex data gathered from over 25,000 surveys across the top 100 brands in seven industries, including the automotive industry, as a way to quantify how customers feel about those brands.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"ForeSee questioned panels of 200 to 250 recent auto buyers, grouped together by the vehicle brand they own.  Larry S. Freed, President and CEO of ForeSee, explains, “We look at a model of customer satisfaction that includes price, product, and service: Is the cost fair? Does the product meet expectations? Is service at a high level, meaning, are companies keeping their promises?” <br>\n<br>\nMercedes and Honda scored highest in satisfaction with a rating of 85; Ford and Toyota followed with 83, while Hyundai, BMW, Chevrolet, and Audi each scored 82 points. Trailing a few points behind were Nissan and Volkswagen at 79 and Kia with a 78.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"ForeSee also listed the top priorities for auto brands. For many manufacturers, price has the biggest impact on customer satisfaction: \"the products provide value and are worth the price.\" Among those are top-scoring Honda, but also low-scoring Kia and Volkswagen. Service (\"the company keeps its promises...the employees are friendly\") had the biggest impact on satisfaction at BMW and Nissan, among others. For the high-scoring Mercedes-Benz, having \"desirable, unique\" products was the essential element in customer satisfaction.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"“Satisfaction is a lot about expectations” is Freed’s message to automakers. “Expectations of a BMW are going to be very different than a Kia.” When tabulating the FXI score, ForeSee takes these perceptions into account, acknowledging that buyers assess a product's value according how they view the brand. <br>\n<br>\nThis is all very interesting, but it's also good news for us. We as consumers stand to benefit when auto companies have a deeper and more nuanced understanding of what drives our buying habits.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<em>Photos courtesy of Rick Case Honda and Hoehn Mercedes</em>","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:26:07.570-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547167571 }} },{ "_id":453366,"title":"Dog-Friendly Hotels You'll Like","subTitle":"","slug":"dog-friendly-hotels","promoTitle":"Dog-Friendly Hotels You'll Like","promoTeaserSmall":"No Heartworm Hotel jokes, please; these luxury spots welcome your pet and are nice for you, too.","promoTeaser":"No Heartworm Hotel jokes, please; these luxury spots welcome your pet and are nice for you, too.","keywords":["Dog-Friendly Hotels You'll Like"],"metaTitle":"Dog-Friendly Hotels You'll Like","metaKeywords":["dog hotels","dog-friendly hotels","hotels that allow pets","Affinia","PetFriendlyAccommodations"],"metaDescription":"Dog-Friendly Hotels You'll Like: No Heartworm Hotel jokes, please; these luxury spots not only permit but welcome your pet.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact.

The F-150 came with an optional bed extender, which cost $250 and allowed me to drive with the tailgate down and my cargo secured with a locking gate.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"f150 road trip","caption":"","fileMasterId":59178176,"fileName":"ford-f150-06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59178176/ford-f150-06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":5,"text":"With the bed extender in place, my mattress just fit in the truck bed.

At first, all was well. But then, the navigation system started getting confused about my location. Although I never left the highway, it showed me traveling down a side road parallel to the freeway and issued repeated voice commands urging me to return to I-94 West at the earliest possible convenience.

The F-150 didn’t get fantastic fuel mileage – my average hovered just above 15 mpg for most of my trip, though its V-6 EcoBoost engine is rated at 21 mpg on the highway, but the thirty-six-gallon fuel tank meant that pesky fuel stops were limited.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-20T11:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"12","title":"weekly windup 12 20","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65602005/12.20.2013-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65602005,"fileName":"12.20.2013-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-20T11:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"12","title":"weekly windup 12 20","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65601999/12.20.2013-header.jpg","fileMasterId":65601999,"fileName":"12.20.2013-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-20T11:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"12","title":"weekly windup 12 20","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65602005/12.20.2013-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65602005,"fileName":"12.20.2013-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":595475,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Tom Salt is one of the very best car photographers in the world, but apparently he is also a damn good videographer.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show.

I tell them about my father, who was a Chrysler engineer, and the crazy cars he would bring home to test drive. But before I discovered the glamorous life of an automotive journalist, I was a writer living in the Motor City, covering music and art in the Nineties. Things changed when I became curious about the industry that made the city tick and interned at <em>AutoWeek </em>magazine. \n\nI moved to New York City in 2003, where I’ve worked as a freelance writer for almost a decade. I’ve written for more than 100 magazines, newspapers, and websites, including the New York <em>Times, Rolling Stone, Forbes, Jay-z’s Life and Times, Vibe, Automobile Magazine, AutoWeek</em> and the Detroit <em>Free Press.</em> I finished an MFA in creative writing at the New School this year.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other.

After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-02T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevy-sonic-homepage-copy-copy","title":"chevy sonic 01","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64162834/chevy-sonic-homepage-copy-copy.jpg","fileMasterId":64162834,"fileName":"chevy-sonic-homepage-copy-copy.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-02T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevy-sonic-header","title":"chevy sonic 01","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64162831/chevy-sonic-header.jpg","fileMasterId":64162831,"fileName":"chevy-sonic-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-02T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevy-sonic-homepage-copy-copy","title":"chevy sonic 01","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64162834/chevy-sonic-homepage-copy-copy.jpg","fileMasterId":64162834,"fileName":"chevy-sonic-homepage-copy-copy.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":595674,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Price:</strong> $20,405 as tested (including destination) <br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 1.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, 138 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed manual<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 29 mpg city/40 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Heated, power-adjustable side mirrors<br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Chevrolet MyLink with voice recognition for phone and Bluetooth streaming audio ($200)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Ford Fiesta, Hyundai Accent, Nissan Versa<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>What I Think:</h3>\nI first became acquainted with the Chevrolet Sonic when my mother bought one last year, passing her four-year-old Saturn Astra down to me.

If you do get a little wrapped up in changing the radio station, though, the available forward collision alert and lane departure warning systems (in the advanced safety package, $395) could save you. Those warning lights are oddly placed, positioned atop the center stack right above the infotainment system.

There is a lot of hard plastic, but it looks not only well designed but also capable of holding up for many years without showing wear.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-31T11:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blooper-homepage-2","title":"outtakes reel 2013","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60072935/blooper-homepage-2.png","fileMasterId":60072935,"fileName":"blooper-homepage-2.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-31T11:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blooper-header-2","title":"outtakes reel 2013","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60072932/blooper-header-2.png","fileMasterId":60072932,"fileName":"blooper-header-2.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-31T11:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blooper-homepage-2","title":"outtakes reel 2013","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60072935/blooper-homepage-2.png","fileMasterId":60072935,"fileName":"blooper-homepage-2.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":595824,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"adSetCode":"","alignment":"block","autoPlay":0,"description":"","disableAdPreRoll":false,"embedCode":"<object classid='clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000' id='ooyalaPlayer' width='0' height='0'codebase='http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/swflash.cab'><param name='movie' value='http://www.ooyala.com/player.swf' /><param name='bgcolor' value='#000000' /><param name='wmode' value='Transparent'/><param name='allowScriptAccess' value='always' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><param name='flashvars' value='embedCode=VsNGhiajp2ACGmk93u32JVIx7V2R16mb&autoplay=0&loop=0&browserPlacement=4&width=0&height=0&wmode=Transparent' /><embed src='http://www.ooyala.com/player.swf' bgcolor='#000000' width='0' height='0' name='ooyalaPlayer' wmode='Transparent' align='middle' play='0' loop='0' allowscriptaccess='always' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowfullscreen='true' flashvars='embedCode=VsNGhiajp2ACGmk93u32JVIx7V2R16mb&autoplay=0&loop=0&browserPlacement=4&width=0&height=0&wmode=Transparent' pluginspage='http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer'> </embed></object>","height":0,"loop":0,"maintainAspectRatio":true,"ooyalaId":"1_5rp064dy","thumbnailUrl":"https://cfvod.kaltura.com/p/1807801/sp/180780100/thumbnail/entry_id/1_5rp064dy/version/100000/acv/151","transparency":"transparent","videoLength":158000,"width":0,"type":"video"},{"order":12,"text":"Here is a selection of some of our favorite moments during video shoots in 2013.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-2-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664358/insurance-2-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67664358,"fileName":"insurance-2-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-2-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664358/insurance-2-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67664358,"fileName":"insurance-2-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-2-header","title":"insurance tip no 2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664355/insurance-2-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67664355,"fileName":"insurance-2-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-2-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664358/insurance-2-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67664358,"fileName":"insurance-2-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":616266,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Most consumers tend to approach auto insurance with an eye to the vehicle insured. What’s the deductible? Would my repairs be covered in the event of an accident?  There are, however, four components to insurance. The first two involve the vehicle, of course, but the second two help <em>you</em> by protecting you financially. My agent, Nathan Lamb, whom you may have met in last week's <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-driving-tips/insurance-checkup-time/ \" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Insurance Checkup Time</a>, explained it all this way. <em>It's important to note that I live in Michigan, one of twelve states with \"no fault\" laws governing the way auto coverage works.

Collision Coverage</h3>\r\nCollision insurance, as its name implies, covers you if you hit something. If you’re at fault, your rating will be affected, likely making future coverage more expensive. The type of collision coverage you chose will depend on a variety of factors, including the age of the car and your tolerance for risk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n In Michigan, a “no fault” state (offerings vary state by state), there are three types of collision coverage.<br>\r\n<ul><strong>1. Regular collision</strong> pays for damage to your car from an accident. Regardless of who is at fault, you are responsible for the deductible.<br>\r\n<strong>2. Broad collision</strong> also pays for damage to your car from an accident. It absolves you of paying the deductible if you are not more than 50 percent at fault.<br>\r\n<strong>3. Limited collision</strong> coverage says that, if you’re at fault, the policy won't cover you at all; if the other party is at fault, your insurance covers the damage, although you still have to pay the deductible.</ul>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>2. Comprehensive Coverage</h3>\"Comprehensive\" insurance covers acts of God, things like hail damage, a tree falling on your car, or a deer trying to jump in for a ride.

Property Protection (PPI)</h3> Property protection insurance covers damage to other people's property. Say you blow a tire driving down Main Street, lose control, and hit someone’s front porch. That’s when property damage coverage comes into play.  In Michigan, the state minimum is $10,000; most insurers recommend coverage for $1 million.The increase in coverage generally costs only a couple of dollars a month, and, think about it, $10,000 doesn’t cover you for much if you’ve inadvertently done structural damage to the house when you \"parked\" on the porch.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>4. Residual Liability</h3> This coverage, known as Residual Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability insurance, covers you if you are found responsible or get sued as the result of an accident. In Michigan, the state minimum follows the 20/40 rule; you must have coverage for $20,000 per person and up to $40,000 per accident. Such minimal coverage, however, does not protect you from what Nathan calls “the Worst Day” event.  Black ice prevents you from stopping at an intersection and when you slide through, you hit a car with four occupants, causing injury, or God forbid, death.  You are at fault; they sue and win a $250,000 judgment per passenger. You are now responsible for $1 million.  Under 20/40, which may have seemed the best option because of the minimal monthly premium, you are covered for only $40,000. The other $960,000? Your responsibility, and you could work for rest of your life, with 25 percent of your wages garnished, until you have settled that debt.  Check your liability.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-11T17:22:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"altima-homepage","title":"2014 nissan altima","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823333/altima-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66823333,"fileName":"altima-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-11T17:22:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"altima-header","title":"2014 nissan altima","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823330/altima-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66823330,"fileName":"altima-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-11T17:22:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"altima-homepage","title":"2014 nissan altima","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823333/altima-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66823333,"fileName":"altima-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":617882,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2014 Nissan Altima 2.5 SL</h3>\n<strong>Price:</strong> $28,550 (base price of this model, including destination)<br>\n$30,625 as tested (including destination)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.5-liter four-cylinder, 182 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Continuously variable (CVT)<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 27 mpg city/38 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Heated leather-wrapped steering wheel<br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Lane departure warning (part of $1,090 Technology package)<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Easy Fill Tire Alert, remote start<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Blind spot warning, land departure warning, moving object detection, and a navigation system, all included in the $1,090 Technology package; Moonroof ($800)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Toyota Camry<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2014 nissan altima","caption":"","fileMasterId":66823312,"fileName":"altima-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823312/altima-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":1,"text":"I associate Nissan with slightly quirky design—think Cube, Juke, Leaf, and even Murano.

Genius.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2014 nissan altima","caption":"","fileMasterId":66823315,"fileName":"altima-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823315/altima-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":6,"text":"<strong>During the snowy week when we tested the Altima,</strong> I was glad to have the SL, which comes standard with a triumvirate of heated features: front seats, steering wheel, and outside mirrors.

I like to interview them, learn about their lives, photograph them, and write their stories. The people at Jean Knows Cars noticed me through my project, Humans of Ann Arbor. In that project, I tool around the city of Ann Arbor, introducing myself to anyone who draws my eye. If they are open to it, I take a photo of them and hear a little bit about them. Then I post the photos and stories on Facebook. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/HumansofAnnArbor\" rel=\"”nofollow”\" target=\"”_blank”\">Humans  of Ann  Arbor</a>  has followers from all over the world who check in on a daily basis to see ordinary people and their extraordinary stories.\n\nI have been studying people since I was a little girl in Missouri. Where I grew up, studying people often led you to the cars they loved. My grandpa had a gas station in Claycomo, Missouri, which he opened in the 1950s, and he passed his love of cars and taking care of the people who drove them down to my dad. Dad was a mechanic and a service supervisor all his life. We had a steady barrage of cars coming into our lives…mostly Chevys. To impress my dad, I learned to identify every car I could, and I used to name the cars while we drove down the road. Car culture is big in Missouri. Would you believe that I had friends who were sisters named Nova and Chevelle? If\nyou didn’t grow up the way I did, you might not get the significance of that, but suffice it to say that my people love their cars.\n\nThe car I adored most was the Chevrolet Corvair my dad gave me when I was in high school. It spent more time in my dad's shop than it did on the road, but in those moments when it was drivable, I knew what it was to love a car. It was a thing of beauty: pale cream with a plaid madras interior. I loved the sound and feel of the engine…it was more like a soft purr than a roar. I can still remember how it smelled and what it was like to drive it with the windows rolled down on a warm day. I've had lots of cars since then, and I loved some of them, too. But the Corvair was my first car love and will always be my favorite.\n\nAfter high school, I drove my car to Springfield, Missouri, to study communications at Missouri State. Later, I drove a different car to Chicago to study photography at Columbia College. I worked in Chicago as a freelance photographer and studio manager for many years before moving to Ann Arbor, where I continue to do freelance photography. I am excited about combining my love of studying people with my interest in cars. I want to explore how cars serve us, how they are intertwined in our lives, and what makes us love them. I can't wait to let you know what I find out.","fileMasterId":66360111,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66360111/66360111.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-10T12:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pinball-homepage","title":"ford pinball game","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68341107/pinball-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68341107,"fileName":"pinball-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-10T12:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pinball-header","title":"ford pinball game","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61997747/pinball-header.jpg","fileMasterId":61997747,"fileName":"pinball-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-10T12:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pinball-homepage","title":"ford pinball game","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68341107/pinball-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68341107,"fileName":"pinball-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":635712,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Don’t tell my kid, but before the term “screen time” was coined I spent a huge chunk of my\nchildhood playing video games and pinball in my neighborhood arcade.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-13T12:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"valentine-homepage","title":"our valentine playlist","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66919222/valentine-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66919222,"fileName":"valentine-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-13T12:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"valentine-header","title":"our valentine playlist","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66919219/valentine-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66919219,"fileName":"valentine-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-13T12:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"valentine-homepage","title":"our valentine playlist","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66919222/valentine-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66919222,"fileName":"valentine-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":635933,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Time flies.

The newest study to suggest that people under the age of thirty-five like and want cars comes from Enterprise Holdings, the rental-car company. It says that young people are often inspired to start shopping for a new vehicle after a positive experience in a rental car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"The survey data came from more than 1,300 car owners, all over the age of twenty-five, all of whom had rented a car within the past six months. And here are five interesting things it revealed.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>1. As a mind changer.</h3>\nEnterprise found that, for 88 percent of millennials—twenty-five-to-thirty-four-year-olds, for these purposes—<strong>a positive car rental experience could change their opinion of a particular make or model.</strong> Just 71 percent of older respondents had their perception of specific cars altered by a rental experience.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>2. As a technology showcase.</h3>\nThe study also found that <strong>young people were most likely to experience new automotive technology by using it in rental cars,</strong> since many don’t have access to brand-new cars of their own to drive. In the study, 68 percent of millennials reported they were more likely to experience new automotive technology as part of a rental car experience than any other way. This likely contributed to their potential to be impressed by rental cars, which are typically not the most thrilling cars on the road.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>3. As an image enhancer.</h3>\nWe’ve heard before that young people are especially concerned with image when purchasing a car and want a brand and model that they feel will reflect their own personal style and sensibilities. Enterprise says youngsters approach choosing a rental car the same way: 57 percent of twenty-five-to-thirty-four-year-olds believe that a rental car choice says a lot about a person’s style, personality, and values. Young people aren’t just walking onto the lot and choosing the first car they see; <strong>they’re seeking out just the right vehicle to complement their character.</strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>4. As a temporary change of pace.</h3>\nYoung people also view the car rental experience as an opportunity to try something new. More than half of the millennials surveyed indicated that they had a “desire to try something new” when driving a rental car. Older drivers want to play the field, too, if not in quite the numbers of their more youthful counterparts. <strong>More than one-third of all respondents said that they want to try something “completely new” when they drive a rental car.</strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>5. As a pre-purchase test drive.</h3>\nA good rental-car experience can do more than just change brand perception. It can actually propel people to the dealership. According to Enterprise, <strong>58 percent of those surveyed consider cars they have previously rented when shopping for a vehicle,</strong> and 28 percent of surveyed millennials were inspired to start shopping for a car after a positive rental experience.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"Drivers tired of boring rental cars can hope that this study inspires carmakers to flood rental fleets with fun new models aimed at buy-curious renters, but don’t expect too much: Escapism aside, nearly half of all the women surveyed said that fuel efficiency was one of the most important features in a rental car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<em>young driver: Nobilior/iStock/Thinkstock</em>","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":0,"fileName":"NewImage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/0/NewImage","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":9,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"","type":"image","vehicles":"","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":0},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":0}}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:26:22.849-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547182851 }} },{ "_id":485380,"title":"Bruce Weber's Detroit","subTitle":"Detroit-themed company Shinola is behind a brilliant set of images by the famous photographer.","slug":"bruce-webers-detroit","promoTitle":"Bruce Weber's Detroit","promoTeaserSmall":"Detroit-themed company Shinola is behind a brilliant set of images by the famous photographer.","promoTeaser":"Detroit-themed company Shinola is behind a brilliant set of images by the famous photographer.","keywords":["Bruce Weber's Detroit"],"metaTitle":"Bruce Weber's Detroit - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Bruce Weber","Shinola","Detroit","photos of Detroit","Detroit photography","Spirit of Detroit"],"metaDescription":"Bruce Weber's Detroit: Detroit-themed company Shinola is behind this brilliant set of images by the famous photographer.

So I dawdled as much as possible. I browsed the online inventory of cars slowly and at random. Then I searched by criteria: price, color, body style, miles, brand.

By the time Carvana had the votes tallied, I knew what car I wanted: a 2011 Infiniti M37 with nearly 30,000 miles on it for $24,500.

To have my car delivered to Wilmington, North Carolina, where I live, would cost $480. If I lived in Oakland, California, the cost jumped to $1,250. Or I could fly to Atlanta, pick my car up in an automated “vending machine” where I’d enter a code to unlock the garage and free my car, and road-trip my new wheels home.

Redesigned in 2012 and starting in the neighborhood of $24,000, the CR-V has been known for delivering safety and respectable gas mileage but without some of the trendier style attributes of its rivals. The CR-V offers 1,500 pounds of towing capacity and 37 cubic feet of cargo space even with the rear seats up, giving it plenty of room for errands around town or family road trips.  The engine has spirit, and the car’s steering and handling are assets, especially for its size. Honda didn’t do much to change the CR-V’s interior or exterior styling when it recently overhauled the vehicle, but that might be because the existing model worked fairly well.  One of the issues Honda should look to address in the future is the level of road noise.  It’s not quite enough to scare off buyers, but after living with the car for a while drivers will tire of the persistent outdoor sounds that bleed into the cabin.  And although the CR-V has intuitive controls, the navigation system could use an update.  Standard on every CR-V you’ll find one-pull fold-flat seats and a rearview camera, Pandora interface, and Bluetooth HandsFreeLink.  Owners of old CR-Vs will appreciate a lighter all-wheel-drive system that not only conserves fuel but also helps with tire slip. Don’t expect to customize your new CR-V too much.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Soapbox","id":1034787,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/soapbox","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-17T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driver-license-homepage","title":"argument on teen driving","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69772155/driver-license-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69772155,"fileName":"driver-license-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-17T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driver-license-homepage","title":"argument on teen driving","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69772155/driver-license-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69772155,"fileName":"driver-license-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-17T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driver-license-header","title":"argument on teen driving","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69772152/driver-license-header.jpg","fileMasterId":69772152,"fileName":"driver-license-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-17T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driver-license-homepage","title":"argument on teen driving","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69772155/driver-license-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69772155,"fileName":"driver-license-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":638249,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>Molly Says: No!

At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-21T10:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-homepage","title":"rosie the riveter","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68614264/rosie-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68614264,"fileName":"rosie-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-21T10:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-homepage","title":"rosie the riveter","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68614264/rosie-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68614264,"fileName":"rosie-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-21T10:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-header","title":"rosie the riveter","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70394427/rosie-header.jpg","fileMasterId":70394427,"fileName":"rosie-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-21T10:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-homepage","title":"rosie the riveter","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68614264/rosie-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68614264,"fileName":"rosie-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":640200,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Red-and-white polka dot bandana?

Watch out for pedestrians in areas where one would least expect them to be, like busy, dimly lit thoroughfares.</h3>\nTo start, it’s commonly believed that roadways are for car, truck, and bicycle traffic.  Some disagree, and hopefully, you won’t run into those folks (literally). Case in point is my twelfth caller, who sees a pedestrian dressed in dark clothing walking in the roadway on a busy street with fast-moving traffic.  A squad was sent to check on him.  They determined this pedestrian’s demonstrated aversion to using the city’s sidewalk infrastructure meant he might not survive if left to his own devices and transported him home. Likewise, call fifty-three was about a male staggering in traffic. The guy was intoxicated, as it turned out, and decided that he was going to hail a cab by floundering around in the middle of an intersection.  Regardless of how much a person has to drink, nobody wants to see anyone come to harm via the business end of an automobile, so the police helped him get a taxi.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>2. Be alert in gas station parking lots, which serve as venues for all kinds of odd behavior, including romantic.</h3>\nMaybe it’s not shocking that roadways are not a safe place to hang out.  Would it be surprising to learn that the common gas station can also serve as a setting for unexpected mayhem and mystery?  Such was the case for my fourth caller, who found himself on the losing end of a minor brawl near the gas pumps.  He didn’t know the woman who smacked him in the face, and I got the sense that he felt embarrassed.  Still, assault is assault even if it’s a woman throwing the punches.  This incident seemed to stem from a territorial dispute over who had first dibs on that particular gas pump.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Caller sixty-one was at a different filling station, and was watching a guy in the parking lot attack a car occupied by two women.  The suspect was trying to punch out the windows with his fists.  It’s not clear if he was angry at the car or its occupants, and the story never did come to light, because both the vehicle and the guy took off before the police arrived.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Call 101 came from a gas station employee who was growing increasingly concerned about three vehicles in the parking lot of the business.  One car was sitting at the pumps for almost an hour.  Two other cars were occupied and parked in front of the store for nearly as long.  Police checked it out.  The first one was sitting at the pumps for so long because its owner accidentally locked the keys inside and walked home to retrieve a spare set.  The other two vehicles belonged to a male and female who were meeting in person for the first time after becoming acquainted online.  They chose to meet at the gas station because it was a public place where both felt safe.  The suspicious vehicles turned out to be perfectly benign, but their occupants could just as easily have been up to something, so the clerk’s vigilance and willingness to call 911 are still good in my book.\n\t\n<h3>3. Keep your hands off people inside the car or anywhere else, either.</h3>\nOf course, there are worse places to be than a gas station parking lot, and not just for first dates.  Near the top of that list would be in the back seat of a squad car on its way to jail. Call sixty-four was about an incident that generated a flurry of calls from neighbors with a one-block radius.  Information was vague, but reports indicated that people were fighting and screaming outside an apartment building.  Several people saw a Jeep on the scene, in which the driver was attempting to strangle the passenger. The next caller wanted police to know that the Jeep was speeding away even as squad cars were closing in. Cops didn’t locate the Jeep, but if they had, that driver would probably have spent the night in jail, while his Jeep would likely have been towed to impound.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>4. Hypervigilance and caution may be called for when performing even seemingly routine tasks, like walking down the street, walking to your car, or loading groceries into the car.</h3>\nThings can get much worse when weapons are brought into the mix. I've taken calls in which cars are involved as a bone of contention, as a backdrop for a murder, and as a means of escape.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"First up is caller thirteen, who reports that a man has just brandished a handgun at a woman in her eighties outside a grocery store and carjacked the woman’s aging Honda sedan. Ironically, the vehicle this suspect has chosen to take at gunpoint sports a “War Is Not the Answer” bumper sticker. The Honda most certainly went right to a chop shop, and its frame and some of its less valuable pieces, like the plastic bits, will likely turn up abandoned behind a vacant property eventually. For whatever reason, I really hope that bumper sticker survives this ordeal somehow.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"When I return from my lunch break, I learn that there has been a fatal shooting just a few blocks from where I live. This type of thing makes me especially wary of my surroundings when I pull in my driveway after work, and I scanned the call screen for any descriptions of suspects or vehicles to keep an eye out for on the drive home. Information indicated that the victim was walking to his car from a party when he was approached by a male who may have been trying to rob him.  He died in the street outside his vehicle. When paths cross between two people, one of whom is willing to put their immediate wants and fulfillment of their whims over another person’s very life, the result is a senseless thing like this. These kinds of calls make me cringe, and when they’re in my own neighborhood, they’re even scarier and more depressing than usual, because there’s always that worry that the victim could be a neighbor or friend.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"Call 109 is the last call I answer on this shift, and it’s a shooting.  The phones light up as a wave of incoming calls about this same thing hits all at once.   My caller witnessed two men shoot a third guy, who fell down to the ground.  The shooters walked away, but then turned around, walked back, and shot the third man two more times before running away.  As police were headed to the scene, a fourth man came along and dragged the shooting victim into a van, which took off.  I don’t know if the victim in this shooting ever turned up at the hospital, but it is certain that the van he was loaded into was not an ambulance.   Regardless, I hope he survived.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<h3>5.  Leaving the car running unattended may seem like a good way to warm it up, but some people interpret this to mean “Hey, free car!”</h3>\nThe victims in these calls likely couldn’t have done much to prevent what happened to them without having some kind of sixth sense.  In certain cases, though, people unwittingly fling open wide the windows of opportunity for folks with bad intentions to climb right through.  This is the case in call thirty-eight, an auto theft report.  The owner of the vehicle had what must have seemed like a good idea at the time: he started his car and left it idling and unattended to warm it up.  Turns out that car thieves are more than happy to take a joyride in a toasty warm car. Which leads me to rule number six:","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"<h3>6. Learn how to properly use (or not use) the fancy emergency technology that’s built into your car so that the vehicle doesn’t end up crying wolf to the monitoring company and the police.</h3>\nThat story above was a case of user error, you might think, but what if your car is loaded with enough technology to take care of itself and a small colony of astronauts?  Take call forty-six, for example, from a company that handles mobile dispatching for Infiniti brand automobiles. They called to have officers check on one of their vehicles in which the panic/SOS button push signal was activated.  The monitoring company was unable to get a response from inside the car, nor could they get an answer on the phone that was linked to the account.  Police located the vehicle unoccupied, locked, and completely intact.  Perhaps the driver or an occupant mashed the panic button without even realizing it?  Or perhaps this car was lonely. You be the judge.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<h3>7. An argument over car keys can sometimes escalate until police intervention is called for.  It may be best to avoid loaning out the car altogether.</h3>\nIf you can’t trust strangers or technology with your car, surely you can trust your friends, right?   Well, if call ninety-eight is any indication; you can’t.   In this instance, two women were having a very spirited argument over one loaning her car keys to the other, who refused to return them.  There was talk of escalation and profanity galore from both parties as this battle of words raged on over the phone lines.  However, when the one with the keys realized that the police really were going to come out to chat with her, the two managed to bury the hatchet.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"<h3>8.  If enough people spot you driving a car like you stole it, eventually, somebody is going to share that information with the police.</h3>\nSome people’s driving techniques are better suited for competing in a demolition derby than for commuting. Caller number ten wants to tell me about a reckless driver in an old Cadillac sedan that was swerving over lane lines and nearly striking pedestrians.  Caller sixty-seven reported a black Chevy pickup truck that was speeding and blowing through stop signs and red lights.  This kind of driving is really dangerous and puts a lot of people at risk.  In both calls, I gathered vehicle information and direction of travel, ran the license plates, then sent a message to the squads on duty so they could track down the vehicles and their drivers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"<h3>9. Drive defensively, but if you do get in a wreck, try to get a plate number, just in case the other guy takes off.</h3>\nSometimes, careless drivers leave a trail of wreckage in their wakes.  In call twenty, it’s in the form of a multiple-vehicle accident.  This mess was initiated by a black sedan that struck my caller’s Saturn, knocking it out of its orbital trajectory and shoving it, coincidentally, into another Saturn, which then hit a Pontiac parked along the side of the road.  The black sedan fled the scene, making this a hit and run.  Call twenty-nine involved two SUVs.  One of them turned into the path of the other, causing the initial collision.  The one that caused the accident then fled the scene, striking a third vehicle while fleeing.  I can relate to how my callers felt, because my own car was struck by a hit-and-run driver a few years ago on my way home from work.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"Hit-and-run calls are extremely common; enough that one’s faith in humanity would be destroyed if it hinged solely on whether or not people stayed on the scene of an accident.  Who knows if that other driver has an invalid license, lacks insurance, has active warrants, may be intoxicated, or all of the above?  Well, you don’t.  But I bet the officer answering the call does.  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":17,"text":"<h3>10. If you’re feeling lost, try going to your left.  It works for some people.  Just don’t forget to stop when you get to where you are going.</h3>\nIt’s always good to have a sense of direction while navigating through whatever city you’re in, even if you’re on foot.  Take it from the new operator sitting across the aisle from me.  I overheard him talking to one of our frequent callers: a woman who tends to drink in excess, then wander about until she’s lost downtown or gets kicked out of a business for stumbling around and pestering patrons. My co-workers and I start to worry about her if several days pass without a call from her. This call was our new guy’s first time dealing with her, and he didn’t know where to send help because she didn‘t know where she was. In the years that I’ve been taking calls from her, the only instruction I’ve ever been able to get her to follow is to walk to her left until she finds a street sign that she can read.  I advised the new guy to try this technique, and he did get a cross street out of her so she could find a corner to wait for police.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":18,"text":"Even if each of the calls we receive at 911 involved something awful (which would not be the case, thanks to accidental dials, non-emergency calls, and people who let their babies and toddlers play with the phone), the odds are still in your favor to avoid disaster.  Look at the numbers.  The population of the city I work for is right around 400,000 people.  During my shift, we averaged six call takers on the phones.  Assuming each of them answered the same number of calls I did (109), that’s a 611:1 ratio of people to calls.  By my calculations, there’s only a 0.1635 percent likelihood of disaster or doom per person in a given eight-hour time span, and only a quarter of those (0.041 percent) are automotive related.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":19,"text":"I hope these examples help you gather the tools needed to avoid a phone chat with someone like me.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":6},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:26:43.788-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547203789 }} },{ "_id":490008,"title":"Seatbelts for Dogs: A How-To","subTitle":"Sleepypod's car harnesses aced safety testing.

As a young adult I kicked around motor-racing, training to drive while I worked at a Brands Hatch satellite in Miami.  I've been race staff at the Detroit Grand Prix, worked TV coverage of Formula 1, Indy and NASCAR and done the occasional ride and drive program.  Eventually my racing aspirations gave way to a long held interest in filmmaking and I got my B.A. from the University of Michigan's burgeoning film program.  U of M taught me to write and introduced me to my excellent husband.  We spent five adventurous years in Los Angeles in the entertainment and publishing industries before returning to Ann Arbor where our lovely daughter came into the world.  Personally, I expend a good deal of energy on K-12 public education advocacy.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Lunacy","id":1034778,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-lunacy","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-01T11:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"motor-city-masters-homepage","title":"ferrari ff to the spa","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65067164/motor-city-masters-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65067164,"fileName":"motor-city-masters-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":312},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":639}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-01T11:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"motor-city-masters-homepage","title":"ferrari ff to the spa","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65067164/motor-city-masters-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65067164,"fileName":"motor-city-masters-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":312},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":639}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-01T11:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"motor-city-masters-header","title":"ferrari ff to the spa","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65067167/motor-city-masters-header.jpg","fileMasterId":65067167,"fileName":"motor-city-masters-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":359},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":565}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-01T11:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"motor-city-masters-homepage","title":"ferrari ff to the spa","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65067164/motor-city-masters-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65067164,"fileName":"motor-city-masters-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":312},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":639}}},"pages":[{"id":641678,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"This website and <em>Automobile Magazine</em> generally take up enough of Jean's day, but this past month, she has added a new item to her portfolio: reality-show star.

His race report on the 12 Hours of Sebring was published when he was an eighteen-year-old Art Center student in 1954. Subsequently he has published thousands of articles on cars and airplanes, in American, Asian, English, European, and South American magazines. He contributed to several books, including the entire text of the well-reviewed <em>Auto Legends</em>, now available in five translated editions -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Polish in addition to the original English version. In 1985, <em>Automobile Magazine</em> founder David E. Davis, Jr., invited him to be one of two executive editors when <em>Automobile</em> was in the planning stages. Cumberford demurred, saying he knew nothing about magazine production and claims he still doesn’t, except that it’s important to meet deadlines. He contributed features from the beginning and began his popular “By Design” column in the sixth issue, September 1986.  \n<br><br>\nIn car design, Cumberford was even more a youthful prodigy. He sketched the body for the first car ever built to his designs when he was a fifteen-year-old Los Angeles high-school student. That car, the Parkinson Jaguar Special, is still active in historic racing sixty years after it was created. Hired directly by General Motors’ legendary Vice President of Design, Harley J. Earl, Cumberford became a professional car designer at nineteen. Leaving Detroit, he returned to California to attend UCLA to study philosophy. He rejoined the automotive world in the early 1960s and has continued to create new automotive shapes since then, always as an independent design consultant. He has lived and worked in six of the fifty United States and in France, Mexico, and Switzerland.

The gift shop and ticket office looked like they were straight out of the Sixties, but once underground I was impressed. The tour guide was funny and informative. The tour took us on a one-mile loop, and at the very bottom we were more than seventy feet underground, and it was close to eighty degrees. Definitely worth the time and the $19.95-per-person fee.

You seem to be following much more in JLR’s footsteps, as far as volume goes, and having driven it there’s no doubt Ghibli is credible, yet it too is a relatively low volume enterprise. Of course, for exclusivity, actually being exclusive has to beat saying you’re exclusive, while selling a million or more examples of similar cars.

If you look back to 2012, from the old QP [Quattroporte], Gran Turismo, and Gran Cabrio, we sold 6,200 cars globally. Now we have a new architecture, new engines, two new cars which we’ve launched. I can’t talk too much about the future – the SUV is on its way and will be ready Oct ’15, early ’16. As with any dogmatic statements, there are a lot of “buts” and “ifs” around it. If you talk about the extremely competitive mass-volume market, I think a million is a good number. We’re in a totally different business. The future of Maserati – and we sold 15,400 cars last year, 50 percent in the last quarter thanks to Quattroporte and Ghibli – we are going to make a significant step towards the 50,000 goal. Without making a precise number, I expect our global sales this year to be beyond 35,000. Obviously, the U.S. is an important portion.  For the time being I expect it to remain.
