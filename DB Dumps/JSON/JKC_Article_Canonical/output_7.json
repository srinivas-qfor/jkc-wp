Based on the Outback, the only changes that have been made in the Tribeca’s seven-year history are a new head-restraint design and a new addition to the paint palette. It’s unfortunate, because the Tribeca is a pretty well-appointed car. As with all Subarus, it comes standard with all-wheel drive and has a passenger volume similar to its more popular sibling. Like the Outback, it’s also good for hauling any sort of equipment that you find yourself transporting; the Tribeca has a cargo area under the rear floors in addition to flat folding second- and third-row seats. The up-to-date audio system and a rear-seat entertainment system will keep both you and your little passengers entertained. Heated front seats come standard for your driving comfort and an auxiliary air conditioning system to keep all your backseat passengers cool on hot, sunny days. The car’s only shortcomings are a tight third-row and a fuel economy that doesn’t compare to that of its competitors.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors: </strong><br />\n1.\tChevrolet Traverse<br />\n2.\tDodge Durango<br />\n3.\tHonda Pilot<br />\n4.\tMazda CX-9<br />","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items:</strong><br />\n1.\tRear vision camera. <br />\n2.\tReverse assist sensors.<br />","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks: </strong><br />\n1.\tEighteen-inch alloy wheels.<br />\n2.\tTinted glass on rear sides and liftgate.<br />\n3.\tAmbient illumination in footwells and on doors.<br />","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"SUVs","classGroup":"SUV","color":"","id":15499,"make":"Subaru","model":"Tribeca","year":2012},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":9},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:17:35.269-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546655270 }} },{ "_id":222684,"title":"2013 Mercedes-Benz GLK-CLass","subTitle":"The smallest Mercedes SUV calls time out for a thorough makeover and returns much improved.","slug":"2013-mercedes-benz-glk-class","promoTitle":"2013 Mercedes-Benz GLK-CLass","promoTeaserSmall":"2013 Mercedes-Benz GLK-CLass","promoTeaser":"2013 Mercedes-Benz GLK-CLass","keywords":["2013 Mercedes-Benz GLK-CLass"],"metaTitle":"2013 Mercedes-Benz GLK-CLass Buyer's Guide - Jean Knows Cars","metaKeywords":["2013","mercedes benz","glk glass","buyers guide"],"metaDescription":"2013 Mercedes-Benz GLK-CLass Buyer's Guide","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2012-09-28T17:32:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2012-09-28T17:32:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"buyer_guide","webExclusive":false,"url":"/new-cars/mercedes-benz/2013-mercedes-benz-glk-class/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[],"categories":[{"alias":"Mercedes-Benz","id":1025685,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/new-cars/mercedes-benz","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"new-cars","id":1024395,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/new-cars","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-10-28T10:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mercedes-glk250-2013-header","title":"Mercedes GLK250 2013 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/82564894/mercedes-GLK250-2013-header.jpg","fileMasterId":82564894,"fileName":"mercedes-GLK250-2013-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}}},"pages":[{"id":239411,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Standing tall and looking boxy, the GLK-Class is notably different from its chief competitors at Audi and BMW. While being somewhat roomier and offering better outward visibility, it hadn’t been as much fun to drive. Did Mercedes stand around and pout over it? No, they sought to improve the GLK for 2013. The exterior is refreshed with LED daytime running lights, a new grille, and bolder-looking bumpers. New LED taillights brighten the rear. Inside, the driver looks at a colorful instrument display and everyone can enjoy the optional, multi-color ambient lighting. The latest “mbrace” telematics system connects vehicle and smartphone. Of course the GLK offers a host of features for driver assistance and active safety. The biggest news, though, is that the GLK350 is fitted with a 3.5-liter V-6 that benefits from the addition of direct injection and makes 302 horsepower. It includes automatic stop/start, a fuel economy feature, which shuts off the engine when the car sits at a stoplight, then refires it when the driver releases the brake. Rear-wheel drive is available, or you get all-wheel drive with the GLK350 4Matic. The turbo-diesel-powered GLK250 Bluetec joins the lineup early in 2013.

The SL is a hardtop coupe and open-top roadster with a power top that folds away in twenty seconds, but when it’s up, the optional Magic Sky Control lets occupants control the darkness of the glass panel’s tint. For top-down comfort, vents in the seats deliver heat around your neck during the fall color tour. As beautiful as the SL is on the outside, it’s every bit as alluring and voluptuous inside. The seats are heated and actively ventilated (optional) for comfort. Nearly every driver assist and active safety feature you could think of except incoming missile avoidance is included. Under the long, creased hood is the SL550’s turbocharged 4.6-liter V-8 making 429 horsepower; this is outfitted with automatic stop/start for fuel economy purposes.

With a beautiful interior and no shortage of space in the back for adult passengers (even Shaq would be comfortable with the Extended Wheelbase version), the car can be customized endlessly, and most buyers choose to take advantage of Rolls-Royce’s bespoke design team. One option turns the Phantom into a theatre, with two rear monitors and a six-disc changer in the glove box. The four-passenger version has room in the backseat for a drink cabinet or cigar humidor. The Phantom is a little slower to 60 mph than the smaller Ghost, but still makes it in under six seconds while preserving Rolls-Royce’s characteristic smooth, quiet ride. Rolls likens the experience of being driven in a Phantom to a  “magic carpet ride.” The Phantom’s recent update brings a new eight-speed automatic transmission, LED lights, and slightly improved fuel consumption. Although, lets face it, if you’re driving around in this thing, you’re not worried about the price of gas.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 9","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

Featuring much of the same construction and technology as the Coupe, the Roadster distinguishes itself by losing the somewhat clunky hard top roof of its predecessor and serving up all the undeniable fun of a convertible. The John Cooper Works model is the most powerful, but no matter which engine model you choose the Roadster will deliver. The folding soft-top means the Roadster has even less cargo space than the Coupe and the interior can feel cramped, but the sporty-versus-space tradeoff is typical of convertibles, and the Roadster holds up well to its competition. The bold interior is almost identical to other Minis, with the large central speedometer and navigation system, toggle switches, and sport seats.  The 2013 Roadster will improve upon an already strong base by making the semi-automatic roof and rear windscreen standard, though of course this all comes at a price – specifically, a $1,200 bump from 2012. However, the Mini model of providing affordable performance automobiles rings true, and the Roadster still won’t break the bank.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Reviews","id":1023765,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos/car-reviews","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"All Videos","id":1023756,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T16:23:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40481366/jeans-driveway-2013-kia-sorento-sx-awd+promo-large.jpg","fileMasterId":40481366,"fileName":"jeans-driveway-2013-kia-sorento-sx-awd+promo-large.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1440},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2556}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T16:23:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40481363/jeans-driveway-2013-kia-sorento-sx-awd+header.jpg","fileMasterId":40481363,"fileName":"jeans-driveway-2013-kia-sorento-sx-awd+header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1440},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2559}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T16:23:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44261799/jeans-driveway-2013-kia-sorento-sx-awd+homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":44261799,"fileName":"jeans-driveway-2013-kia-sorento-sx-awd+homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":836},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2560}}},"pages":[{"id":239498,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The Kia Sorento SX AWD you see here is the absolute top-of-the-line Kia SUV.

A favorite is the turbo-diesel V-6 that makes 240 horsepower, but torque is what you feel first and at 455 lb-ft., it’s making fistfuls of it. The 4.6-liter V-8 is tuned for 362 horsepower in the GL450 4Matic and 429 horsepower in the GL550 4Matic. A seven-speed automatic transmission is common to all models. All-wheel drive is standard throughout the line. The GL gains slightly in length, width, and height. LED daytime running lights and tail lights accent the exterior, which has sleeker bumpers and a new grille. Inside, the driver looks at a colorful instrument display and everyone can enjoy the optional multi-color ambient lighting. Safety is seen to by the inclusion or availability of every sort of electronic abracadabra for lane keeping, curve-hugging, and close-to-curb parking. The standard power liftgate and power-folding third-row seats, with power-folding second row being optional, are desirable conveniences.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Among them should be a few “Heritage Edition” models rolling on chunky six-spoke, twenty-inch wheels, with rear fender liners, chrome trim bits, rear park assist, rear camera, adjustable pedals, and commemorative embroidery. Hybrid Sierras will continue through the 2013 model year using the current body style, still achieving 33 percent better city fuel economy than the standard Sierra and 23 percent better mileage overall. Heavy-duty Sierras, which also continue relatively unchanged through 2013, gain a new “bi-fuel” version of the 6.0-liter V-8 that allows them to run on compressed natural gas (if available), or gasoline. GM’s venerable 6.6-liter Duramax V-8 is on the options list, too, in case you have any houses that need to be towed somewhere. And as before, gussied-up Denali models of both light- and heavy-duty Sierras have been offered for people who want to live it up while hauling a load. All that said, while the Sierra is a fine truck, it’s not the freshest anymore.

For 2013, the Traverse gets a mild makeover inside and out. Part of the newness includes chrome accents and an updated center stack, as well as eight-way passenger seats and adjustable headrests. There’s also—first on the market—a front center air bag to protect people in the front seat in the event of a side collision. The third row of seats is split folding and is best left to the kids. In the second row, you can elect to have a bench seat to increase total seating capacity to eight. SUV-style options include a rear-view camera, Bose sound, a power liftgate, and a navigation system.

We at Jean Knows Cars don’t generally give a lot of thought to the finer points of torque, but consider the Silverado HD’s 765 pound-feet of torque, which is what gives this engine its massively competent trailer-toting strength. It’s also the reason that this truck gets a heavy-duty Allison automatic transmission—which can be shifted manually by the driver when the going gets dicey. In addition to that 397-horsepower V-8 diesel, there’s a choice of bi-fuel compatible or standard V-8 power, still nothing to sneeze at. There are even heavier-duty 2500HD and 3500HD versions, three-quarter-ton and one-ton, respectively. If you are interested in a truck that can run on compressed natural gas (CNG), get the extended-cab version of the 2500HD. Like its more normal-sized sibling, the regular Silverado, the HD comes in Ruby Red and Blue Topaz metallic exterior paint for 2013. But this truck is all about strength, not beauty: you can tow up to 23,100 pounds, depending on the model.

You can get it with a turbocharged 1.4-liter engine or a 1.8-liter engine with variable valve timing that makes 138 horsepower and yields 36 mpg on the highway. Beating that is the Cruze Eco model, which has lighter suspension parts and low-rolling-resistance tires, taking top honors for a non-hybrid at 42 mpg highway for the manual-transmission model. Chevrolet has also upped the technology ante on what was already a pretty great interior. Chevy’s MyLink information and entertainment system is standard on most versions, offering Bluetooth streaming audio and voice recognition. There are also two new audio systems on offer, including one with GPS navigation and a seven-inch color touchscreen. Perhaps the most appreciated 2013 addition is an optional Enhanced Safety package with park assist, blind-spot alert, and rear cross-traffic alert systems. To dress up your Cruze, there’s an RS appearance package with a rear spoiler, rocker moldings, an upgraded fascia, and chrome instrument panel accents instead of the standard silver.

This full-size SUV seats seven and comes in standard and extended-length forms and in rear- or all-wheel-drive versions. All are powered by a 5.4-liter V-8 that makes 310 horsepower, teamed with a smooth-shifting six-speed automatic transmission. Its towing capacity is a very capable 9,000 pounds, and it holds 128.2 cubic feet of stuff if you fold down the second row of seats. But practicality is only part of the story with the Navigator. Let’s start with the “responsibly harvested” walnut interior trim and go on upscale from there. A voice-activated touchscreen navigation system is standard, along with Sync AppLink that interacts with your smartphone, and the standard audio system is a THX II surround-sound system with fourteen (count 'em) speakers. The front seats are heated and cooled, the running boards are power deployed, and the pedals are adjustable. Safety equipment includes roll stability control with the added benefit of curve control, which maintains your hold on the Navigator when taking this big boy around curves quickly. Forward and reverse sensing systems both keep you apprised when you’re getting too close to objects. Here Lincoln gives a nod to “the full-size reality of the Navigator.”  No doubt about that! This is one large and in charge luxury vehicle for those who want to live the same way. Don’t expect favors at the gas pump, though: the Navigator tops out at 14 mpg city and 20 mpg highway for the rear-wheel-drive version, which is lowered to 13 mpg city and 18 mpg highway with all-wheel drive.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 5<br/>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong> Cadillac Escalade, Infiniti QX56, Lexus LX570<br/>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech:</strong> Curve control and roll stability control; power-deployable running boards; integrated blind spot mirror; Ford Sync with appLink to your smartphone; THX II surround-sound audio system with fourteen speakers <br/>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks:</strong> Walnut trim; optional monochrome appearance package; three new metallic paints: Kodiak Brown, Midnight Sapphire, and Ruby Red<br/>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"\r\n","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20593,"make":"Lincoln","model":"Navigator","year":2013},{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":7},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:17:42.438-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546662438 }} },{ "_id":222993,"title":"Dealer vs. Mechanic","subTitle":"Some pros and cons for you","slug":"dealer-vs-mechanic","promoTitle":"Dealer vs. Mechanic","promoTeaserSmall":"When your car breaks down, where should you take it?","promoTeaser":"When your car breaks down, where should you take it?","keywords":["Dealer vs. Mechanic"],"metaTitle":"Dealer vs. Mechanic - Jean Knows Cars","metaKeywords":["Dealer vs. Mechanic","dealer","dealership","mechanic","tips","car service","service center"],"metaDescription":"Dealer vs. Mechanic: How do you decide whether it's better to take your car to the dealership or a mechanic when it needs to be serviced?

My first articles focused on efforts by legislators to make once heavily polluting cars run cleaner. When I moved back to Michigan, that became my focus as I contributed extensively to the Detroit bureaus of both the New York <em>Times</em> and <em>Newsweek. </em>I became fascinated by how the automobile impacts so many aspects of our lives and reflects our styles and preferences. \n\nOver the past two dozen years as a freelancer, I've covered the auto industry for a wide variety of publications, including <em>Popular Mechanics, Scientific American,</em> iVillage, A<em>utomotive News, Ad Age, Hemispheres, Technology Review,</em> and <em>AARP. </em>I've also contributed pieces on air to public radio. My coverage has focused on such issues as the ways domestic automakers will respond to increasingly tough mandates for fuel-efficient cars while still designing vehicles that appeal to consumers, and my firsthand—and slightly scary—experience driving an autonomous car. But my stories are less about the vehicle than the person driving it.

So, just before Labor Day weekend, they bought a 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid instead.

The average ASA member consists of companies with under five employees.

He says over 370,000 technicians working in both dealerships and independent repair shops have this certification. While dealers represent only 30 percent of the repair business, a larger proportion of dealer technicians are certified.

While its overall rating of 42 miles per gallon is nowhere near that of Toyota’s iconic Prius, it represents a far more comfortable and sexy way to get your green on, with its nicely padded interior rendered in premium materials and the slew of available premium upgrades such as LED headlamps, radar-based cruise control, and an updated navigation system operated by Lexus’s innovative “Remote Touch” interface. Lexus calls the CT200h fun to drive, and for a hybrid, it kinda is, so long as your notion of “fun to drive” does not make acceleration a big priority. Even with the gas pedal pushed to the floor, getting up to highway speeds is a leisurely and noisy affair. The CT200h does have somewhat lively handling (again, for a hybrid), particularly with the tighter F-Sport package, which adds a snug suspension, sportier wheels, a mesh grille, metal pedals, and available black leather seats with white perforations. And the seats are decidedly sporty in the way they cup one’s bum.

Truckier than the slinky RX crossover, but not quite as grandiose as the ginormous LX570, the GX460 is nearly as comfortable on the interstate as a full-size luxury car while offering nearly as much off-road dexterity as a Land Rover LR4, not that many GX460s (or Land Rovers, for that matter) are destined to venture off-road—ever. The GX seats up to seven in leather-lined luxury, though you might want to think twice before you stick your boss in the tight third-row seat. On non-carpool days, the power third-row seat folds flat to open up some much-needed cubes of cargo space, and that space becomes even greater with the second-row seats folded nice and flat. The throaty, 4.6-liter V-8 has sufficient power, but the big news for 2013 is the installment of Lexus’ new, somewhat redundantly named Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System, designed to counteract body lean both on the road and off. That’s a good thing, considering how top-heavy the GX460 is. But style-wise, the GX remains one of the only Lexuses not to feature the company’s new form vocabulary; hence, it suddenly looks old. Still, the GX460 offers a luxo-ute experience which offers as much ruggedness as comfort, all assembled with the exquisite execution for which Lexus has become famous.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

On-road, it’s somewhat less at home, with horrendous blind spots, bump-a-long ride quality, and a slim, wide windshield that requires three wipers to clear. For an SUV, it also isn’t the most practical, thanks to its rear-hinged rear doors and modicum of cargo space. And don’t get us started on its fuel economy.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I'm lucky enough--or foolish enough--to be able to turn most of my avocations into something resembling a vocation. Except for motherhood, but that's its own reward, right?\n\nI was a record store geek back when there were record stores, and worked at the venerable (and late, lamented) Schoolkids' Records in Ann Arbor through college, while spinning jazz records at WEMU to the taxi drivers, barflies and night owls who listened during the wee hours. I then spent a dozen years as the corporate jazz buyer for the Borders Books & Music chain, a job that even in hindsight seems too good to be true.  After the music business--and Borders-imploded, I pursued another passion and joined the staff of AnnArbor.com as a food writer and community content coordinator. I spend a lot of time cooking, eating and writing, which also often feels too good to be true.\n \nAnd now cars. I’ve been a car geek since I could walk. I caught the bug from my dad, who saved up the paychecks he earned pumping gas as a teen in western New York until he could afford a gorgeous vintage 1939 Oldsmobile. My first car was my parents’ old Dodge Spirit--an innocuous-looking car that hid a turbocharged V6 under the hood. That car took me all over the country--and fast. If I shoved a Kleenex in the tape player to stop the rattling, I could easily cruise at 120 mph, a thought that now--as a mom--strikes fear in my heart.","fileMasterId":39817187,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39817187/39817187.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Babies","id":1034771,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/kids-in-the-car/babies","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Safety ","id":1023754,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/car-safety","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Kids in the Car","id":1034769,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-11T12:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Car Seat Years","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44195481/Standardbooks.jpg","fileMasterId":44195481,"fileName":"Standardbooks.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-11T12:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Car Seat Years","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44195478/HeaderBooks.jpg","fileMasterId":44195478,"fileName":"HeaderBooks.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-17T12:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40525784/the-car-seat-years+homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":40525784,"fileName":"the-car-seat-years+homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":240878,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"\r\nI remember the afternoon we got sent home from the hospital with our new baby.

His race report on the 12 Hours of Sebring was published when he was an eighteen-year-old Art Center student in 1954. Subsequently he has published thousands of articles on cars and airplanes, in American, Asian, English, European, and South American magazines. He contributed to several books, including the entire text of the well-reviewed <em>Auto Legends</em>, now available in five translated editions -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Polish in addition to the original English version. In 1985, <em>Automobile Magazine</em> founder David E. Davis, Jr., invited him to be one of two executive editors when <em>Automobile</em> was in the planning stages. Cumberford demurred, saying he knew nothing about magazine production and claims he still doesn’t, except that it’s important to meet deadlines. He contributed features from the beginning and began his popular “By Design” column in the sixth issue, September 1986.  \n<br><br>\nIn car design, Cumberford was even more a youthful prodigy. He sketched the body for the first car ever built to his designs when he was a fifteen-year-old Los Angeles high-school student. That car, the Parkinson Jaguar Special, is still active in historic racing sixty years after it was created. Hired directly by General Motors’ legendary Vice President of Design, Harley J. Earl, Cumberford became a professional car designer at nineteen. Leaving Detroit, he returned to California to attend UCLA to study philosophy. He rejoined the automotive world in the early 1960s and has continued to create new automotive shapes since then, always as an independent design consultant. He has lived and worked in six of the fifty United States and in France, Mexico, and Switzerland. The range of his design projects includes both racing and touring cars, trucks, aircraft, boats, hovercraft, and even ecological architecture. \n<br><br>\nHe is known worldwide for strong opinions but is well-respected in the design world because it is known that he is always completely honest in his views, with no agenda other than respect for good design and good designers. “There’s no ad hominem,” he says, “I judge the design, not the designers. There are designers I really like personally who’ve been credited with designs I heartily dislike -- for reasons I always state very clearly -- and designs I love done by people with whom I have absolutely no affinity. Except that we both like their work.”","fileMasterId":74354961,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74354961/74354961.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2022,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"rcumberford@gmail.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044,6202077]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-17T15:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Mercedes-Benz Furniture","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44299878/Pleyel-2-300-x-169.jpg","fileMasterId":44299878,"fileName":"Pleyel-2-300-x-169.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-17T15:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Mercedes-Benz Furniture","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44299776/Pleyel-Piano-Header-622-x-350.jpg","fileMasterId":44299776,"fileName":"Pleyel-Piano-Header-622-x-350.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":333},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-17T15:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Mercedes-Benz Furniture","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41153251/Pleyel-1-980-x-320.jpg","fileMasterId":41153251,"fileName":"Pleyel-1-980-x-320.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":623}}},"pages":[{"id":241244,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"There is undoubted romance to cars, never better expressed than by Ned Jordan’s classic advertisement for his Twenties Playboy roadster saying “Somewhere west of Laramie there’s a bronco-busting, steer-roping girl…” There’s romance to pianos, too, beautifully explained in Thad Carhart’s <em>The Piano Shop on the Left Bank,</em> subtitled “Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Despite that similarity, if you try to draw a link between automobiles and pianos — or vehicles and any musical instrument, for that matter — most people cannot see any possible connection.

Along with an exotic concept car, Peugeot showed a prototype piano conceived with the aid of the venerable piano maker Maison Pleyel, which, like Peugeot itself, was founded more than 200 years ago.

He was impressed enough by his “cross country” ride that he undertook a license to build Daimler’s engines, used first for boats and streetcars and then for trucks.

His purpose was to create instruments that enhanced the capabilities of musicians, including the virtuoso Chopin. Pleyel was a constant innovator and the first to make pianos with metal frames, as opposed to the all-wood structures used previously. That history of creation and change was one of the inspirations for the collaboration of the firm he founded with today’s Peugeot Design Lab, an ancillary part of the car company’s design operation dedicated to work for clients outside the automotive group.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>2005: BMW 507 Designer Tries Hand at Steinway Type A</h3>In recent years, there have been other exercises wherein car designers have tackled piano design. For the 125th anniversary of the Steinway’s Hamburg, Germany, operation in 2005, Albrecht, Count Goertz, a German-born American industrial designer best known for his masterpiece BMW 507 sports car, and for having imagined the Datsun 240Z, a great commercial success, was commissioned to create a baby grand piano. It was classical in appearance and very beautiful, with different textures and shades of black finish, but it broke no new technical ground. As the model A-188, it is available today at an unchanged price, $77,400.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>2007: Porsche Design's Bosendorfer Grand Piano</h3>Two years later, F.A. Porsche Design proposed another classically shaped grand piano for German piano maker Bosendorfer, this time with some functional changes from the concert grand piano pattern established in 1875 by Henry Englehard Steinway. The lid was made of a honeycomb-core material, lightweight but stiff enough to reflect sounds into the concert hall. The price is $120,000, about the same as a well-equipped Porsche 911 Carrera coupe, and it looks to weigh about the same as well.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>2009: Audi Design's Bauhaus-Inspired Bosendorfer</h3>Then, in 2009, Audi Design stylists did another Bosendorfer, this time taking the backboard almost all the way to the floor. The form was clearly inspired by Bauhaus concepts from the 1920s, with carefully delineated discrete shapes for each distinct component of the whole, including the keyboard and its cover, the pedal lyre in aluminum, and the pedals themselves. Apart from the fact that the lid is hinged below the upper perimeter of the piano, there are few changes from the classical form. This piano is commercially available for about $140,000 — again, comparable to the prices of top Audi car models.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":44299797,"fileName":"Pleyel 6 622 x 350.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44299797/Pleyel 6 622 x 350.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":44299827,"fileName":"Pleyel 3 622 x 350.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44299827/Pleyel 3 622 x 350.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":44299875,"fileName":"Pleyel 2 622 x 350.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44299875/Pleyel 2 622 x 350.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":44299785,"fileName":"Pleyel 7 622 x 350.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44299785/Pleyel 7 622 x 350.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":44299815,"fileName":"Pleyel 5 622 x 350.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44299815/Pleyel 5 622 x 350.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":41153245,"fileName":"Pleyel 622 x 350.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41153245/Pleyel 622 x 350.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":7,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":8,"text":"<h3>2012: Peugeot and Pleyel Advance the Art</h3>But, as shown in the <strong>photos above,</strong> none of the efforts in the time since William Steinway went into the car business have so completely altered the idea of what a grand piano should be as the Peugeot-Pleyel project. True to Ignaz Pleyel’s open mind in moving piano design forward, the new design incorporates advanced materials — carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics, principally — with a radical repositioning and reproportioning of the technical elements of the piano. The entire sound-producing set of strings has been lowered so that it is on a level with the keyboard. Thus, the pianist’s hands can be seen by the audience, and the artist himself or herself benefits from a better sound experience.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"Instead of three legs, the piano is supported by a single pedestal formed of an aerodynamically styled carbon fiber molding. To avoid any resonance of the hollow cantilever, it is filled with foam to make it acoustically inert. The soundboard and main body are made of wood according to traditional practice, giving a rich sound available with no other material. The lid is carbon fiber, but it does not require a prop to hold it open. Instead, gas struts and a clever mechanical linkage allow the lid to be opened and positioned by one hand.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"Like the other three contemporary car-designer pianos, the Pleyel by Peugeot Design Lab is available for purchase.

The words that describe me are DRIVE, determination, enterprise, initiative, eagerness, motivation, resolve, enthusiasm, hunger, commitment, sense of purpose. I have this crazy dream to become a great photographer and to have studios all over. I believe that we're put on this planet to enjoy life, that we have everything we would ever need to dream big, and that we can achieve the dream. I grasp the concept of first working for it, then deserving it.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Caroline Ashton, a sophomore at Guerin Catholic High School in Noblesville, Indiana, chose an online course over a traditional one because her extracurricular activities didn’t leave time for the intensive in-person programs offered in her area. “Most of my friends are doing it online, too,” she says. “You can do it on your own time.” ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Online courses allow busy students to complete segments when they have time between school, sports practice, student government, volunteering, and whatever else high-schoolers have to do to impress admissions officers these days. Ashton fills up her calendar with soccer-related commitments and balked at the traditional course offered in her area this summer, which would have taken up six hours a day every day for a week.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>Cost Savings for Today's Overbilled Parent</h4>\r\nAdding to their charm, online courses are often much, much cheaper than the classroom versions. Many online offerings cost less than $100, and some are as little as $10 to $20. In contrast, traditional driver ed courses can cost several hundred dollars or more. That math should be a no-brainer for most parents, especially considering the myriad of other costs associated with having a teen driver in the household.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Most of the courses include instruction in the form of video, text, and interactive elements, along with several quizzes and a final comprehensive test. Ashton’s course allows her to download study guides before tests so she can review material, much as she would be able to do in a classroom setting. Students still have to earn an acceptable score on the online tests to pass the class, and the courses are designed to take time to complete, so students can’t blow through all thirty hours of information in one weekend.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h4>You Don't Avoid the \"Student Driver\" Car That Easily</h4>\r\nTeens who opt for an online course still have to endure a certain amount of in-person instruction before they get the keys to the kingdom – or the family Honda, as the case may be. These requirements vary by state (and not all states allow online driver education for first-time license earners). In Ashton’s case, Indiana will require her to schedule six sessions with a driving instructor before she earns her learner’s permit, after which she will have to log fifty hours of driving (including ten hours of night driving) with a parent before she can take her driving test.\r\nTeens can’t just take any old course they find through Google, either. Courses must be approved by the state before they can be taken in place of traditional driver ed. Check with your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (or equivalent body) to find courses that are approved for first-time drivers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h4>States' Rules Differ</h4>\r\nDriver’s license requirements vary by state, and in some cases no formal instruction is needed for teenagers to obtain a license. Online courses, with their low cost-to-information ratio, could offer some peace of mind for parents that live in one of those states and are worried about sending their teens out on the roads without any expert instruction.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<h4>Kids' Temperaments Differ, Too</h4>\r\nAlso worth considering when contemplating an online course: your teen’s tendency to procrastinate. Ashton has been working on her course since August, and isn’t yet halfway through. She conceded that despite the convenience, she regrets not taking the course in person, saying (with just a hint of frustration), “I would have been done by now!”","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:18:09.787-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546689788 }} },{ "_id":333595,"title":"Dogs on Wheels: Book Review","subTitle":"","slug":"dogs-on-wheels-book","promoTitle":"Dogs on Wheels: Book Review","promoTeaserSmall":"Have dog, will travel?

But, as with so many things, resisting the temptation of a buzzing phone is easier said than done. So, for when you can’t trust yourself (or your teenagers) to abstain from texts behind the wheel, here is a sampling of smartphone apps developed by major cell phone service providers that will help keep eyes and thoughts on the road instead of on a mobile device.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h4>AT&T DriveMode</h4>\r\nThis app was developed by AT&T to discourage distracted driving. It stops call, text, e-mail, and app notifications while enabled. The app will accept phone calls from five pre-determined users while activated.

It can be downloaded for free from Google Play, Blackberry AppWorld, and the AT&T AppCenter, but only operates on the Android and Blackberry platforms.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h4>Sprint Drive First</h4> \r\nSprint customers who want to block texting while driving can turn to the company’s Drive First app, which detects when the car is in motion and then blocks call, text, and other notifications until the car has come to a stop.

DriveSmart will automatically route calls through a hands-free Bluetooth setup if one is in use, so drivers don’t have to be completely out of touch. The version of the app that automatically detects driving (DriveSmart Plus) costs $4.99 per month; DriveSmart Basic which does not automatically detect driving (requiring users to self-report), is free and comes pre-installed on T-Mobile’s Sidekick 4G, the LG Optimus T, and the Samsung Galaxy S 4G, Gravity Smart, and Exhibit 4G.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h4>Verizon Safely Go</h4>\r\nVerizon’s safe driving app will allow drivers to use up to three “driving apps” (navigation, music, etc) and receive texts and calls from up to three pre-designated contacts while driving, but will block notifications from all other texts and send an auto-response explaining that the user is driving.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-01-23T10:50:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Toyota Furia Concept","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46378710/Toyota-Furia-300.jpg","fileMasterId":46378710,"fileName":"Toyota-Furia-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-01-22T16:33:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46369254/toyota-furia.jpg","fileMasterId":46369254,"fileName":"toyota-furia.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-01-23T10:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"Detroit Auto Show","title":"Acura NSX Concept","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46378641/Acura-NSX-Concept","fileMasterId":46378641,"fileName":"Acura-NSX-Concept","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":446652,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h4>Editor in Chief Jean Jennings Picks:</h4>\nControversial: Toyota Furia Concept (top of page)<br>\nSexy: 2013 Maserati Quattroporte<br>\nGorgeous.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

This year, I came to Daytona to see Mazda’s fledgling effort in the brand-new GTX class, meant for manufacturers to showcase four-door sedans and new technology. Mazda’s racing boss John Doonan brought three Mazda 6 race cars to Daytona to shake out race-prepared Skyactiv diesel engines, the first diesel engine to race at Daytona.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-22T09:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Daytona","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48514605/Daytona-300.jpg","fileMasterId":48514605,"fileName":"Daytona-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-20T13:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Daytona","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43227301/Daytona-24.jpg","fileMasterId":43227301,"fileName":"Daytona-24.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":355},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-22T09:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Daytona","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43284748/Daytona-980.jpg","fileMasterId":43284748,"fileName":"Daytona-980.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":456238,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>The Rolex 24 at Daytona, January 2012\n</h3>\nLast year, 2012, marked the fiftieth anniversary of the most important twenty-four-hour race in the United States, the Rolex 24 at Daytona.

This year, I came to Daytona to see Mazda’s fledgling effort in the brand-new GTX class, meant for manufacturers to showcase four-door sedans and new technology. Mazda’s racing boss John Doonan brought three Mazda 6 race cars to Daytona to shake out race-prepared Skyactiv diesel engines, the first diesel engine to race at Daytona. Mazda expected the diesels to use fourteen gallons of diesel fuel in a fifty-minute stint, versus last year’s twenty-two gallons of gasoline in the same time frame.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Doonan’s strategy: \"Our first goal was to get three cars qualified.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

In Salt Lake City, I tested snow tires against all-season tires, and the results were pretty astounding.

If you live in a climate where you expect a lot of snow during the winter, having the right tires is important.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"5-ways-to-drive-better-in-snow","caption":"Nitto's NT90W snow tire, at rest (left) and in action (right).

Don’t Overdo It</h4>\nThis is good advice all year long, but I realized just how essential it is in snow while driving on the test course. As we were preparing for the collision avoidance maneuver, instructor Jason Smith warned us that when turning in the snow, the car’s response to steering input would be slower than normal. If you’re trying to make a turn in snowy weather and don’t feel the car respond, “don’t start turning the wheel more.” Instead, wait until the tires grip and the car starts responding, then see where you’re headed and correct from there. Otherwise, you could find yourself turning too sharply once the car gets traction.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"We were also advised to avoid giant, sweeping movements, which can be hard to correct on the snow’s slippery surface. (That’s not exactly shocking, but it’s important to keep it in mind, because you have to think and act differently when roads are covered with snow.) When you’re driving in the snow, don’t panic if your car takes a little longer to respond than it would in perfect conditions. Overcorrecting could leave you with an even bigger problem, so wait until you know where the car is headed before you change the way you’re turning the wheel.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"5-ways-to-drive-better-in-snow","caption":"An Infiniti G37x contends with the hill climb portion of the course.","fileMasterId":44035583,"fileName":"wintertires_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44035583/wintertires_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"order":6,"text":"<h4>3.

Then keep the power steady until you’re up and over. Easing off the gas will rob you of the momentum you need to counteract gravity as it tries to pull your car down the hill. Conversely, giving the car too much gas could leave your wheels spinning and you sliding backward.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"If you do find yourself making a return journey down a hill, don’t panic. Keep your foot on the brake, and try to guide your car down in a straight line. Then give yourself a little room to accelerate and try again, avoiding ruts and rough patches that other cars have carved in the snow.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<h4>4. Slow and Steady Wins</h4>\nEven when you’re not driving up a steep hill or a twisting mountain road, you shouldn’t be trying to win any races when the weather is bad. Controlling a car on a slick surface can get difficult pretty quickly. You’re more likely to slide going around corners, and since it takes time for a car to react to steering and braking input in bad weather, you may not be able to avoid a collision in time if you’re moving along at your normal cruising speed.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"Maybe you feel comfortable at 60 mph in a snowstorm, but if your car can’t come to a halt in time in case of emergency, you’re not driving safely.

Smooth Is Fast</h4>\nIt’s not a lot to grab on to, but perhaps the advice most often repeated during my snowy day at the track was simply to be smooth. Accelerate smoothly, steer smoothly, brake—okay, braking doesn’t necessarily need to be smooth. Sometimes you need that full ABS stop to avoid the hypothetical kid running out into the street.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"But accelerating gradually is key.

Avoiding broad, erratic steering movements can help you stay in control. Try to be direct and consistent when you turn the wheel.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

At the top of her game in this photo, the sultry, gender-bending German goddess Marlene Dietrich lounges with her ungodly 1934 Cadillac 452-D V-16 town cabriolet: a rare beast and a forbiddingly expensive one. But before she had a Cadillac, she had a green 1929 Rolls-Royce Phantom I, given to her on her arrival in Hollywood by Paramount in 1930. If you watch <em>Morocco,</em> her first American film, you'll be sure to see the car. Both the Cadillac and the Rolls-Royce are still in existence today. The Cadillac is housed in the Southward Car Museum in New Zealand, and the Rolls-Royce sold for $524,000 at auction in January 2012 to a private buyer.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"notorious-women-dietrich-henie","caption":"","fileMasterId":44406500,"fileName":"Sonja_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44406500/Sonja_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":3,"text":"<h4>Sonja Henie</h4>Sonja Henie was a child athlete in Norway, skating in the first Olympic Winter Games in 1924; winning gold in 1928, 1932, and 1936 for figure skating; and ranking as Norway's third-best tennis player before she came to America to star on the silver screen. <br>\n<br>\nIf you think the outrageous and exceedingly avant-garde 1936 Cord 810 shown here was an unusual choice for young Sonja, you'd be interested to know that she also had another Cord back in Norway, an L-29.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

She quickly turned to rallying, where she became without a doubt the most famous female rally driver until Michele Mouton took over from her in the late 1970s.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>Racing History</h4> Pat was a five-time European Ladies' Rally Championship winner. She and co-driver Anne Wisdom contested rallies all over Europe from the mid-1950s to the late '60s. Pat started in a Triumph TR2 that she bought herself and first distinguished herself with a 1958 win in the British RAC Rally in 1958, in a Morris Minor. She drove an Austin Healey 100-Six to fourth place in the Liege-Rome-Liege Rally, which she won outright in 1960. She was also winner of the 1962 Rallye Deutschland. After her marriage to Erik, she switched to the Saab factory team. They competed together in eleven international rallies in the mid-'60s.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Once, while she was dating Erik, she was ahead of him on the road in a rally, racing a Healey, and crashed her car and ended up upside down. The first thing Pat checked was if the side glass windows were broken, because they were very expensive. She was relieved to discover they weren't. So while she was upside down in the car, she was carefully removing the set screws that held the window in place. She was just about to remove the final screw when Eric came around the corner, saw her upside down, jumped out of his car in a panic, and ran to the car and kicked the window in. Much to his surprise, Pat came flying out of the car. What he had on his hands was a screaming, spitting hellcat, yelling, \"You bloody idiot! I'm perfectly fine, you've ruined my window.\"","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"After they got married, they lived in Monte Carlo for a long time as many drivers did to avoid taxes. When I met them, they lived on the Moss family farm in Tring, northwest of London. Erik mucked out the horse stables and would always admonish Pat to stop swearing and stop smoking because it would set off these horrible coughing fits. She tended a massive flower garden and did the cooking, both activities with an eternal cigarette hanging from her lips. Erik would say, \"That's right, pretty mom, light another cigarette.\" She would respond, \"Sod you, Erik.\"","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"I spent a lot of time with Pat in the 1980s and early 1990s.

If you take <em>Consumer Reports</em>’ advice, you should spend no more than 36 percent of your gross income on debt. This includes a mortgage (or your monthly rent, if you don’t own your home), credit card bills, and any other monthly payments. To determine what you can afford to pay for a car, add up all your monthly expenses and subtract that number from the 36 percent you can spend on debt. What’s left over is what you have to spare for a car payment.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>How Much Do You Plan to Spend?</h4> For example: the median household income in the United States is just under $53,000. Using our 36 percent benchmark, that household can spend about $19,000 per year on debt payments, or about $1,600 per month. Just for the sake of round numbers, if you have a $600 housing payment and another $400 in other debt, you’re left with $600 for new debt, like a car payment.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Bankrate.com, a personal finance site, has a different rule of thumb. They suggest that you spend no more than twenty percent of your monthly income on your car, which includes payments for insurance, car maintenance, and other operating costs.

","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h4>What About the Down Payment?</h4> Deciding on the size of your down payment is also important. Skiba says that these days, since many dealers no longer require a down payment as part of a new-car purchase, \"nobody’s putting any money down. You don’t have to.\" Putting little or no money down might make it easier to afford a car, since you won’t have to plop down a large lump sum before you get the keys, but it can also mean that you owe more than the car is worth almost immediately, since the value of a new car depreciates quickly once it leaves the dealer lot. It might be hard to come up with a sizable down payment, but it will lower your monthly payments and allow you to borrow less money to finance your purchase.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"Also consider operating costs (gas and maintenance) and how much it will cost to insure a vehicle. You’re going to spend more to insure a sports car than a minivan and more to fill up a large SUV than a compact car.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I found out about it when I longed to see my boyfriend, Ben, who'd hitchhiked from Ann Arbor with his friend PK to find J. Stevens, a mysterious Latvian friend of ours who went by the name on the shirt he'd bought secondhand at St. Vincent de Paul. J. Stevens had disappeared into the mountains somewhere above Aspen and was building an illegal shack on federal land. Ben and PK had the name of a guy who lived there who might know where J. Stevens was. So off they went, by way of Idaho and San Francisco, bar to bar to bar, in search of the elusive Latvian.<br>\n<Br>\nAfter one late-night, reversed charge phone call from the boys, I decided on a whim to go looking for all of them. I was eighteen years old. It took one ride to get from Ann Arbor to Colorado, where every campground was bulging at the seams with half naked, totally stoned, and barefoot flower children and their psychedelic school buses. Being from a tiny farm town of 5,000 people at the base of Michigan's thumb, I was overwhelmed by this rich tapestry of life. Actually, I was overwhelmed that I'd actually hitchhiked halfway across the country without being murdered and was in Aspen. Now what?<br>\n<br>\nGoing on the same single clue that the boys had, I found J. Stevens working away on a pile of ancient scrap lumber salvaged from an abandoned cabin in a small clearing, a mile straight up Little Annie on the backside of town. I set up my tent and sleeping bag and was immediately immersed in the routine of sorting scrap wood, hiking a half-mile across the mountain to fill and carry back water jugs from the stream, and hiking down the mountain to do laundry. I would hitchhike from the bottom of the hill to town, do the clothes, spend the night in a local campground with the Rainbow People, then hitch to the base of the mountain for the return hike up. On one such foray into town, I got out of a truck on the side of the highway at the exact moment Ben and PK were emerging from a truck that was dropping them off on the other side of the road! <br>\n<br>\n<strong>I'd been there a month already,</strong> so I hung out with them for another week and then decided to head for home. It took two rides. The first was from Aspen to Boulder in a Jeep with two guys in front, a German Shepherd in the back, and a box of eight-track tapes. I squeezed in with the dog. They dropped me at the top of an entrance ramp to Interstate 80 looking down over a rail yard.<br>\n<br>\nI was there for a couple of hours, in such a state of despair that I was seriously considering jumping a train. At one point, a police car raced past me to pick up a guy hitching farther down the ramp. Before I had to make a decision to run, two hippies in an old red-and-white station wagon backed all the way up the ramp and saved me. A guy and his sick girlfriend were on their way to Chicago.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At

Do the amount of advance research you feel comfortable with.</h4> Beth says she finds the average customer has already done eleven hours of Internet research before coming in to the dealership. “That’s the tool the Internet has given people. Do as much or as little research as you want before you come in,” she says, but understand that your salesperson is “actually there to help you. We have a fair amount of information that augments the research you’ve already done.” Having said that, she points out that she always invites her clients to confirm whatever information she gives them, if they want to. “I want my customer to feel comfortable at the end of the process.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h4>2. Get referrals from people you know and trust.</h4> “Ask your friends. Where did they buy their car, who did they buy it from, and would they go back there again? Even if you’re new in town, you know somebody you can ask: coworkers, neighbors, your dentist. If they wouldn’t go back to the same dealer, that’s a useful answer, too.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>3. Focus on getting the salesperson you want.</h4> “Eighty percent of new contacts are now e-mail initiated,” Beth explains. “A lot of times, unless you initially ask for a salesperson, you’ll get round-robined to whoever’s turn is next in the queue. Sometimes there’s a business development center in the dealership that handles e-mail queries and does initial contact until you make an appointment. At any time in there, if you have a preference—male, female, age, a used-car expert—you can specify. People are often thinking, ‘I want a blue car,’ not ‘I want a certain kind of salesperson to help me through the transaction,’ ” Beth says. Remember what stage of the transaction you're in and get that job done.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Next? “Once you get to the appointment, unless the salesperson warrants it, it’s not necessary to treat them like the enemy. You need to be willing to share with me, which means you have to trust me,” she says. But, she adds, if you find that your salesperson is not treating you well, or just isn’t going to make you feel comfortable, get up from the desk and ask for a different one. “Trust me,” Beth says, “we have thick hides.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"Not comfortable speaking up? If the relationship is not going to work, one way Beth has seen clients handle it is to end the appointment, then call the dealership from home to ask for a different salesperson. “That works!” she says.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h4>4. Understand your financial situation and be ready to consider various options.</h4> Beth remarks, “A shocking amount of what I do with people is financial planning.” Look at the salesperson as an informed resource who can help you find the best solution for your needs, she says. “Some people come in with a plan in place about how they’re going to buy the car—X money down, Y payment, Z equipment, pay off over A number of years—and sometimes I can help them see different ways of going about it that make it possible not to have to wait to have that down payment, or to pay a lower interest rate by getting a better car and saving money down the line.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<h4>5. Don't stress out and ruin the experience.</h4> “Don't be in your head 100 percent,” Beth says. In that, she is definitely on the same page with JeanKnowsCars.com. Like us, she sees that buying a new car is a treat, and you should let yourself appreciate the indulgence. “The numbers have to line up—size, fuel economy, specs—but don’t let that be the only factor. Let the salesperson help you enjoy the big purchase. Part of a purchase is emotional. If you don’t enjoy it, you’re not going to get the most out of it.” How to do that? Beth advises, “Relax, follow your instincts, and buy from someone you feel good about working with.”","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:18:30.390-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546710391 }} },{ "_id":345463,"title":"Who's Afraid of the Interstate?","subTitle":"Here's why you're wrong","slug":"whos-afraid-of-the-interstate-","promoTitle":"Who's Afraid of the Interstate?","promoTeaserSmall":"Are you one of those people who fears the highway and sticks to the back roads?","promoTeaser":"Are you one of those people who fears the highway and sticks to the back roads?","keywords":["Who's Afraid of the Interstate?"],"metaTitle":"Who's Afraid of the Interstate? - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Who's Afraid of the Interstate?

Federal transportation statistics say that, in 2007, there were just 0.54 fatalities per 100 million miles driven on urban interstates. Urban highways and arterial (main) roads saw 0.92 fatalities per 100 million miles driven, and local surface streets had 1.32 fatalities per 100 million miles driven. Rural roads, despite their low traffic and lower posted speed limits, are also measurably more dangerous than highways. <br>\n<br>\n\n<h4>Rural Roads Are 2.5 Times More Dangerous, Actually</h4>\nThat same year, data from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration reported that the fatality rate in rural areas was 2.5 times higher than the fatality rate in urban areas, regardless of road type.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-28T06:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 mercedes benz e350","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48621800/mercedes-eclass-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":48621800,"fileName":"mercedes-eclass-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-28T06:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 mercedes benz e350","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48621740/mercedes-eclass-01.jpg","fileMasterId":48621740,"fileName":"mercedes-eclass-01.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-28T06:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 mercedes benz e350","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48621743/Mercedes-Eclass-homepage-copy.jpg","fileMasterId":48621743,"fileName":"Mercedes-Eclass-homepage-copy.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":469293,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>The Car:</h3>\n<strong>Price:</strong> $66,290 (sedan) and $69,230 (wagon) as tested (including destination charge)</br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.5-liter direct injection V-6, 302 horsepower</br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Seven-speed automatic with shift paddles</br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 20 mpg city/29 mpg highway (sedan); 19/26 mpg (wagon)</br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Attention Assist—monitors the driver for fatigue</br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Lane Tracking package—includes blind spot assist and lane keeping assist ($875)</br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Audi A6, BMW 5-series, Infiniti M, Lexus GS</br>\nSee more specs on E-Class models in our <a href=http://www.jeanknowscars.com/mercedes-benz/e-class/ target=\"_blank\">Car Guide.</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>What I Think:</h3>\nI have owned a range of vehicles, but my favorite by far was a 2001 Mercedes-Benz E-Class wagon.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Soapbox","id":1034787,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life/soapbox","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-07-03T07:15:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 fiat 500L","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54407799/fiat500L-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":54407799,"fileName":"fiat500L-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-07-03T07:15:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 fiat 500L","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/49011950/fiat500L-header.jpg","fileMasterId":49011950,"fileName":"fiat500L-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-07-03T07:15:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 fiat 500L","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/49011845/fiat500L-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":49011845,"fileName":"fiat500L-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":469933,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>Looking Back and Moving Forward</h3>I was dashing out of the building, on my way to grab an espresso before heading to the airport.

Produced in 1936 under the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini, the Topolino was meant to be a car for the masses and a form of affordable transportation for Il Duce’s modern industrial nation. It was, in fact, the precursor to Germany’s Volkswagen, which means “people’s car.” A term of endearment—the name Topolino means “little mouse” and is what Italians call Mickey Mouse—the name was meant to evoke association with the advanced modern society of America and the American way of living.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"In an interesting turn, the American way of living is also the basis for the articulation of the 500L.

How does the interior space relate to and reflect lifestyle? These are distinctly Italian questions. There, the car is not just a means of transportation but also is often considered an additional room and exterior space to the house. Indeed, the inspiration for the spatial organization of the 500L was not a past vehicle, but the modernist iconic interpretation of the Italian palazzo/villa design, Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye. Built in 1928 in France, the Villa Savoye sought to reduce the villa design to its fundamental elements and translate that expression with the most modern of materials. The emphasis focuses on the piano nobile and articulates that space of living with steel and glass, the modern materials allowing a panoramic view that takes in the countryside around it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"When Fabrizio put up the slide of the Villa Savoye, the overall design of the 500L suddenly made sense. While the slightly quirky and bulbous exterior of the 500L pays homage to the exterior lines of the Topolino, the interior draws directly from the history of modernist architecture. The frame alludes to the steel structure, and the rest is filled with windows. Their glass wraps the car, providing an exceptional panoramic view that mimics the living spaces of the Villa Savoye.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"<strong>How does the thought given to design translate into the driving experience? I drove a black 500L through the streets and highways of Baltimore.</strong> The exterior takes getting used to, but, like the Cinquecento itself, its quirky lines quickly became charming in comparison with the prosaic lines of so many other vehicles on the road. The spatial effect of the interior conceptualization struck me immediately. The panoramic view opens the space and is, in fact, quite liberating. One does not feel constrained in a “small car space,” and I found my viewpoint from the driver's seat equal to the spatial experience and open field of vision one gets sitting high up in an SUV. That delighted me, as a small woman who can rarely see the hood of the car she is driving.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2014 fiat 500L","caption":"","fileMasterId":54407892,"fileName":"fiat500L_05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54407892/fiat500L_05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":17,"text":"I was worried that the size of the gearshift, designed to maintain proportion with the voluminous interior, would be far too big for my hand, but instead it was remarkably comfortable, and I could shift with ease.

Although it is not safe to put your feet on the dash, my dashboard is scuffed from teenage transgressions. The dash in the 500L is covered with a fabric that echoes the fabric of the seats. The fabric may be tough, but could it withstand snagging and scuffing from heels? Like the modernist aesthetic that drove the design, the interior has a crisp, clean feel. But it’s fair to say that the modernist aesthetic often ignores the realities of teenage living, and this is no different. It’s an impractical spot for fabric. Fabric in general is impractical with children, and were I to get the 500L, leather seats would be a must.

However, it is priced aggressively to bring in the young urban buyers looking for the ease and convenience of a small car but wanting a vehicle that sets them—and their lifestyle—apart from the usual car-buying public. <br>\n<br>\n\nFrom a practical standpoint—drive, interior layout, audio systems, seating, and manipulation of space—this car works well. From a sense of style and history, it certainly distinguishes the driver from the rest of the pack.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-09T13:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"fiat lust part three test drives","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46786790/fiat3-promoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":46786790,"fileName":"fiat3-promoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-09T13:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"fiat lust part three test drives","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46786721/fiat3-header.jpg","fileMasterId":46786721,"fileName":"fiat3-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2212},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":3931}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-09T13:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"fiat lust part three test drives","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46786715/fiat-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":46786715,"fileName":"fiat-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":463955,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"fiat lust part three test drives","caption":"","fileMasterId":46786763,"fileName":"fiat_06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46786763/fiat_06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":0,"text":"<em>My story began in the winter (<a href=http://www.jeanknowscars.com/features/style/fiat-lust/ target=\"_blank\">Part One</a>), when I first started considering whether I could justify replacing my Honda Odyssey with a Fiat 500.

I was in that efficient maternal mode, prone to frustration, as I was trying to squeeze in three test drives while the children were at play rehearsal. Moreover, I was a touch resentful that I was spending the first sunny Saturday in weeks car shopping. Mother Nature seemed to be telling me: “You know you want the Fiat.

","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<h4>When Am I Supposed to Go Look at Cars?</h4>\r\nA not-so-fun fact about the state of Michigan: a law that dates from 1953 prohibits the sale of automobiles on Sunday in areas with populations of 130,000 or more. Those populations can buy liquor starting at 7:00 a.m. on Sundays, but not cars.

","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"Michigan is not the only state with such a law. That said, in the twelve other states that ban vehicle sales on Sundays, the approach to sale hours is far more sensible. Some dealerships outside Michigan stay open until 9:00 p.m. on Saturday; some are only open until 6:00. In Ann Arbor and other Michigan cities, most dealerships close at 3:00 or 4:00 on Saturdays. There are other dealerships that even close at 5:00. As for hours on the weekdays, Monday and Thursday are often the only nights with hours that last until 9:00 p.m.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"While I applaud the resistance to Sunday hours reluctantly, I might suggest that the pattern of dealership hours harks back to a different, idealistic era of the workforce and American life, when the men were at the office, the wives were at home cooking, dinner was on the table by 5:30, and the family could visit the dealership on the way to Dairy Queen. How quaint and 1950s-esque. Perhaps dealerships might take notice of the new reality. I’m lucky if I’m home by 6:30. Dinner on the table before 8:00 is a rarity, which does not exactly leave time on Mondays and Thursdays to pop out for a test drive. And Saturdays? Throw in one hockey game or another typical Saturday children’s event, and it doesn’t exactly leave a large window between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. I’m not quite sure when parents are supposed to car shop in this town.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<h4>Perhaps My Gender Has Something to Do with This?</h4>\r\nHowever, I wondered if gender were coming into play at the <strong>Toyota/Scion</strong> dealership. As I embarked on my test drives, I was curious about how the process would go as a woman shopping alone. All the other times I’ve looked at cars in my life, I’ve been with my now ex-husband, who was quite happy to take the lead in the “man’s world” of car shopping.

I am fully confident that had I been a man in a suit, as opposed to a small woman in black jeans and a fleece jacket, the experience would have been different. I felt the same at the <strong>Ford</strong> dealership earlier that afternoon. I wandered around for ten minutes without anyone speaking to me. I noticed, however, that when a couple or an older gentleman walked in, they were greeted immediately. I finally went to what seemed to be the front desk and asked, only slightly sardonically, if I had to sign in, as one does at the doctor’s office. There was a sudden scramble to find a sales associate. Could it be that, from a distance, I look about twenty years younger than I am? If that is the case, should it matter? ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"The time spent at the Toyota/Scion and Ford dealerships gave me the opportunity to analyze the spatial arrangement of the two dealerships in which I was virtually ignored. Neither dealership’s layout is conducive to customer interaction. The low ceilings and crammed central spaces ringed by messy offices result in a claustrophobic atmosphere that makes leisurely browsing unwelcome. In the case of the Ford dealership, it was easy to get lost among the cars, signs, and people jammed into the central area. Given my size, it is quite possible that it was easy to miss me.   ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"As an architectural historian, I should note that spatial arrangement has a profound effect on customer perception and quality of service. At the <strong>Mazda</strong> and <strong>Honda/Volkswagen/Audi</strong> dealerships, the vehicles occupy the showroom floor, and the offices are set to the back of the building. One has space, literally and figuratively, to examine the models on display, and the salesmen have the space to observe and approach an unattended customer. The <strong>Chevrolet</strong> and <strong>Fiat</strong> dealerships—both owned by the Suburban Group—took consideration of space one step further. Spatial fluidity drives the showroom arrangement. The vehicle display blends with open and inviting desk spaces. “Inviting” seems to be the mode, as both dealerships had salespeople who greeted each customer who walked in the door. And that is how I met the striking, if not quirky, saleswoman at Suburban Fiat.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Fiat Lust","caption":"","fileMasterId":48771195,"fileName":"Fiat_header2.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48771195/Fiat_header2.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2339},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":4156}},"order":17,"text":"<h4>An Italian Aesthetic, Minus the San Pellegrino</h4> No dealership exploits spatial expressions of brand image better than Suburban Fiat, where Italian architectural design meets Italian auto manufacturing. To be fair to the other dealerships in town, this space was purpose built and brand-new, having been open for only a short time. Moreover, the entire space is given over to one car and one car alone: the Fiat 500. Yet the spatial branding is so well done. Drawing from glass-box mid-twentieth-century modern design, the building has a façade of plate glass windows with ceilings twenty-five feet high. One enters a showroom in which a row of five or six Fiat 500s are neatly aligned. Sleek display cases house Fiat brand merchandise (everything from key chains to coffee mugs to polo shirts) on the back wall to the left, while the right-hand back wall contains an interactive display where one can select and watch videos of the 500 in action. The cabinets in the office area continue the modern aesthetic: mod and Fiat red with minimal hardware. The theme of sleek Italian design even carries to the restrooms, sparsely articulated with slick fixtures. Imagine an Italian auto dealership fit for <em>Dwell</em> magazine, and you have Suburban Fiat.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":18,"text":"Space alone, however, does not create an Italian ethos. Activation and associations of a space depend on the personalities and the rituals within. In every way, Suburban Fiat embodies the Italian ethos. Just to the right of the door to the dealership is a low, modern built-in desk with chairs of taut black leather and chrome. A woman greeted me as I walked in. It dawned on me later that she was the only female salesperson I encountered at six dealerships. Tall and model thin, she sported  short, cropped hair and an elegant, flowing outfit accentuated with arresting jewelry. “Hi. Welcome to Fiat. Are you interested in the 500? Have a seat. Would you like an espresso or a water?” This is my kind of car shopping.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":19,"text":"The Kirkland brand water that she handed me, straight from Costco, as opposed to the bottle of San Pellegrino I was expecting, was the one slightly jarring reminder that I wasn’t in Italy.

Just as I was finishing, a couple returned from a test drive.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

The CVT has Eco and Sport driving modes. Getting to make those choices might make drivers feel they are in a more expensive car. Toyota’s Star Safety System is standard, with such modern safety items as stability control, brake assist, and electronic brake-force distribution.  A little less modern is the retention of a four-speed automatic transmission. For those who want a manual transmission, that one's a six-speed, though.
