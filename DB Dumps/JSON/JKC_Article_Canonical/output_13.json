I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

RLX stepped up its tech game for 2016, and luckily many of the bells and whistles now come standard. Acura has the slightly frustrating practice of distinguishing between models based on packages, so for the RLX there are the Navigation, Technology, and Advance packages. For 2016, the company has dropped two packages, and Navigation is now the base model. Now that we have that cleared up, let’s talk standard features. Navigation, rain-sensing wipers, power seats, and forward collision warning are included on all package levels, which is rather incredible. The options also include some cool features, such as front and rear parking sensors and a heated steering wheel. The RLX’s 3.5-liter V-6 produces 310 horsepower, and if you opt for the Sport Hybrid, a three-motor system with lithium-ion battery will deliver 377 horsepower. Despite all the power under the hood, this vehicle received five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and was named a Top Safety Pick Plus, the highest accolade from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. There is no manual transmission available, but a seven-speed dual-clutch is found on the Sport Hybrid model. The RLX delivers luxury and performance without a BMW or Mercedes logo on the grille. You can decide whether that’s a good or bad thing.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>New for 2016:</strong> AcuraWatch expands scope and content of safety and driver assistive technologies<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura RLX Sport Hybrid.","fileMasterId":142426664,"fileName":"acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142426664/acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura RLX Sport Hybrid.","fileMasterId":142426661,"fileName":"acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142426661/acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura RLX Sport Hybrid.","fileMasterId":142426688,"fileName":"acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142426688/acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura RLX Sport Hybrid.","fileMasterId":142426685,"fileName":"acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142426685/acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More to Read:</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround/2016-acura-nsx-designer-walkaround/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Designer Walkaround: 2016 Acura NSX at the Detroit Auto Show</a> (with video)","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45301,"make":"Acura","model":"RLX","year":2016},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":46612,"make":"Acura","model":"RLX Hybrid","year":2016},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:29:48.990-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547388990 }} },{ "_id":697048,"title":"2016 Lexus RX","subTitle":"Some updates, but the most noticeable addition?

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034953,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/car-on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-10T10:51:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-toyota-prius-promolarge2","title":"2016 Toyota Prius Promolarge2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142984226/2016-Toyota-Prius-promolarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":142984226,"fileName":"2016-Toyota-Prius-promolarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-10T10:51:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-toyota-prius-promolarge2","title":"2016 Toyota Prius Promolarge2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142984226/2016-Toyota-Prius-promolarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":142984226,"fileName":"2016-Toyota-Prius-promolarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-10T10:51:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-toyota-prius-header2","title":"2016 Toyota Prius Header2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142984223/2016-Toyota-Prius-header2.jpg","fileMasterId":142984223,"fileName":"2016-Toyota-Prius-header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":964397,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, front-wheel-drive hybrid hatchback<br>\n<strong>Estimated price:</strong> Starting around $25,000<br>\n<strong>On-sale date:</strong> Early 2016<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> Prius, Prius Eco<br>\n<strong>Estimated fuel economy:</strong> 56 mpg city/53 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>Safety features:</strong> Toyota Safety Sense package (pre-collision alert with pedestrian detection, lane departure alert with steering assist, full-speed dynamic radar cruise control, automatic high beams)<br>\n<strong>Competition</strong> (all prices include destination charges):<br>\n2016 Chevrolet Volt ($33,995)<br>\n2016 Ford C-Max Hybrid ($25,045)<br>\n2016 Honda Civic Hybrid ($25,555)","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> We will see...","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>LAS VEGAS—If you want something to be seen as important, you have to make it look important.</strong> In these crazy, crazy days of cheap gas and sport-utility vehicle lust, hybrid sales have been in freefall.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-28T08:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-kia-sorento-sx-l-homepage","title":"2016 Kia Sorento Sx L Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/148351886/2016-kia-sorento-sx-l-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":148351886,"fileName":"2016-kia-sorento-sx-l-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-28T08:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-kia-sorento-sx-l-homepage","title":"2016 Kia Sorento Sx L Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/148351886/2016-kia-sorento-sx-l-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":148351886,"fileName":"2016-kia-sorento-sx-l-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-28T08:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-kia-sorento-sx-l-header","title":"2016 Kia Sorento Sx L Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/148351664/2016-kia-sorento-sx-l-header.jpg","fileMasterId":148351664,"fileName":"2016-kia-sorento-sx-l-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":966533,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2016 Kia Sorento SX Limited AWD</h3>\n<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, all-wheel-drive mid-size crossover<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> L,  LX, EX, SX, SX Limited, Limited V6  <br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $42,595 (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $45,095 <br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, 240 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed automatic with Sportmatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 20 mpg city/27 mpg highway <br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Search-Results?searchtype=model&make=KIA&model=SORENTO&year=2016\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">5/5 stars</a>; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: <a href=\"http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/kia/sorento-4-door-suv\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Top Safety Pick 2015</a><br>\n<strong>Competitors</strong> (prices include destination charges):<br>\n2016 Chevrolet Equinox LTZ AWD  ($32,385)<br>\n2016 Honda Pilot Touring AWD ($43,700)<br>\n2016 Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring AWD ($30,350)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cc1AsxDkPX4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2016 Kia Sorento Sx L 27","caption":"","fileMasterId":148351865,"fileName":"2016-kia-sorento-sx-l-27.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/148351865/2016-kia-sorento-sx-l-27.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>There’s nothing that says New!

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-29T12:20:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-infiniti-qx50-homepage","title":"2016 Infiniti Qx50 Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/148718618/2016-infiniti-qx50-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":148718618,"fileName":"2016-infiniti-qx50-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-29T12:20:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-infiniti-qx50-homepage","title":"2016 Infiniti Qx50 Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/148718618/2016-infiniti-qx50-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":148718618,"fileName":"2016-infiniti-qx50-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-29T12:20:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"infiniti-qx50-header","title":"Infiniti Qx50 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/148718651/infiniti-qx50-header.jpg","fileMasterId":148718651,"fileName":"infiniti-qx50-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":966796,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2016 Infiniti QX50 RWD</h3>\n<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, rear- or all-wheel-drive luxury crossover<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> QX50, QX50 AWD<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $35,445 (rear-wheel drive); $36,845 (all-wheel drive) (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $43,095<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.7-liter V-6, 325 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Seven-speed automatic with manual shift mode<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 17 mpg city/24 mpg highway <br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: Not yet rated; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: Not yet rated<br>\nCompetitors (prices include destination charges):<br>\n2016 Audi Q5 2.0 TFSI ($41,825)<br>\n2016 Acura RDX ($36,190)<br>\n2016 Lexus NX200 ($36,360)<br>\n2016 Porsche Macan S ($53,595)<br>\n <br>\n<h3>Fun-O-Meter: 8.5</h3>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Infiniti Qx50 23","caption":"","fileMasterId":148718888,"fileName":"infiniti-qx50-23.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/148718888/infiniti-qx50-23.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>My husband, a.k.a.

Trax is a member of a relatively new variety of vehicle, the subcompact crossover, which has a 100.3-inch wheelbase—only an inch or two longer than a Honda Fit or a Ford Fiesta—and the tall body of a sport-utility vehicle. Its mere existence is a tribute to the fact that people are increasingly swapping out their sedans for practical, high-riding vehicles with available all-wheel drive. There's no denying that the Trax, all new in 2015, is an attractive choice in this category. It's nominally a five-passenger vehicle, but you wouldn't really want to be the person in the middle of the back seat. With that back seat folded, there are 48.4 cubic feet of cargo space. For comparison purposes, the Honda CR-V, a more traditionally sized compact crossover, offers 70.9 cubic feet with its rear seat down.

The 2016 Chevrolet Volt looks a whole lot more like a \"normal\" five-passenger car and less like some kind of futuristic fantasy of the 1990s, and that is a very good thing. It wasn't a big seller in its original incarnation (fewer than 80,000 sold in the five years on the market), even though it has the advantage over plug-in hybrids of being seamless, switching from all-electric to gasoline power with no human intervention.

That's up 40 miles from the previous model.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"The 2016 Chevrolet Volt has a 20 percent larger battery pack (which lives under the floor near the center of the car) and a more powerful, yet lighter gasoline engine.

It also has more space in the back seat—you can even seat five now, but only in a pinch.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034953,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/car-on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-19T12:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"odyssey-promo","title":"Odyssey Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98625805/odyssey-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":98625805,"fileName":"odyssey-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-19T12:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"odyssey-promo","title":"Odyssey Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98625805/odyssey-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":98625805,"fileName":"odyssey-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-19T12:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"odyssey-header","title":"Odyssey Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98626192/odyssey-header.jpg","fileMasterId":98626192,"fileName":"odyssey-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":982434,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Welcome to Five Cool Things from <a href=\"http://www.JeanKnowsCars.com\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">JeanKnowsCars.com</a>!</strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeeaRrplkE8?autoplay=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Try to tell an Odyssey family that minivans aren't cool.

General Motors: Your First Self-Driving Car May Be a Ride Share</strong> <br>\nLyft, a ride-sharing service that often takes a back seat to the more famous Uber, made its own headlines this week as GM announced a long-term partnership. GM will be spending $500 million toward building a network of self-driving cars you can order up with your smartphone. GM chairman Mary Barra announced that the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt, an all-new electric car, will have the smartphone technology on board to make it a centerpiece of this ride-sharing plan. Intriguing! For its part, Lyft will build a network of autonomous cars, while GM will set up national rental hubs where Lyft drivers can pick up non-autonomous vehicles to drive for pay. That’s right, the vision is that eventually you’ll be able to do everything from commuting to earning cash as a driver yourself, all without owning your own car.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Volvo Concept 01","caption":"","fileMasterId":167970728,"fileName":"volvo-concept-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/167970728/volvo-concept-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":9,"text":"<strong>5.

That color.</strong> Omaha Orange is a historically significant color for Chrysler. The Renegade is based on parent company Fiat's 500X and made in Italy, but its all-American credentials are underlined by its Omega Orange color, a classic for Chrysler that dates back to early 1960s muscle cars. On the 2016 Jeep Renegade Latitude we tested, that orange tint is carried into the interior (see Cool Thing #2). One not-cool thing to add: We love the orange, but those light-cream-colored fabric seats (Sandstorm, they're called) are going to look terrible in a matter of months, no matter how careful you are, and who wants to be careful in a Jeep? Luckily, you can get them in black.

Active safety equipment: good backup for the adventurous driver.</strong> The Advanced Technology group ($995) gives you lane departure warning, full-speed forward collision warning, and rear park assist. The lane departure warning system does more than blink a warning at you; it gives you a little nudge to the electronic power steering to help keep you in line if you get too far afield in your lane. The Renegade also gets blind spot monitoring, rear cross-path detection, and a rearview camera with dynamic gridlines. If you're a slow convert to these modern aids, don't be; they do very little to impede your fun and a lot to improve your safety on the road.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<strong>5. The roof comes off.</strong> Chrysler's My Sky power retractable/removable panels cost $1,470, but they are elegant and double the fun of driving this Jeep on a sunny day.

You use a cool-looking skeleton key to unlock the panels from the outside, then take them right off and store them in the rear cargo area.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

It’s about moving beyond the carpool mindset and going for something more appealing to drive. Its looks are on the curvy side, distancing it from the boxy minivan aesthetic, yet it still has the kind of interior space a cargo- and kid-carrying family will appreciate. The Edge can be fitted with a turbocharged four-cylinder or one of two V6 choices. With the four, fuel economy is 21 mpg in the city and an impressive 30 mpg on the highway, while the V6s offer 19 mpg in town and 26 or 27 mpg on the highway.

Long a traditional rear-wheel-drive SUV, the Explorer was completely remade for 2011 into a front-wheel-drive/all-wheel-drive crossover. It even comes with the option of a four-cylinder engine. That hasn’t changed its reputation as a go-anywhere utility vehicle, though. Teamed with all-wheel drive on V-6-powered models is Ford’s optional Terrain Management. This system lets you dial in the vehicle’s response to the surfaces on which you’re traveling, using pictograms for grass/gravel/snow, sand, mud/ruts, or normal. There’s also Hill Descent Control, which takes over the braking duties when you go downhill, so you can concentrate on steering. Other helpful features include adaptive cruise control, a blind-spot warning system, and parking assist. The Explorer Sport model gives you both more power and more style, with 350 horsepower from a twin-turbo V-6 engine, a set of twenty-inch wheels, and contrast stitching on the seats. As for fuel economy, you can get 28 mpg on the highway, but only if you forgo all-wheel drive and get the four-cylinder engine. With the V-6 and AWD, you’ll get 23 mpg on the highway, and the Explorer Sport tops out at 22 mpg highway. It’s not the most exciting product on the market, either to drive or to look at—but for those who want to haul stuff, carry up to seven people, and feel more like a rugged adventurer than a boring commuter, the Explorer is a popular choice.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong><br />\n6.5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br/>\n1.

Based on Toyota’s “compact” Tacoma pickup, the 4Runner is still an excellent off-roader. However, with the whimsically styled and even more off-road-inclined FJ Cruiser also in the 2013 lineup, Toyota has taken the 4Runner’s trim levels considerably upmarket. Particularly in the fancy Limited grade, with standard leather seating, push-button start, navigation, and a slew of options including a fifteen-speaker sound system, the 4Runner is downright posh. Powering the 4Runner is a grunty, if a tad raucous, 270-horsepower 4.0-liter V-6 paired with a five-speed automatic—not the most sophisticated powerplant in the Toyota lineup but entirely capable. (If you’re looking for a smooth operator, check out the Highlander crossover.) Fuel economy is so-so, but to its credit, an eco-driving feedback system allows the driver to see just how much gas the vehicle is swilling at any given time. Off-roading remains a specialty for the 4Runner; particularly in Trail grade, no mid-size SUVs other than the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the aforementioned FJ Cruiser can keep up with the 4Runner once the pavement ends. Our favorite 4Runner feature, however (standard on all trim levels, thankfully), is the stereo, with its outward-facing speakers in the back for tailgate parties.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Gone is the EX35 model and in its place is the EX37. Infiniti says the rear-wheel-drive model returns 17 mpg in city driving and 25 mpg on the highway. The EX37 is getting a little long in the tooth and is due for a major revision. Despite that, the midsize luxury crossover that seats five still manages to convey a sense of high style. The crossover, which also can be ordered in all-wheel-drive configuration, earns kudos for its acceleration and handling. Front-seat passengers are coddled, but back-seat passengers may feel like second-class citizens. It’s just plain cramped back there, plus there is limited cargo room in the rear. Standard features are plentiful and include leather-trimmed seats, a smart key with push-button start, and eight-spoke eighteen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. But it’s a mystery why upscale Infiniti charges extra for an optional driver’s seat headrest coat hanger and the better audio systems. There’s lots of useful technology as well, but be prepared to pay extra for it. Those options include a blind spot warning system, lane departure prevention system, intelligent cruise control, and intelligent brake assist with forward collision warning. The 2013 EX starts at $37,300, including an $950 destination charge, making it $2,645 cheaper than a base 2013 BMW X3. But keep in mind that the optional premium package on the EX37 adds another $3,050 to the bottom line, while the tech package costs $2,750.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Infiniti G37 Coupe base model is no longer available. There are now only three models in the G sedan lineup: the G37 Sedan Journey, G37 Sedan Sport 6MT, and G37x Sedan AWD.  Prices range from $37,795, including an $895 destination charge, for the base Sedan Journey to $42,395 for the Sedan Sport 6MT. All Gs now get a standard 328-horsepower 3.7-liter V-6 engine mated to either a seven-speed automatic transmission or a six-speed manual transmission. The G convertible is our least favorite of the body styles because the retractable hard top can squeak and creak on all but the smoothest roads. The G gets high marks for good handling, user-friendly controls, and attractive cabin materials. The G37 still ranks as one of the most fun-to-drive cars in its class, but the cramped rear seat in the coupe and convertible models is best left to small kids.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

On the plus side, some models – the Mazda 3 comes in sedan or hatchback form– get up to 40 mpg on the highway. If you want to save at the pump, check out the 155-horsepower Skyactiv-G 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. But you’re going to find a bit of a trade-off since the Mazda 3 is relatively expensive. While the base 2013 Mazda 3 starts at just under $16,000, including a $795 destination charge, the top-of-the-line model is priced at $23,695, including shipping. The Mazda 3 is meant for people who don’t think of their car as an appliance and want a sportier look and feel. The compact Mazda doesn’t disappoint in this area, offering five- or six-speed manual transmissions, in addition to a five- or six-speed automatic transmission. The handling is more performance-oriented than you usually find in this class.

It has tons of power, a comfortable ride, bold exterior styling and an upscale interior. But despite being touted as a sport sedan by the Japanese automaker, its front-wheel-drive layout and continuously variable transmission make it fall short of its lofty goal. Dare we call it a family-friendly sedan without insulting Nissan designers? The five-passenger sedan serves as Nissan’s flagship, but it suffers from a smallish cabin. It is again offered in two models, 3.5 S and 3.5 SV, each powered by a standard 290-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 engine. It returns decent fuel economy at 19 mpg in city driving and 26 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. One downside: the Maxima requires premium gasoline and that can raise your fuel budget compared to other models that get roughly the same ratings. The ride in the Maxima is well damped and comfortable with fairly limited body roll. The sloping roofline in the rear limits headroom for backseat passengers and the high beltline may make smaller passengers feel slightly claustrophobic. The biggest problem with the Maxima, though, may come from the Nissan stable. The less-expensive Nissan Altima sedan received a major makeover for the 2013 model year, which may steer some buyers away from Maxima once they step into a Nissan showroom.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Murano CrossCabriolet is plagued by convertible issues like a body that shakes when it goes over bumps since it doesn’t have a solid roof to boost rigidity. It also offers minimal cargo space and has poor rear and side visibility. The unusual convertible gets a power cloth top roof, all-wheel drive and comes in just one model. It is equipped with a 265-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 engine linked to a continuously variable transmission. In a rare twist on a convertible, the CrossCabriolet can tow up to 3,500 pounds. It can be dressed up with optional quilted leather-trimmed seating and comes with twenty-inch five-spoke titanium finish aluminum-alloy wheels. Standard safety features are plentiful and include dual pop-up roll bars for rear passengers. Nissan dropped the price of the CrossCabriolet for the 2012 model year and has not yet announced pricing on the 2013 model. Be prepared to pay more than you would for a conventional Nissan Murano.

This turbocharged four is very energetic and produces the same 240 horsepower as the old engine, but it burns fuel more frugally. That ought to put a smile on the face of anyone who takes satisfaction in doing more with less. Meanwhile, the X3 35i uses a 3.0-liter six-cylinder, and the output is 300 horsepower. An eight-speed automatic is the only transmission in the X3 range. Driving Dynamics Control allows you to select either of two sport modes, which regulate variability in steering effort, transmission shift points, and the vigilance of the stability control system, but the result is a jumpy, nervous vehicle that shifts gears frenetically. The normal mode is fine. A good thing about DDC, though, is the Eco Pro mode that monitors all onboard mechanical systems and electrical functions for efficiency. It even relays tactful suggestions about your lead-footed style of driving, if this is warranted. Quicker down the road, plusher inside, and better-riding than ever, the X3 has already made big steps forward.

The carryover Forte is available as a sedan, hatchback, and coupe, which Kia calls the Koup. The Forte LX and EX models are equipped with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 156 horsepower. The uplevel Forte SX gets a 173-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. The EPA says the smaller engine with a six-speed automatic transmission returns 26 mpg in city driving and 36 mpg on the highway. The EX model with the 2.0-liter engine can be outfitted with an optional Eco Package that includes a “smart” alternator and low-rolling-resistance silica tires that give the fuel economy a little boost. Competition is heating up in the small-car segment, with the Hyundai Elantra and Ford Focus stealing some of the limelight away from the Forte. Kia is still a good value in the segment, despite the fact that the Forte gets a modest price increase of around $225 for the new model year. Expect to pay $16,175, including a $775 destination charge for the 2013 Forte sedan, $18,175 for the Forte Koup, and $19,075 for the Forte hatchback. But that’s still under the $20,000 mark, a critically important psychological barrier for many buyers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

For those of you in frostier climes, you may want to consider either the Limited or 200S models: both feature remote start and heated front seats, which are perfect for keeping warm on those long morning commutes when thermal underwear just isn’t enough. There are two engine choices: the 2.4-liter four-cylinder or Chrysler’s new 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6, which only comes with the Limited sedan. You also have the choice of a four- or six-speed transmission, but the latter is only available as a standard feature on the Touring and Limited editions.

It’s about moving beyond the carpool mindset and going for something more appealing to drive. Its looks are on the curvy side, distancing it from the boxy minivan aesthetic, yet it still has the kind of interior space a cargo- and kid-carrying family will appreciate. The Edge can be fitted with a turbocharged four-cylinder or one of two V-6 choices. With the four, fuel economy is 21 mpg in the city and an impressive 30 mpg on the highway, while the V-6s offer 19 mpg in town and 26 or 27 mpg on the highway. All-wheel drive is an option for all models; it cuts fuel economy by about 2 mpg. The Edge offers well-tuned and responsive steering, along with some of the latest in safety technology: roll stability control, side air curtains for the first and second rows of seats, and blind-spot mirrors. A Blind Spot Information System is optional. Ford’s Sync multimedia system and MyFord Touch touchscreen interface are both available on every Edge except for the base model, but prepare for a learning curve. The top-end Edge, the Sport, has the biggest V-6 (305 horsepower) and lots of upscale goodies, including paddle shifters for the six-speed automatic transmission, charcoal leather-trimmed seats with metallic silver inserts, a Sony audio system with HD radio, six-way heated power seats, twenty-inch polished aluminum wheels with black spokes, and chrome oval dual exhaust pipes.

The interior has also been redesigned with new instrument clusters. That could help the multipurpose vehicle—more attractive than a minivan, more carlike than an SUV—get some of the sales momentum it has been lacking. Despite its stance as an anti-minivan, the Flex is very family friendly. A new feature for 2013 is a set of inflatable rear seatbelts—belts with airbags inside, an industry first—that can deploy in 40 milliseconds, a boon to those carrying children or older people as passengers. There’s also a choice of second-row buckets or a bench that gives the Flex room for seven. In the excitement department, the Flex’s new V-6 engine makes 287 horsepower and highway mileage of 25 mpg. An optional EcoBoost V-6 turbo makes an invigorating 355 horsepower and gets 23 mpg on the highway. One of the best things about the Flex is how upscale you can make it: the Titanium appearance package has charcoal leather-trimmed seats with perforated gray leather inserts, a wrapped steering wheel with black bezels and a striking set of twenty-inch wheels. But watch out for the rising price as you add on the attractive extras.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The 420 horsepower GTS, with its 4.8-liter V-8, had been the line-up’s newbie, producing 20 horsepower more than the S, but the Diesel came along this fall. It has a 3.0-liter V-6, and although the 240 horsepower doesn’t seem that impressive, there’s plenty of whomp with 406 lb-ft. of torque. Rather than part-time all-wheel drive, the Diesel’s system is permanent. And of course, the S Hybrid achieves the highest efficiency numbers.

The 2013 model will be the Accord’s first redesign since 2008, and will feature a coupe model in addition to the familiar sedan. The Accord coupe concept caused a huge stir when it debuted at the 2012 North American International Auto Show, and for good reason. New features include Pandora Internet radio connectivity and available lane departure and forward collision warning. The new Accord will also offer SMS functionality for phones with Bluetooth capability. The Accord’s interior isn’t quite luxurious, but it is functional. That is not to say it is completely devoid of innovation, though. A new feature in the top trim level delivers a push-button start option to this practical commuter car. The redesign should offer some excitement to the brand, and a new reason to buy perhaps the most practical car on the market. The 2013 Accord will earn up to 36 mpg on the highway, not quite on par with competitors.

The 2013 earns 22 to 23 mpg in the city and 30 to 31 mpg on the highway, a slight uptick that nonetheless pushes it above the 30 mpg benchmark. Honda’s biggest crossover offers 1,500 pounds of towing and 37 cubic feet of cargo space even with the rear seats up, giving it plenty of room for errands around town or family road trips. The engine has spirit, and the car’s steering and handling are assets, especially for its size. Honda didn’t do much to change the CR-V’s interior or exterior styling, but that might be because the existing model worked fairly well. The CR-V has intuitive controls, though it’s navigation system could use an update. Right in the middle of Honda’s price range, the CR-V has a base price topping out just above $30,000. This also makes it one of the cheaper utilitarian vehicles on the market, easily beating the price of larger SUVs while still providing impressive capacity.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

Strange, of course, does not always mean bad. The Ridgeline’s design is its most unusual feature, giving it the air of an SUV with a chunk missing. It bucks traditional pickup build by being the only mid-size truck on the market with a cab and truck bed built in one piece, meaning that the sections don’t bounce around separately while driving. This gives the Ridgeline a smoother ride than many pickups, while still maintaining the convenience of an open-bed truck. It is, however, significantly more expensive than many of its competitors, with a base price range in the $30,000s. The Ridgeline has a 250-horsepower V-6 engine and is rated to tow 5,000 pounds. With four doors and two rows of seats, the Ridgeline can seat five, though the cabin is not appointed quite as well as the rest of Honda’s fleet. As if the Ridgeline needed any more cargo space, there is a lockable in-bed trunk with 8.5 cubic feet of storage for anything you don’t want flying around the truck bed. As always with Honda, the Ridgeline is reliable and drives well.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

It has had its growing pains in the last few seasons due to fussy controls, a batty information and entertainment system, and quality concerns, but it seems to be back on track as it spruces up its act for 2013 with the addition of all-wheel drive and two new powertrains. The new, 240-horsepower turbocharged engine gets 29 mpg on the highway, which isn’t too bad for a mid-size sedan. For those with a need for speed, there is the option of the new supercharged V-6, which replaces a five-liter V-8. What is neat about the V-6 is that not only does it come with Jaguar’s own all-wheel drive system, but it is also pretty fuel-efficient. If you want to throw caution to the wind completely, give the performance XFR a whirl, which puts the \"R\" in \"racy.\" If you still aren’t sold, just remember that the beauty of a Jaguar sedan is that you can pretty much take it anywhere, somewhat like a perfect little black dress that can be dressed up or dressed down.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Immediately recognizable as a Lamborghini, the aggressive front end transitions seamlessly into an aerodynamic roof and back end. The car’s most striking features are its two jack-knife doors, which immediately announce the Aventador as an exotic car – though not without giving it a Batmobile-like air. Much of the body, including the passenger cabin, is constructed out of weight-shaving carbon fiber.  This helps the V-12 engine make the trip from 0 to 60 mph in less than three seconds.  The interior is modern to the first degree, with a digital dashboard and large, center-mounted navigation system. The cabin comes in either monotone or two-tone leather.

This five-seater is propelled by a Ferrari-engineered V-8 engine that allows it to reach speeds of almost 170 miles per hour. The Quattroporte handles curvy roads like a much smaller car, but the cabin still feels roomy and luxurious. The leather seats can come in one of ten colors, and with a similarly wide selection of exterior colors and Maserati’s extensive personalization options, the Quattroporte can be exactly the sedan you’ve always dreamed of. It goes without saying that this doesn’t all come for free. The Quattroporte lives in the $130,000 range, and with its unimpressive gas mileage (12 mpg in the city, 19 on the highway) the Quattroporte would be expensive as an everyday car. However, the fuel economy tradeoff is one you’ll make with any performance automobile, and while it would be easy to double your fuel economy by driving a Honda, the accompanying decline in driving enjoyment would be far more painful than a costly trip to the pump.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 9","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

Mercedes-Benz’s 4Matic all-wheel drive system is available. The CLS63 AMG comes with a 5.5-liter turbocharged V-8 producing 518 horsepower.

Who would take their $113,000 truck out on the Rubicon Trail? Rather, the G-Class has a cool, authentic look that comes from form following function, and makes the driver feel like the hero in an apocalyptic action-adventure film. For 2013, Mercedes-Benz has refreshed the G with new interior appointments. Foremost among them is a freestanding, seven-inch, tablet-style central display unit. There are also steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters for manual control of the seven-speed automatic transmission. A suite of technological systems is added for parking and blind spot assistance, with adaptive cruise control thrown in for good measure. Outside on the G’s square nose, LED daytime running lights are now in place. The 5.5-liter V-8 in the G550 now produces 388 horsepower.

The Mini is already spritely, but this version looks even more quick and maneuverable. Better yet, it actually is quick and maneuverable, and certainly won’t bore you. The John Cooper Works model is the most powerful, but also the most expensive, though with strong fuel economy, you could make up the difference in time.  Like the rest of the Mini family, this two-seater features sport seats and a very large, center-mounted speedometer. The passenger cabin has a trapdoor to the trunk in case you’re transporting something too long for the tight cargo space, and a center armrest can come equipped with a built-in iPhone charging cable. The best thing about the Coupe may be its price. With even the most expensive model barely topping $30,000, the Coupe easily beats the price of luxury competitors but still has spunk.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition: </strong><br />\n1.

It has not been the butt of hostility the way the Hummer, for example, has been. And even though there has been a Suburban on the market for nearly eight decades, no committee has turned it into a Suburbanette or taken it off the job it is on earth to do: haul people and stuff capably. If you’re shopping for one, know that you can choose from three V-8 engines, and in half-ton or three-quarter-ton versions. Active Fuel Management is on hand to bust that eight down to four cylinders when cruising, to save on gasoline, and E85 can be used. But you don’t care about that as much as two other numbers: how much cargo, and how many people? The answers are: 138 cubic feet, and nine people. There are also comfort features on board, including a second- and third-row DVD system, touchscreen navigation, a backup camera, and heated seats in the front two rows. So what are you waiting for?

It can be configured in an amazing number of variations, including five trim levels, a choice of three bed lengths up to eight feet, three cab sizes up to crew cab, rear- or four-wheel drive, and five V-6 or V-8 engines—plus there’s even a hybrid. Fuel economy may not be what a full-size pickup is about, but the Silverado 1500 Hybrid can tow 6,100 pounds while getting 23 mpg on the highway—the eco equivalent of bringing home the bacon and frying it up in a pan, we guess. There’s also a conventionally V-8-powered Silverado, the XFE, that offers 22 highway mpg thanks to “aerodynamic enhancements.” New for 2013 is powertrain grade braking for models with the six-speed automatic transmission, which downshifts the transmission to cool down the brakes on those long downhill stretches. Also, there are two new metallic exterior colors, Deep Ruby and Blue Topaz. But decorative touches are a minor point. GM leaves no doubt about what kind of buyer it’s aiming this truck at, using terms like “broad shouldered” and “chiseled”—to describe the truck, not the customer, but chances are, the descriptors fit both.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tFord F-150<br />\n2.\tGMC Sierra<br />\n3.\tRam 1500<br />\n4.\tNissan Titan","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421904,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421904/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items:</strong><br />\n1.\tOptional rear backup camera.<br />\n2.\tPowertrain grade braking downshifts transmission on downhill driving to save the brakes.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421907,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421907/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks: </strong><br />\n1.\tChrome bumper standard on three trim levels.<br />\n2.\tGrab-style door handles good for glove wearers.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421964,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421964/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>New for 2013:</strong><br />\n1.\tRuby Red and Blue Topaz metallic paint colors added.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20497,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Silverado","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"Trucks","classGroup":"Truck","color":"","id":17683,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Silverado","year":2013},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"8bfe9141-264d-3530-adde-b612c376b580","type":"mediaTag","name":"Trucks","path":"/Main/Trucks"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":6},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:30:23.739-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547423740 }} },{ "_id":222825,"title":"2013 Chevrolet Corvette","subTitle":"Six decades of wind in the hair and a song in the heart.","slug":"2013-chevrolet-corvette","promoTitle":"2013 Chevrolet Corvette","promoTeaserSmall":"Six decades of wind in the hair and a song in the heart.","promoTeaser":"Six decades of wind in the hair and a song in the heart.","keywords":["2013 Chevrolet Corvette"],"metaTitle":"2013 Chevrolet Corvette Buyer's Guide -

Making no concessions to this late-middle-age number, in 2013 Chevrolet is selling the fastest convertible in the history of the bow-tie brand, the 427 convertible. With its carbon fiber body parts and 505-horsepower 7.0-liter V-8, it’s pretty much a droptop version of the Corvette Z06. GM is calling it a Collector Edition, so keep that in mind. The Z06 coupe comes in a limited Carbon edition that has many of the styling features of its more powerful ZR1 sibling. Speaking of the ZR1, the top Corvette’s supercharged V-8 makes 638 horsepower and lets the Vette go north of 200 mph. The big story for 2013, in addition to the last year the current-generation C6 Corvette is in production, is the Sixtieth Anniversary appearance package. It’s a pretty classy-looking Arctic White exterior with two shades of blue on the leather-wrapped interior. An optional graphics package shouts a bit more loudly about the anniversary, and naturally there is badging inside and out to make this package more special. Corvette buyers looking for something a little less pricey may prefer the lower-frills Grand Sport, still with a sub-four-second 0-to-60-mph time close to that of its pricier stablemates. Add to that the base coupe and convertible models, and you’ll see that there’s a Corvette at price points just above $50,000 to a bit over $100,000.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 9","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC

2013 MKT has the same sharp good looks as the rest of Ford’s luxury brand’s lineup. The MKT is the large crossover member of the family, and as such it has the capability to seat up to seven people in comfort. For 2013, Lincoln has added Drive Control and continuously controlled damping, which manage the tradeoff between the ability to handle this big vehicle and the comfort of the people inside. It actually adjusts the suspension twenty times per second to get that job done. The EcoBoost 3.5-liter V-6 engine has been upgraded for 365 horsepower (it was 355 hp last year). Curve control to keep you in charge of this big vehicle when going around curves, plus lane keeping technology, are welcome additions for 2013. The interior has also been refreshed, both cosmetically and with the addition of inflatable rear seatbelts. On the outside, the grille gets the new, somewhat aggressive-looking treatment similar to that of other Lincolns this year, and wheels are available in nineteen- and twenty-inch sizes. Ford’s Sync system is available in an expanded version with WiFi hotspot capability. As you might expect from such a large, luxurious crossover, Lincoln is offering it to the professional-driver market in Livery and Limousine models. But you can get your own and make it your family’s limousine.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong>: <br/>\n1.

Enter the redesigned 2013 ES, with suddenly sexy sheetmetal and a larger, scrumptious interior; together, they elevate this model from entry level status to truly desirable in its own right. Highlights of the ES’s exterior include Lexus’s new spindle grille, flanked by predatory headlamps underscored by a row of LED running lamps. The slab-like sides are complimented by side windows outlined in chrome, while ES wraparound LED taillamps dress up the rear. Inside, passengers face a new two-tiered dashboard design with an available navigation system operated by Lexus’s mouse-like Remote Touch interface, while those in back enjoy more than four inches of added legroom. The ES350’s soft-spoken V-6 engine and silky six-speed automatic transmission are largely carryovers from the previous ES350, so don’t expect much of a character change from previous ES models. More significant is the addition of the first-ever hybrid to the ES lineup called ES300h, which swaps the base V-6 for a four-cylinder engine mated to supplemental electric power, resulting in a combined EPA fuel economy rating of 40 miles per gallon.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Like its most direct competitor, the BMW 3-Series, the IS is compact inside and out and is tuned to provide a clear connection between the driver and the road. Also like the 3-Series, the IS is available in hardtop convertible form. Both the IS sedan and the IS-C droptop are available with a choice of two engines: one with a miserly 204 horsepower and the other with a gutsier 306 horsepower, while all-wheel drive is offered on sedans as a boon to customers who happen to live where white stuff drops from the sky every now and then. Perched atop the IS range is the brutally fast, sedan-only IS-F, powered by a monstrous 414-horsepower V-8 and riding on a road-scraping suspension. A domed hood, two pairs of vertically stacked tailpipes, a rear spoiler, and aggressively bolstered front seats round out Lexus’s efforts to sportify the IS-F. If that seems interesting but excessive, Lexus makes some of the IS-F’s visual and handling excitement available in an F Sport package for regular IS sedans and convertibles. All that said, the IS has been around for a long time, and next to its competitors, including the redesigned BMW 3-Series and the all-new Cadillac ATS, the 2013 IS feels, well, old. A redesigned IS is expected in 2013 as a 2014 model, but in the meantime, this is as sporty as it gets at the Lexus store.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>:  7 (IS); 9 (IS-F)","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Less surprising is that this sport-utility expression of Toyota’s full-sized, San Antonio-built Tundra pickup, is more than pleasant to drive. The massive interior offers plenty of room to spread out, with a max capacity of eight hearty souls. Only one engine, a 381-horsepower V-8, does the tugging, channeling its power through a six-speed automatic, making the towing of a large travel trailer or boat an easy affair. For 2013, not much has been changed or added except for the optional navigation system (which now features Toyota’s new EnTune apps) and a new Blu-ray player for rear-seat entertainment system. Three trim levels remain on the menu: SR5, Limited, and Platinum, the latter the only Toyota other than the pish-posh Land Cruiser to cross the $60K mark. That’s a chunk of change to be sure, but particularly in its lower grades, the Sequoia offers a whole lot of truck for the money, with proven reliability to boot.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

It charms with its classic roadster styling and engaging performance. It marks the new model year with a restyled front end. The single downfall in the MX-5 Miata is space. Taller drivers may feel cramped with the top up and the narrow two-seat cabin may leave some feeling slightly claustrophobic. The trunk is Lilliputian. The base car comes with a manual-folding soft top; a power-retractable hard top is optional. The power top is the way to go if you live in a cold-weather state. It goes without saying that the MX-5 Miata is a blast to drive, even though the engine puts out a relatively modest amount of power. A 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine delivers 158 horsepower when mated with the optional six-speed automatic transmission. When equipped with the five- or six-speed manual transmission, it produces 167 horsepower. Models with the five-speed manual transmission deliver 22 mpg in city driving and 28 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. Standard features include air conditioning, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and cloth upholstery. Expect to pay in the neighborhood of around $25,000 for a base model. For many households, this means that the little roadster is an excellent choice for a second car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":29,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":58,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong>:<br/>\n1.

Introduced last year as all new, the hatchback was more of a “top hat” redesign replacing the previous Yaris’s body but not the low-powered 1.5-liter engine or the somewhat dated four-speed automatic/five-speed manual transmission choices. As a result, the Yaris is underwhelming, especially considering how strong most of its competition—namely the Ford Fiesta, Chevrolet Sonic, Hyundai Accent, and Kia Rio—has become. Not helping its cause is that it falls short of the magic 40-mpg EPA highway rating, which has become something of the gold standard against which tiny cars are measured these days. That said, the Yaris looks reasonably good, especially in five-door SE form, a trim level that also brings with it some effective performance upgrades that liven up the driving experience considerably. The interior is about as fancy as you’d expect at the sub-$15,000 price point, perhaps even less. But the Yaris does appear to have something of an airbag fetish, as no fewer than nine of the inflatables come standard, including a rare-for-the-class driver’s-side knee bag. New for 2013 is the standard fitment of last year’s audio package. Otherwise, it’s more of the same.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 3","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong>:<br/>\n1.

My first articles focused on efforts by legislators to make once heavily polluting cars run cleaner. When I moved back to Michigan, that became my focus as I contributed extensively to the Detroit bureaus of both the New York <em>Times</em> and <em>Newsweek. </em>I became fascinated by how the automobile impacts so many aspects of our lives and reflects our styles and preferences. \n\nOver the past two dozen years as a freelancer, I've covered the auto industry for a wide variety of publications, including <em>Popular Mechanics, Scientific American,</em> iVillage, A<em>utomotive News, Ad Age, Hemispheres, Technology Review,</em> and <em>AARP. </em>I've also contributed pieces on air to public radio. My coverage has focused on such issues as the ways domestic automakers will respond to increasingly tough mandates for fuel-efficient cars while still designing vehicles that appeal to consumers, and my firsthand—and slightly scary—experience driving an autonomous car.

Drivers who text while driving are six times more likely to crash than those who don't, according to a 2009 study by the University of Utah. It's difficult to determine precisely how many crashes are the direct result of texting and driving, since motorists are reluctant to admit that was the cause. But the National Safety Council found that in 2010, three percent of all crashes involved texting and driving, while 21 percent of crashes involved talking on a cell phone. Although that number may seem small, \"that risk didn't exist ten years [ago], so this is a big deal,\" said Dave Teater, the National Safety Council's senior director of transportation initiatives.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Washington State was the first to ban texting while driving, in January 2008. The penalties for violating the law vary widely, as does the enforcement. The state of Wisconsin assesses a fine of up to $400 for the first offense, while in Kentucky a first offense carries only a $25 fine. The state of New York has issued 20,000 tickets for texting while driving, but others say the laws are often difficult to enforce. A 2010 study by the Highway Loss Data Institute found no decrease in crash risk when laws against handheld cell phones were enacted. \"We don't see any evidence that texting bans are likely to make a difference in reducing crashes,\" said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"But Russ Martin, a AAA spokesman, disagrees. \"We know these laws have a significant impact on driving behavior,\" he says, pointing to laws mandating seatbelt use and drunk driving prohibitions as examples. He expects that the laws on texting and driving will ultimately have the same deterring effect, although he acknowledges that identifying drivers who text, then proving it in court, continues to be challenging.\n\nScott Kristiansen, a sergeant with the Buffalo Grove Police Department in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, knows that first hand. His state prohibits any use of electronics while driving, including texting. He says it's often difficult to see if someone is texting in a car, so he and his colleagues employ covert methods, such as having officers stand at street corners dressed as solicitors and watch people in their cars as they approach the intersection. Another tactic officers use is sitting up high in unmarked pickup trucks, from which they can look down to catch violators in their cars. He says that, as more people realize there are undercover police officers on the corners, it's likely many will change their texting behaviors.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Rader says that crash avoidance technologies being used by automakers will do far more to prevent crashes than laws banning texting while driving. One such system, forward collision warning, detects potential hazards ahead and can automatically brake if the driver doesn't react to a signal. Many car companies offer this technology under various names. Among them are Ford, Honda, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, and Volvo. Rader says the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety plans to reward manufacturers that have this available in its safety ratings, and indeed the IIHS already provides a searchable list of automakers and shows which cars have which of six forms of safety technology, including forward collision warning.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Martin agrees that these technologies could be helpful and says there is no single solution. \"Texting while driving is so ingrained in American culture. It's not a surprise people are doing it while driving,\" he says. He says a multi-pronged effort, involving driver education and strong enforcement of the law, will be the best way to prevent the practice. And these days, with everyone from AT&T to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons telling people to put the cell phone down and stop texting while driving, Martin just might get his wish.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"","images":[],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":6,"textWrap":"","type":"imagegroup","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":""}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/features/car-safety/texting-and-driving/index.html","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:30:30.389-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547430390 }} },{ "_id":223927,"title":"Parking Made Easy","subTitle":"","slug":"parking-made-easy","promoTitle":"Parking Made Easy","promoTeaserSmall":"Available active park assist helps aid parallel parking.

But even as robotically precise dual-clutch automatics and trippy continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) appear to be taking over the market, the sturdy manual trans is making a modest comeback, as I reported <a href=\"http://autoholics.com/2012/05/02/-Could-The-Manual-Be-Making-a-Comeback---632074\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">earlier this year. </a>News reports last spring showed a near doubling in the “take rate” for manual transmissions, bringing the percentage of stick-equipped cars sold to the highest it’s been in five years. This may seem odd, especially since the eventual phasing-out of the manual has long been seen as a foregone conclusion.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"So why the resurgence in interest? As it turns out, the good old stick shift has a number of enduring benefits that are, as they say, recession proof. And although there isn't a lot to say about the issue at this stage that's really news, all of us who have owned or loved a car equipped with a manual gearbox have at least a handful of ironclad reasons why they are the superior choice. Here are mine:","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>1. Mechanical simplicity.</strong> If you've done your homework, you're well versed in all the technobabble associated with the modern automatic transmission. But this is one area where it's possible to have too much of a good thing. A lot of the more cutting-edge innovations are still in their relative infancy, and driving vehicles that are so equipped, you can definitely feel it: you might think of the CVT, for example, as the new early-1990s airbag. Plus, there's no telling whether the new gadgetry will stand the test of time; as with touch screens and \"smart\" crash-avoidance systems, it’s impossible to know what kind of shape all that electronica will be in ten years down the road. While tech-loaded trannies can do some impressive things, they certainly require increasing levels of esoteric knowledge to work on, and there's something a little disconcerting about being so locked out of your own car. On some new automatics, you can't even check the fluid level anymore. By contrast, a manual gearbox is pretty much the same creature that it was forty years ago. Sure, they can come with glitchy tech, too, like hill-hold or skip-shift nannies, but for the most part these features are not integral to the unit's functioning. And unless you've ended up with the rare truly defective manual transmission, there's a whole lot less that can go wrong over the lifetime of your vehicle.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<strong>2. Extra cash.</strong> While it used to be that opting for the manual would guarantee you better gas mileage, today's computer-controlled automatics are optimized for fuel economy and shift more precisely to that end than any human being ever could. When you look at fuel mileage ratings between automatics and manuals for the same model, you'll find that, industry-wide, it's pretty much a wash: sometimes the manual still yields an edge of one or two mpg, sometimes the auto has the upper hand. So although saving money at the pump is no longer a big part of the conversation, a manual-equipped vehicle still has the ability to put extra money in your bank account at least twice during its lifetime: when you buy it, and when you get it serviced. A car with a stick shift still rings in at several hundred dollars cheaper than its automatic-equipped counterpart. The gap can become even more pronounced when you're shopping used cars, as dealers will often discount limited-market manuals deeply to move them out the door. As for service, see point number one above. A manual transmission is almost always more durable, uses fewer parts, and demands less frequent and less complicated service, and if anything ever goes seriously south, guess which unit you'd rather pay to replace.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<strong>3. Theft deterrence.</strong> Admittedly, the evidence for this claim is more anecdotal than anything, but a number of high-profile thwarted carjackings suggest that as manual proficiency declines among the general population, it becomes less and less likely that a criminal will know how to operate a vehicle so equipped. I'm more comfortable leaving my five-speed car idling unattended in my driveway than any  automatic-equipped car, because I'm confident that any malcontent passing by won't even be able to figure out how to get it out of the driveway (for one thing, I swapped in a five-speed gearbox in place of the car's original four, so the pattern depicted on the shift knob is deceitfully inaccurate, but that's another story). Car thieves look for easy targets and paths of least resistance, and a manual trans is neither.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<strong>4. Less texting.</strong> Let's face it, it's a lot harder to twiddle on your mobile device when your right hand is otherwise occupied. Or balance a venti latte. Or juggle a batch of drive-through takeout, or do any of the other dumb-driver things that put your accident risk through the roof. While the mechanical aspect of this issue is a no-brainer, the benefits of driving a manual go beyond eliminating physical distractions. It's become a cliche for enthusiasts to claim that in a manual-equipped car you’re \"more connected to the road,\" but it happens to be true: it's a different plane of driving, one that engages both your body and your mind. You become more focused; you burn more calories. Your parallel parking becomes an art form. Revolutions per minute and torque suddenly become a lot more meaningful. You're negotiating the subtle balance of throttle and clutch, <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/features/car-safety/ships-that-pass-in-the-night/\" \"target=\"_blank\">as associate editor Annie White noted,</a> and it forces you to pay more attention to traffic variables and road conditions, not to mention the propensities and limits of your particular vehicle. And since there are some things that are way harder to do when you're driving stick, like texting, you stop doing them and concentrate on the road instead.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<strong>5. Driving pleasure.</strong> As gas prices go up and family budgets go down, smaller and smaller fuel sippers are increasingly becoming the order of the day. No matter what other features you might consider important in a car, everyone wants the most fuel-efficient vehicle possible. The only problem is that, equipped with an automatic, most of these fuel-sipping compacts have about as much get up and go as a sack of rotten apples. But throw in a manual trans, and the balance of power shifts (!). Even the most apathetic and wheezy econobox will get an infusion of guts once you're able to drive it the way you want to, breathing new life into even the most lethargic commute. I mean, come on: if you can chirp the tires off the line in your Hyundai Accent, or throw a nice downshift to beat it through a yellow light when you’re five minutes away from the start of your first meeting, you know it's going to be a good day.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>Start Your Engines</h3>\nIf you don't know how to drive stick yet, don't sweat it. People always speak solemnly about how they're \"going to learn how to drive standard\" like they're working themselves up to apply to law school, but it's really not all that big a deal. While the best way to learn manual <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/features/car-safety/how-i-learned-to-drive-a-stick-shift/\" \"target=_blank\">as executive editor Laura Brown discovered</a> under duress, any immersion situation will do. Borrow a friend's manual-equipped car for a week and drive yourself to work in it every day. Or, if no one will lend you one, spend a few hundred bucks on a Craigslist junker and tool around in a parking lot until you get the hang of it (you can always sell it afterwards). And then don't be afraid to buy your forever car with the manual trans even if you haven't fully mastered it yet. When you look at the whole picture, driving manual is really just a way of beating the system while still playing by the rules. Sure, you can still be a goody two-shoes and drive a fuel-efficient car, but, by gum, you'll get some fun out of it. You'll spend less and enjoy more. And you'll get more  in all those ways that don't have anything to do with money.

Why on earth would you want someone else to drive you around when you could do it yourself? It’s so liberating! Obviously, I love driving.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

My first articles focused on efforts by legislators to make once heavily polluting cars run cleaner.

In particular, there were far fewer claims filed for vehicles that had forward collision systems with autonomous braking than for those without the technology, said HLDI vice-president Matt Moore. Yes, these active safety systems started out on higher-end vehicles, but don't rule them out if you're on a budget: they are now filtering down to more mainstream cars. There is even a chance that pedestrian-detecting technology could be common as soon as the next several years. If that’s the case, Honda is already well on the way to implementing that.

At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I really don't. The freedom of getting behind the wheel of a car and just taking off can't be compared with anything else. You really feel that you’re in charge: in charge of the car, in charge of the road, and in charge of your life. Why on earth would you want someone else to drive you around when you could do it yourself? It’s so liberating! Obviously, I love driving. I suppose that isn't a particularly original statement for a Detroit native, but it's true. I was a little late getting my driver's license because of that pesky parallel parking, but once I got it, nothing could stop me. It doesn't matter if I have to chauffeur my grandmother to the bank less than a block from our house or drive across town. If I have my green Chrysler LHS--affectionately christened \"Betsy\" by my mother--and some gas in the tank, and if I am somehow able to avoid getting pulled over for driving just a little too fast, I'm good to go.\n\nSince I graduated from the University of Michigan, in April 2012, Betsy has taken me everywhere. She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn’t as dry as a piece of chalk…And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there. Not only am I a bibliophile, but I’m also a self-proclaimed Anglophile who loves Shakespeare and Elizabethan verse and one day plans to see the Houses of Parliament, visit the Tower of London, and, perhaps most important, eat real fish and chips.

He had his seatbelt on, and we’re happy to report that he came away unscathed (apparently, the deer did, too).

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-01-11T10:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Fiat Lust","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46223934/Fiat-Lust-300.jpg","fileMasterId":46223934,"fileName":"Fiat-Lust-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":299}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-01-11T10:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Fiat Lust","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42036854/IMG-4352-622-x-350.jpg","fileMasterId":42036854,"fileName":"IMG-4352-622-x-350.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}},"pages":[{"id":246743,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>April 2002.</strong> There I was, standing in the Honda dealership with tears streaming down my face.

I really don't. The freedom of getting behind the wheel of a car and just taking off can't be compared with anything else. You really feel that you’re in charge: in charge of the car, in charge of the road, and in charge of your life. Why on earth would you want someone else to drive you around when you could do it yourself? It’s so liberating! Obviously, I love driving. I suppose that isn't a particularly original statement for a Detroit native, but it's true. I was a little late getting my driver's license because of that pesky parallel parking, but once I got it, nothing could stop me. It doesn't matter if I have to chauffeur my grandmother to the bank less than a block from our house or drive across town. If I have my green Chrysler LHS--affectionately christened \"Betsy\" by my mother--and some gas in the tank, and if I am somehow able to avoid getting pulled over for driving just a little too fast, I'm good to go.\n\nSince I graduated from the University of Michigan, in April 2012, Betsy has taken me everywhere. She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn’t as dry as a piece of chalk…And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there. Not only am I a bibliophile, but I’m also a self-proclaimed Anglophile who loves Shakespeare and Elizabethan verse and one day plans to see the Houses of Parliament, visit the Tower of London, and, perhaps most important, eat real fish and chips.

It is already being applied to products as mundane as electric toothbrushes. However, the technology is perhaps most enticing as it relates to mobile phones. There are currently thirty-four Qi-compatible mobile phones on the market, including various Nokia and HTC models, as well as Google’s Nexus 4. Denso, the supplier that created the Avalon's charging pad, says a Qi-compatible chip will be integrated into increasing numbers of phones launched in 2013 and beyond.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"If you happen to have an iPhone or another model that doesn’t support wireless charging, you can still charge your phone using the Avalon’s USB port. Or, if you’re determined to make the most of the car’s technology, you can purchase one of the aftermarket Qi-compatible cases available for many popular phones. The cases act as a bridge between the charger and phone, allowing wireless charging even in phones that aren’t compatible.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h4>How Much?</h4>The wireless charging port is available as part of the technology package, an option on both gasoline and hybrid versions of the Avalon Limited.

Qualcomm Halo (a wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm, which you may or may not know as the company that makes the processor in your smartphone) showed it off on the Rolls-Royce Phantom 102EX, an experimental EV, and defied all of these assumptions. This drool-inducing vehicle no longer had its engine. In its place was a state-of-the-art battery tricked out with Qualcomm Halo’s wireless inductive charging technology.

Charging it was a simple matter of parking – not even all that precisely – the car over the charger.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>That's Right, Charge Just by Parking on Top of the Charger</h4>\nThe idea is that these chargers will be everywhere someday. You’ll have one in your garage. They will be found at stoplights, in parking garages, taxi stands, and wherever cars tend to stop for a few minutes or a few hours. Even when you park on top of one briefly, your car will pick up a charge. If you stop for only a minute, it will get an incremental top-off; if you park for hours, it will get more. Best of all, Qualcomm claims that even this big Rolls-Royce can go 125 miles on one charge from the pad.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h4>Although, Metal = Kryptonite</h4>\nUnless, that is, something metal drops onto the charging pad.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I really don't. The freedom of getting behind the wheel of a car and just taking off can't be compared with anything else. You really feel that you’re in charge: in charge of the car, in charge of the road, and in charge of your life. Why on earth would you want someone else to drive you around when you could do it yourself? It’s so liberating! Obviously, I love driving. I suppose that isn't a particularly original statement for a Detroit native, but it's true. I was a little late getting my driver's license because of that pesky parallel parking, but once I got it, nothing could stop me. It doesn't matter if I have to chauffeur my grandmother to the bank less than a block from our house or drive across town. If I have my green Chrysler LHS--affectionately christened \"Betsy\" by my mother--and some gas in the tank, and if I am somehow able to avoid getting pulled over for driving just a little too fast, I'm good to go.\n\nSince I graduated from the University of Michigan, in April 2012, Betsy has taken me everywhere. She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn’t as dry as a piece of chalk…And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there. Not only am I a bibliophile, but I’m also a self-proclaimed Anglophile who loves Shakespeare and Elizabethan verse and one day plans to see the Houses of Parliament, visit the Tower of London, and, perhaps most important, eat real fish and chips.

A monthly payment of $300 to $400 for a purchase wouldn’t be feasible, but a monthly lease payment of $150 or $200 would be, especially if she leased her next car from Chrysler, a company that has a proven track record with her. “I’ve had success with leases in the past, and that was when I actually did have a commute,” Mom said. “The mileage limit shouldn’t pose a problem now, and it will allow me to be prudent with my car expenses.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":19,"text":"I dragged my mother off car shopping the second weekend in January.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

They are based on your payment history, how much debt you're currently carrying,  types of credit you've used and the length of your credit history, and new credit you've just taken on. There are three bureaus that provide credit scores: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. You can check your score for free using any of a variety of online credit check services to get an idea of what lenders will see when they pull up your credit history.

If you spot something inaccurate on a credit report, get in touch with the reporting agency and dispute the entry right away.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Only the borrowers with the best credit will get the best rates, so even if a manufacturer is advertising aggressive rates, you will need to expect to pay more if you're carrying a low credit score. So ads offering zero percent financing or other great deals might not be available to you if you don't have an excellent credit history. The closer your score is to the high end of the range, the lower your interest rates are likely to be.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"If your credit score is particularly bad, it might be worth trying to raise it before you apply for financing on a car. It will take time, but it could also help you save hundreds or even thousands of dollars on interest over the life of a loan. To move the needle on your credit score, pay down credit card balances, make sure there's nothing wrong on your credit report, and make sure you pay on time. In the meantime, a low credit score does not mean you can't buy a car, just that it will probably cost you more to do it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Check back in tomorrow for part two, when we'll talk about interest rates and where to shop for loans.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:31:26.448-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547486448 }} },{ "_id":341059,"title":"The Amelia Island Concours on Video","subTitle":"","slug":"amelia-island-video","promoTitle":"The Amelia Island Concours on Video","promoTeaserSmall":"Where I go in March to find the best collectible cars and the best people.","promoTeaser":"Where I go in March to find the best collectible cars and the best people.","keywords":["Amelia Island Video"],"metaTitle":"The Amelia Island Concours on Video - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance","Amelia Island","Concours d'Elegance","collector cars","Ritz-Carlton","vintage cars"],"metaDescription":"The Amelia Island Concours on Video.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Reviews","id":1023765,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos/car-reviews","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"All Videos","id":1023756,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-05T09:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Amelia Island","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44802682/Amelia-Island-300.jpg","fileMasterId":44802682,"fileName":"Amelia-Island-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-04T13:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"amelia-island","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45281609/Amelia-04.jpg","fileMasterId":45281609,"fileName":"Amelia-04.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}},"pages":[{"id":461207,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance in Florida each March is a place to see some of the great cars and great personalities of automotive history.
