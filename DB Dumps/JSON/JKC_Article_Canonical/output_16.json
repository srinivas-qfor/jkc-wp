I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Designer Walkaround","id":1034952,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-16T06:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cadillac-ct6-promolarge","title":"Cadillac Ct6 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/107297339/cadillac-ct6-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":107297339,"fileName":"cadillac-ct6-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-16T06:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cadillac-ct6-promolarge","title":"Cadillac Ct6 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/107297339/cadillac-ct6-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":107297339,"fileName":"cadillac-ct6-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-16T06:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cadillac-ct6-header","title":"Cadillac Ct6 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/107297156/cadillac-ct6-header.jpg","fileMasterId":107297156,"fileName":"cadillac-ct6-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":935909,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Cadillac’s exterior design manager, Taki Karras,  met me at the New York Auto Show to walk me around the 2016 CT6, on my short list of must-see cars.

This nimble little truck gets great gas mileage—24 mpg in the city, where you will likely be doing most of your work. It is designed to be easy to fit the things you are likely to want it to carry: pallets, doors, a six-foot stepladder, and the like. And the rear doors open wide—with a 60/40 split—to make whatever you haul around easily accessible. The back is tricked out with connection rings and mounts to make retrofitting it for shelving systems, racks, or other organization or storage systems easy. Shelving and storage accessories can also be purchased from Chevrolet. The cargo volume is an impressive 122.7 cubic feet.<br><br>\n \nThe passenger area is basic, but it has what you need to get the job done. A twelve-volt outlet lets you keep your laptop running all day long. Thirteen storage spaces and a front passenger's seat that folds flat to make something like a desk turns that driving area into a small office on the move. There are plenty of options for making the exterior look just the way you want as well, so this van can represent and advertise your business as you work.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe City Express is an all-new vehicle for 2015.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Chevrolet City Express interior","fileMasterId":107678387,"fileName":"chevrolet-cityexpress-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/107678387/chevrolet-cityexpress-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Chevrolet City Express","fileMasterId":107678384,"fileName":"chevrolet-cityexpress-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/107678384/chevrolet-cityexpress-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Chevrolet City Express","fileMasterId":107678381,"fileName":"chevrolet-cityexpress-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/107678381/chevrolet-cityexpress-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Chevrolet City Express","fileMasterId":107678378,"fileName":"chevrolet-cityexpress-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/107678378/chevrolet-cityexpress-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45467,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"City Express","year":2015},{"id":"8bfe9141-264d-3530-adde-b612c376b580","type":"mediaTag","name":"Trucks","path":"/Main/Trucks"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:18.498-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547718499 }} },{ "_id":679823,"title":"2015 Chevrolet Spark","subTitle":"This subcompact is cartoon tiny and comes in vivid, cartoon colors.","slug":"2015-chevrolet-spark","promoTitle":"2015 Chevrolet Spark","promoTeaserSmall":"This subcompact is cartoon tiny and comes in vivid, cartoon colors.","promoTeaser":"This subcompact is cartoon tiny and comes in vivid, cartoon colors.","keywords":["2015 Chevrolet Spark"],"metaTitle":"2015 Chevrolet Spark","metaKeywords":["2015 Chevrolet Spark; Chevrolet; Chevy; hatchback; American"],"metaDescription":"This subcompact is cartoon tiny and comes in vivid, cartoon colors.

Connect your phone via Bluetooth and access apps on the touchscreen display. Listen to Pandora, use BringGo for navigation, let Siri Eyes Free handle calls, searches, contacts, and everything else that might tempt you to look at your phone. An auxiliary power outlet in the center stack keeps your devices running. Passengers (or you, when parked) can use the car as a Wi-Fi hot spot thanks to OnStar with 4G LTE, which is capable of connecting up to seven devices.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

For 2015, there are optional modifications to the fuel supply system to gain Partial Zero Emission Vehicle status for Darts in the fourteen California Air Resources Board states. The Dart Aero has a turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder that can be matched with a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, taking advantage of the strong output of 160 horsepower and—best of the Dart bunch—184 pound-feet of torque. The Aero has active grille shutters and special underbody cladding to improve aerodynamic efficiency. (The active shutters are also standard on the GT and Limited and optional on SE and SXT.) A special badge and LED “racetrack” taillamps help distinguish the Aero. Inside, the Aero gets an 8.4-inch touchscreen display, a sharp-looking and customizable TFT instrument panel, and essential iPod and USB ports.

The available 5.7-liter V-8 produces 360 horsepower and an impressive 390 pound-feet of torque, yet because of cylinder deactivation it can operate as a V-4 engine under light loads for greater efficiency. There’s a long list of standard and optional safety, security, and convenience features. Splendid appointments and luxuries abound, as well. A seven-inch TFT instrument panel display is standard in all models. New this year, the available Beats by Dre audio system delivers premium sound via a twelve-channel amplifier and ten speakers.

Upgrades include heated and ventilated seats, leather everything, crash avoidance systems, and parking assist. When you pair OnStar with the head-up display, you will never get lost again. What truly sets the CTS apart from its competitors on the market is its styling. Its exterior sculpting is somewhat masculine, but it’s also subdued enough to appeal to those looking for a distinctive luxury vehicle that stands out from the crowd (read: doesn’t want to be a BMW, Audi, or Mercedes). Despite this muscular appearance, the 2015 CTS is the lightest car in its class, which means it drives like a sports car but still delivers on luxury and technology.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nWireless phone charger, perpendicular parking assist added to the parking assist system, new interior color and trim

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

But storage and seating is the real reason you want an SUV, and this one seats five and offers plenty of cargo space and clever places to stash your miscellany, including that cleverly redesigned center console.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nRedesigned exterior and interior; more efficient and powerful 2.4-liter engine; seven-inch touchscreen display with smartphone-like functionality, active safety features, and a new Touring trim","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Honda CR-V interior","fileMasterId":111060770,"fileName":"honda-crv-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111060770/honda-crv-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Honda CR-V","fileMasterId":111061040,"fileName":"honda-crv-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111061040/honda-crv-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Honda CR-V","fileMasterId":111060767,"fileName":"honda-crv-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111060767/honda-crv-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Honda CR-V","fileMasterId":111061037,"fileName":"honda-crv-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111061037/honda-crv-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the CR-V</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/2015-honda-cr-v-awd/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Should You Buy It? 2015 Honda CR-V AWD</a>","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43493,"make":"Honda","model":"CR-V","year":2015},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:22.652-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547722653 }} },{ "_id":685706,"title":"2015 Jaguar XK","subTitle":"A last blast for Jaguar’s grand tourer.","slug":"2015-jaguar-xk","promoTitle":"2015 Jaguar XK","promoTeaserSmall":"A last blast for Jaguar’s grand tourer.","promoTeaser":"A last blast for Jaguar’s grand tourer.","keywords":["2015 Jaguar XK"],"metaTitle":"2015 Jaguar XK","metaKeywords":["2015 Jaguar XK; Jaguar; coupe; convertible; British"],"metaDescription":"A last blast for Jaguar’s grand tourer.

In addition, Jaguar is producing a special edition of the XK called the Final Fifty, with performance upgrades and special styling touches.  There will be 50 Final Fiftys built (no surprise, that), 25 convertibles and 25 coupes. The only available color is Ultimate Black. \r\n<br><br>\r\nEvery two-plus-two, rear-wheel-drive XK comes with a powerful V-8 engine. The base XK get a normally aspirated V-8 with a substantial 385 horsepower. The V-8s in the XKR and XKR-S models are supercharged and produce an even more substantial—a blazing fast—510 and 550 horsepower, respectively. In any XK, all you need to do is stomp on the accelerator pedal to give yourself a thrill ride. However, what the XK really excels at is grand touring. Find a twisty road, roll down the windows or lower the convertible top (which can be accomplished in 18 seconds), and savor the pure fun of being behind the wheel. On the other hand, if that twisty road happens to be the Nürburgring or a racetrack, you can really go for it, especially if you’re in the XKR-S, which reaches 60 mph in a scant 4.2 seconds and tops out at more than 180 mph.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLike all Jaguars, the interior of the XK can be outfitted in a variety of veneers and leather furnishings, all of which are of top-notch quality and deliver the luxury you would expect.  The touch-screen interface isn’t as advanced or as user-friendly as what you’ll find in other luxury marques, but it works well enough. In addition, the “plus two” accommodations are cramped—we’d suggest limiting occupants to a driver and one passenger, and leaving the back seat for storage.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"\r\n<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nTrim levels have been simplified, and standard equipment and option packages have been reconfigured.

The F-type is a true two-seat sports car, one that can compete on an even playing field with the likes of Porsches and Corvettes, BMW M cars and Mercedes-Benz AMGs. For 2015, there is more to love about the F-type, as a coupe joins the convertible that debuted as a 2014 model.\n<br><br>\nThe base F-type is powered by a 3.0-liter supercharged V-6 that makes 340 horsepower. There is plenty of standard equipment on the base model, including automatic xenon headlights (with washers!), full power accessories (seats, windows, mirrors), a tilt-and-telescope steering wheel, 18-inch wheels, and a touchscreen display to control various vehicular functions. Stepping up one level to the F-type S gets you the same V-6 but with 40 more horses, 19-inch wheels, larger brakes, an active sport exhaust, and Dynamic Launch Mode for track days. Both the base F-type and the S models are available as a coupe or a convertible.\n<br><br>\nThe top-of-the-line convertible is the F-type V8 S, which has a 495-hp, supercharged V-8, 20-inch wheels, even larger 15-inch brakes, full leather, and 12-way adjustable seats with power lumbar support. At the very top of the F-type range is the new R coupe, whose supercharged 550-hp V-8 will power to 60 mph in a scant 4.0 seconds. The R coupe’s interior is trimmed with faux-carbon-fiber accents, a flat-bottom steering wheel, and metal brake and accelerator pedals. \n<br><br>\nYou may have noticed that there are only two pedals, but wait for 2016, when a six-speed manual will be available, though only on V-6 models with rear-wheel drive. Yes, all-wheel drive will also be an option for 2016.\n<br><br>\nAll of that doesn’t mean that you should wait for the 2016 models, though. The 2015\nF-type is a top-notch sports car that handles with precision and is a blast to drive. One word of warning—all that handling comes courtesy of a fairly stiff suspension that can knock you around a bit on uneven pavement, but we think that’s a sacrifice worth making.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe Jaguar F-type is available as a coupe for 2015.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

It is named for its boxer (horizontally opposed) four-cylinder engine and its rear-wheel drive. Known for its low center of gravity and no-frills fun to drive, the BRZ is <em>not</em> known for its luggage capacity (a whopping 6.9 cubic feet of cargo volume) or its back-seat comfort.

The Premium doesn't have any of these, even as options. All BRZs get Starlink infotainment with a 6.2-inch screen, Sirius XM satellite radio, and smartphone integration. One option is the six-speed automatic transmission with manual mode and paddle shifters, which adds $1,000 to the price and improves fuel economy.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-11T19:41:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"toyota-prius-promolarge","title":"Toyota Prius Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/114029660/toyota-prius-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":114029660,"fileName":"toyota-prius-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-11T19:41:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"toyota-prius-promolarge","title":"Toyota Prius Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/114029660/toyota-prius-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":114029660,"fileName":"toyota-prius-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-11T19:41:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"toyota-prius-header","title":"Toyota Prius Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/92019565/toyota-prius-header.jpg","fileMasterId":92019565,"fileName":"toyota-prius-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":949993,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRYX0lmp7Qo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger hybrid hatchback<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong>  $26,590 (including destination)<br>\n<strong>Price as tested:</strong> $28,315 (including destination)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 1.8-liter four-cylinder/electric motor/nickel-metal hydride battery, 134 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Continuously variable automatic<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Toyota Prius 01","caption":"","fileMasterId":114029513,"fileName":"toyota-prius-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/114029513/toyota-prius-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Safety ratings:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Search-Results?searchtype=model&make=TOYOTA&model=PRIUS&year=2015\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">4/5 stars</a>;

Touch sensors on the steering wheel switches display a duplicate image on the instrument panel in driver’s line of sight to reduce distraction.<br>\n• <strong>What’s up next for Toyota?</strong> The automaker will be taking green to the next level with the 2016 Toyota Mirai fuel-cell vehicle. It will start at $58,325 and comes to U.S. dealers in the fall. <br>\n• Additional markets will follow as the hydrogen refueling structure in the U.S.

The standard 6-speed manual gearbox can be ordered with a feature that blips the throttle for smooth downshifts. The available 7-speed automatic comes with a similar feature. While even the base model has great brakes, the 370Z Nismo has even more powerful ones to go with a specially braced and tuned suspension and viscous limited-slip differential for that extra edge in handling. The 370Z Roadster has a power-operated, fully automatic top in black or Bordeaux with a fabric liner and glass rear window with integrated defroster.

Consider just a few examples. The stereo speakers are mounted in die-cast aluminum frames. Rather than iron sleeves, the V-6 engine’s cylinder bores have low-friction plasma coatings. The engine cover is a work of art, suitable for framing.  This year, much attention was given to retuning the suspension components and brakes with the goal of better drivability around town. Who knows? The lucky owner of a GT-R might utilize the 8.8 cubic feet of cargo capacity for a trip to Costco. Additional sound deadening measures have also been taken, and active noise cancellation counteracts booming from the twin-turbo V-6, which produces 545-horsepower (600-horsepower in the GT-R Nismo).  Being capable of 196 mph, the GT-R boasts one of the most aero-efficient bodies (0.26 cd) thanks in part to the carefully designed rear spoiler and undertrays, and now the GT-R Black Edition features a handmade, specially coated carbon-fiber spoiler. For that shopping trip, the driver might tame the GT-R with the 6-speed dual-clutch gearbox’s Normal or Save mode, and wait to use the paddle shifters and rev matching when R-Mode is engaged on track day. New for 2015 and typical of the obsessive details we mentioned, the available Regal Red body color blends 24-karat gold-coated glass flakes into the paint. And the Ivory Premium Package interior covers the seats in hand-stitched, semi-aniline leather, which is also applied on the instrument panel, steering wheel, and shift knob. The GT-R Black Edition has a red-and-black interior with leather-covered Recaro front bucket seats.

(It was about 10 years ago.) The Juke’s unusual face and profile eventually work their charms, and then you’re won over by subtle details like the rear door handles, which are integrated into the doorframe. Standing tall on large wheels, this little hotrod is playful and insouciant. And then there’s the driving experience. The Juke punches above its weight with a direct-injection, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, revised this year for better fuel economy, improved responsiveness, and lower emissions. It’s paired with a continuously variable transmission with a sport mode. Not only does the Juke bustle right down the road, but it also gives a Bronx cheer when passing gas stations. This five-seater is a front-wheel-drive vehicle with available all-wheel drive and up to 35.9 cubic feet of cargo space. The Juke S is well equipped with desirable feature content: connectivity and audio are strong points. The upmarket models add such items as a sunroof, leather, premium audio, and a 360-degree view. And you still haven’t spent a lot of money!

The Titan is offered in extended King Cab or Crew Cab body styles with rear- or available 4-wheel drive. Boasting the largest standard engine among full-size pickups, this workhorse will tow up to 9,500 pounds. It includes traction control and stability control for surefire hill climbing and cornering on slick roads. The locking removable tailgate is a nifty standard feature, and the available locking bedside storage compartment and Utili-track cargo carrying system enhance the cargo box’s usefulness. Inside its cab, the Titan masters the pickup category’s mobile office requirements; the center-console’s workstation is as versatile and convenient as they come, and the front passenger seat folds flat for what serves as a desk. In back of either King or Crew Cab, the 60/40-split rear seats flip up to provide extra cargo space. The SV Value package puts the Titan on 20-inch wheels, hangs step rails on the cab, and places captain’s chairs in the front row. Then it piles on the infotainment and connectivity features. The PRO-4X girds the Titan for rock-busting duty, adding a transfer case skid plates, and high-performance shock absorbers. For all its virtues, though, the Titan runs far behind the pack in fuel economy, so be prepared to frequent the pump.

That is no longer true. Case in point: the Mazda 3. The 3 is Mazda’s best-selling vehicle in the United States, and while it sits as the low end of the brand’s model line, it now offers features like pushbutton start, a rear-view camera, power seats, and multimedia connectivity, which were previously reserved for more upscale models.\n<br><br>\nWhat is even more important, though, is that the Mazda 3 is fun to drive. With excellent acceleration, a balanced suspension, and sharp steering and braking, the Mazda 3 is among the most enjoyable compact cars to drive on a day-to-day basis. The 155-horsepower, 2.0-liter and 184-horsepower, 2.5-liter engines can be paired with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic. You’ll get slightly better mileage with the automatic, but the manual offers you the chance to have the kind of interactive driving experience that an automatic just can’t match. For maximum fuel efficiency, Mazda offers an optional i-ELOOP regenerative braking system that converts the car’s kinetic energy to electricity as soon as the accelerator is released.\n<br><br>\nThe Mazda 3 is available as either a four-door sedan or a four-door hatchback. There are four trim levels, each of which is preceded by an i (2.0-liter) or an s (2.5-liter), depending on the engine. The sedan has a sizable 12.4-cubic-foot trunk, but for maximum cargo flexibility opt for the hatchback, which has 20.2 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats, and 47.1 cubic feet with the back row folded flat.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nA manual transmission can now be paired with the 2.5-liter engine.

There will be a small sacrifice in fuel efficiency (about 1 mpg), but the extra power will be welcome when merging and passing. There are two available transmissions—a six-speed automatic that can be had in any trim level and a six-speed manual that is only available with the 2.0-liter engine. You can also order your CX-5 with either front- or all-wheel drive. \n<br><br>\nThe CX-5 is available in three trim levels, starting with the Sport and moving up to the Touring and Grand Touring. No matter which you pick, you’ll find that the CX-5 exhibits better steering, braking, and suspension balance than you might expect from a vehicle in this class.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe 2.5-liter engine replaces the 2.0-liter on Sport all-wheel-drive models and keyless entry and ignition are now standard on the Touring and Grand Touring.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda CX-5","fileMasterId":115009814,"fileName":"mazda-cx5-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115009814/mazda-cx5-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda CX-5","fileMasterId":115009811,"fileName":"mazda-cx5-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115009811/mazda-cx5-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43593,"make":"Mazda","model":"CX-5","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:27.482-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547727482 }} },{ "_id":687680,"title":"2015 Porsche 911","subTitle":"Life begins at fifty.","slug":"2015-porsche-911","promoTitle":"2015 Porsche 911","promoTeaserSmall":"Life begins at fifty.","promoTeaser":"Life begins at fifty.","keywords":["2015 Porsche 911"],"metaTitle":"2015 Porsche 911","metaKeywords":["2015 Porsche 911; Porsche; Carrera; Targa; coupe; convertible; German"],"metaDescription":"Life begins at fifty.

Everything about the 911 has become more civilized in the last fifty years, but it has remained true to its sports car roots. There are seemingly innumerable variations of the 911 to appeal to enthusiast drivers of all stripes. It can be had as a hard-top coupe, a soft-top convertible (Cabriolet), or a retractable roof coupe (Targa). It comes in rear- or four-wheel drive, and its six-cylinder engine can be either normally aspirated or turbocharged. All 911s (except for the two-seat, track-focused GT3) are two-plus-twos—which comes in handy when ferrying small children or a set of golf clubs—but this sports car is really most comfortable with no more than two passengers. \n<br><br>\nThe base model is the rear-wheel-drive 911 Carrera, powered by a 350-horsepower, 3.4-liter six-cylinder engine. The 911 Carrera 4 is virtually identical to the base model, except with all-wheel drive. Moving one step up the model chart to the Carrera S and Carrera 4S gets you a 3.8-liter engine that makes 400 horsepower. Power improves incrementally from there, topping out at a truly impressive 560 horsepower in the 911 Turbo S. There are two available transmissions, a seven-speed manual and a seven-speed PDK automatic. Sadly for those who prefer a three-pedal setup, the PDK is the only transmission in the three highest-end 911s: GT3, Turbo, and Turbo S. (Porsche argues that the PDK is faster than a manual, and therefore the right choice for its highest-performance models. We beg to differ.)\n<br><br>\nThe 911 starts at a little more than $85,000 and comes with a fair amount of standard equipment, including bi-xenon headlights, rear parking sensors, heated mirrors, dual-zone climate control, leather upholstery, navigation, and Bluetooth. Be careful when selecting options, as Porsche is notorious for its hefty fees for add-ons—$4,000 plus for the PDK automatic, $8,500 for ceramic composite brakes, several thousand dollars for various interior finishes. They even charge you $300 for putting the name of the car on the doors. In other words, you’ll be hard-pressed to leave the dealership with a 911 that costs less than six figures. \n<br><br>\nHowever, that cost is about the only thing that might dampen your enthusiasm for the 911, a car that, even fifty years on, is the very definition of sports car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nThe 430-horsepower 911 GTS is added to the lineup for 2015, as is an optional rearview camera.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Porsche 911 interior","fileMasterId":115619486,"fileName":"porsche-911-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115619486/porsche-911-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Porsche 911","fileMasterId":115619483,"fileName":"porsche-911-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115619483/porsche-911-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Porsche 911","fileMasterId":115619480,"fileName":"porsche-911-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115619480/porsche-911-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":40763,"make":"Porsche","model":"911","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:27.759-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547727760 }} },{ "_id":687686,"title":"2015 Porsche Macan","subTitle":"The Cayenne’s peppy little brother.","slug":"2015-porsche-macan","promoTitle":"2015 Porsche Macan","promoTeaserSmall":"The Cayenne’s peppy little brother.","promoTeaser":"The Cayenne’s peppy little brother.","keywords":["2015 Porsche Macan"],"metaTitle":"2015 Porsche Macan","metaKeywords":["2015 Porsche Macan; Porsche; SUV; sport-utility; crossover; German"],"metaDescription":"The Cayenne’s peppy little brother.

The Macan went on sale for the 2015 model year, and so far the only problem is that Porsche can’t build enough of them. In fact, the only Porsche that outsells the Macan is the Cayenne. \n<br><br>\nThe fact that two SUVs sit atop the sales sheet doesn’t mean that Porsche has abandoned its sports car roots, though. Take the Macan on a curvy road, and it displays razor-sharp handling, with minimal body roll and exceptional turn-in. The cabin is comfortable and well put together, with quality materials and construction. All of the important controls are within easy reach, although the plethora of buttons on the center console can be confusing. \n<br><br>\nThe base model is the Macan S, which has a 340-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 and comes standard with nineteen-inch wheels shod with all-season tires, an eleven-speaker audio system, a seven-inch TFT display, Bluetooth, three-zone automatic climate control, bi-xenon headlights, a multi-function sport steering wheel, piano black interior trim, split-folding rear seats, a power tailgate, and 17.7 cubic feet of storage capacity behind the rear seats (53.0 cubic feet with the rear seats folded).\n<br><br>\nThe Turbo model gets a more powerful engine, adaptive damping, unique wheels, full leather upholstery, and an upgraded audio system. You can get some of the Turbo’s standard features as options on the Macan S, and there is also an extensive standalone options list for both models that includes high-tech performance items like torque vectoring, active suspension management, and ceramic composite brakes.\n<br><br>\nSo far, the Macan has been a huge success for Porsche. In fact, most of the German automaker’s sales gains over the past year can be traced directly to this new model. Porsche recently stated that it would start ramping up production of the Macan.

In fact, the Versa Note, which was introduced for 2014, looked so good, we wondered why there wasn’t a dedicated sport model. This year, in addition to the high-trim Versa Note SL, there is now a Note SR. Unfortunately, the SR doesn’t have a turbocharged engine to put muscle behind the sporty look, only the same normally aspirated 1.6-liter four cylinder making 109 horsepower as the other models. Otherwise, the SR sure does fill the part, with a unique, dark headlight accents, fog lamps, and a whisking tail topped by a rear spoiler. Inside, the seats are covered in faux suede, and the standard level of infotainment and connectivity is high. There’s also a rearview monitor and a clever adjustable load floor in the cargo area. The new Note SL rides on handsome 16-inch alloy wheels and is loaded with features like a smart key with push-button start and a class-exclusive 360-degree monitor.

About once a month, and definitely before leaving on a road trip, use a tire pressure gauge and make sure you have the right amount of air in your tires. The maximum pressure will be printed on the doorjamb of the driver’s door, and also on the front of the tire itself, near where the tire meets the wheel. Check tire pressure early in the day on cool tires; pressure will go up with heat, giving an inaccurate reading. Using a tire pressure gauge is easy; take the valve cap off each tire, place the gauge onto the stem, and press down until the tire stops hissing and you get a reading from the gauge, either on a bar or a digital screen.

That’s a nod to the fact that tires are less likely to fail than they used to be; in fact, 85 percent of spare tires never get used at all. But....do you want to be out on an unfamiliar highway without a change of tire this summer? Probably not. Make sure you have at least a temporary spare on board, and get it checked to make sure it will work in a pinch. Even better, practice changing the tire so you know how. (And make your household’s teenage drivers do the same, if you have them.) If you have a temporary spare, read the directions. Usually you shouldn’t drive more than 50 mph and no more than 50 miles on it if you do have to use it. It’s really just to get you to a place where you can get a full-size tire put back on.

You do that by finding the little yellow icon of a person at bottom right of your screen, then dragging it over to the place you want to see up close.  Now that you are viewing the location in Street View, look at the top left corner of the screen; if you see a clock face icon, click on it to see images from past Street View image sweeps of the location. It's fun to see how a neighborhood or cityscape has changed in just a few years, or how it looks at different seasons.

The cashier hands me my strawberry ice cream and, because, the Baskin-Robbins is connected to a Dunkin' Donuts, he also feeds a leftover doughnut hole to Clem. At this point, my dog has half his body out of the car window. We love this ritual and drive away happy as clams, but I haven't really thought about any safety implications for my pup. Heck, if I had a dime for every time Clem or our other six-month-old black Lab, Brick, jumped into my lap, crawled over a seat, or unknowingly tried to climb out the window while I was driving, I’d be a wealthy woman.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>I Thought My Dog Crate Was Crash Tested?</h3>\nPet crate manufacturers have increasingly labeled their products as “crash tested,” but what does that really mean? According to Lindsey Wolko, founder and CEO of the Center for Pet Safety, it doesn’t mean much. “Just because a product has been crash tested, without a formal test protocol and ratings guidelines, there is nothing to use to measure a ‘pass,’” Wolko says. “It’s simply more market hype.” The fact is that pet safety equipment has not been tested using rigorous safety standards, and that's exactly what this Subaru/Center for Pet Safety effort is trying to change.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"“We want to make pet parents aware of safety measures they can take to help protect their pets,” says Subaru's Michael McHale.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

None of the networks offers coverage for trucks, sports cars, or large vans, and three out of four will not cover vehicles priced over $50,000.

Loss of use and the deductible on your own insurance policy are covered by every company except Discover.

The base model, the CLA250, is equipped with front-wheel drive—all-wheel drive is optional—and a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produces 208 horsepower. Price-wise, it may be the most accessible of the Mercedes lineup, but it has a long list of standard features including a 12-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, a seven-inch LCD display, ambient lighting, Bluetooth audio streaming and mobile phone integration. Also standard on this bargain Benz is the advanced Collision Prevention system—typically an expensive option—that applies the brakes to avoid an impending crash with another car and the drowsy-driving detecting Attention Assist system. Rounding out the semi-autonomous vehicle technology is the optional parking assist system that uses sensors to help you parallel or perpendicular park, which is notable since these advanced features are rarely an option in entry-level vehicles. That said, most creature comforts you’ve come to expect are optional, including heated seats, navigation, and voice-activation. And while the standard MBrace integrates your mobile phone with your car’s infotainment system, getting any of the approved apps to appear in the LCD or integrate with the system controls requires you to pony up for a monthly subscription, which is easy to pass on since you shouldn’t be playing with your phone that much anyway. Another interesting option: an in-dash DVD/CD player that allows you to watch DVDs while the car is in park. As with any low-slung coupe (four-doors or otherwise), you don’t buy it for its rear seat. But the inclusion of two cupholders in the fold-down center armrest is a nice touch of comfort for the back-seat passengers whose heads are likely butting up against the sloping roofline.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nNew steering wheel design and changes to package features.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz CLA-class interior","fileMasterId":127526207,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-claclass-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/127526207/mercedesbenz-claclass-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz CLA-class","fileMasterId":127526447,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-claclass-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/127526447/mercedesbenz-claclass-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz CLA-class","fileMasterId":127526204,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-claclass-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/127526204/mercedesbenz-claclass-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz CLA-class","fileMasterId":127526444,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-claclass-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/127526444/mercedesbenz-claclass-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43106,"make":"Mercedes-Benz","model":"CLA-Class","year":2015},{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:34.217-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547734218 }} },{ "_id":691891,"title":"2015 Mercedes-Benz E-Class","subTitle":"A wide range of body styles and power choices in a car that is the heart of the Mercedes lineup.","slug":"2015-mercedes-benz-e-class","promoTitle":"2015 Mercedes-Benz E-Class","promoTeaserSmall":"A wide range of body styles and power choices in a car that is the heart of the Mercedes lineup.","promoTeaser":"A wide range of body styles and power choices in a car that is the heart of the Mercedes lineup.","keywords":["2015 Mercedes-Benz E-Class"],"metaTitle":"2015 Mercedes-Benz E-Class - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["2015 Mercedes-Benz E-class;

Most buyers will probably opt for the more conventional twin-turbo V-6 or 4.7-liter V-8 that occupy the middle of the engine range. Regardless of which engine you choose, there will be plenty of power and torque to haul your family, its gear, and a sporting craft to any reasonable destination. The interior and cargo area are generous as well. It has three rows of seats and can seat up to seven. Legroom is mercifully spacious in every row of this luxury liner, with 40.3-, 38.5-, and 35.0-inches in the front, second, and third rows, respectively.  Cargo capacity isn’t lacking despite its three-row configuration with 16 cubic feet of storage with all three rows in use and 49.4 cubic feet with the third row folded flat: plenty of room to tote around that double wide jogging stroller and the dog. True to its luxury brand, it’s well equipped with many standard creature comforts and safety features, such as heated front seats, the Comand infotainment system, a power liftgate, a drowsy driving warning system.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-07-27T07:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mazda-miata-promolarge","title":"Mazda Miata Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132171980/mazda-miata-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":132171980,"fileName":"mazda-miata-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-07-27T07:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mazda-miata-promolarge","title":"Mazda Miata Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132171980/mazda-miata-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":132171980,"fileName":"mazda-miata-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-07-27T07:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mazda-miata-header","title":"Mazda Miata Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132171761/mazda-miata-header.jpg","fileMasterId":132171761,"fileName":"mazda-miata-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":958341,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8vSW5rRJcM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata Grand Touring MT</h3>\n<strong>Type:</strong> Two-passenger, rear-wheel-drive convertible<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $25,735 (base Sport model, including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $30,885 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, 155 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed manual<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong>  27 mpg city/34 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Folding convertible top <br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> i-Activsense package, including lane departure warning, rear cross-traffic alert, blind spot monitoring; Mazda Connect infotainment with voice command; nine-speaker Bose audio with headrest speakers; heated seats; seventeen-inch wheels; LED daylight running lights and headlamps<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Keyless entry (standard on automatic-transmission model) <br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> 2015 Mini Cooper Convertible ($26,550); 2015 Porsche Boxster ($52,395)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>Key Points:</h3>\r\n• The MX-5 is wider, lower, and lighter than the outgoing car.<br>\r\n• Key exterior design cues include a low hood, blacked-out A-pillars and mirrors, and exterior LED lights.<br>\r\n• Interestingly, it makes 12 horsepower <em>less</em> than the 2015 model.<br>\r\n• The 2016 model has significantly improved fuel economy of 25 percent versus 2015 Miata, due to a weight reduction of approximately 150 pounds.

Personally, my confidence behind the wheel is inversely related to how much my passengers care about my driving. I can parallel park in downtown Birmingham without so much as a wrinkled forehead when my best friend is in the car, but when my dad sits in the front seat I struggle to even go the speed limit. Give yourself and your young driver a much-needed pressure relief.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"<strong>2.

Starting as a way to market higher-end used cars, the Certified Pre-Owned designation has now become commonplace at car dealerships. A Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) car is generally a car with a clean history, few past users, of relatively recent vintage, and with less than about 80,000 miles on the odometer. It undergoes an extensive pre-sale inspection, and problems are fixed by the dealer before it's offered for sale. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"What's not to like?

All CPO programs aren't alike.</h3> Manufacturers run Certified Pre-Owned programs, but so do some dealers as well as organizations such as Enterprise car rental, the National Independent Automobile Dealers Association (NIADA), and others. You need to understand where the Certified Pre-Owned designation is coming from. The big advantage of seeking out a CPO used car, rather than any old car on the lot, is that the CPO car comes with a warranty. You want it to be the manufacturer’s own warranty, not the local dealer’s. Why? If the CPO program is through the manufacturer, not just the local dealership, any warranty repairs you do need can be performed anywhere around the country. That's a strong argument in favor of the automaker's program.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Certified 01","caption":"","fileMasterId":137598113,"fileName":"certified-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/137598113/certified-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":4,"text":"<h3>2.

Earlier this summer, electric-sports-car maker Tesla started online sales of Certified Pre-Owned Model S cars that are starting to come back from lease programs.

Ahrens","firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Ahrens","jobTitle":"Contributing Writer","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"When <em>Automobile</em> launched in 1986, my byline appeared on a sidebar to the cover story written by our founding editor David E. Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"New Car Features","id":1034782,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/new-car-features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-28T08:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cvt-promolarge","title":"Cvt Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/139567979/cvt-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":139567979,"fileName":"cvt-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-28T08:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cvt-promolarge","title":"Cvt Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/139567979/cvt-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":139567979,"fileName":"cvt-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-28T08:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cvt-header","title":"Cvt Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/139567895/cvt-header.jpg","fileMasterId":139567895,"fileName":"cvt-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":962471,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Cvt Illo","caption":"","fileMasterId":139570277,"fileName":"cvt-illo.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/139570277/cvt-illo.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":0,"text":"Did you know that about thirteen percent of new cars come equipped with a continuously variable transmission? To many people—possibly including you—that technology is an enigma. If you’ve heard anything about the CVT, it's likely that your feelings about it have been affected by the harsh opinions of hard-core car enthusiasts and late adopters, who may dislike or just distrust this type of automatic transmission.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Who likes CVTs? Auto companies, for a start. CVTs are currently available in vehicles from Audi, Honda, Hyundai, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Suzuki, and Toyota. General Motors and Chrysler are customers for the CVT made by one of Nissan’s suppliers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"What is a transmission that has no gears doing in so many cars, and how does it affect you? ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>Here's What a CVT Is</h3>\r\nIn simplest terms, a CVT, which is coupled to the engine, is a steel or aluminum case enclosing two grooved pulley wheels. Each pulley turns on its own shaft, and a rugged belt runs between them. One pulley receives the engine’s output and distributes it to the second pulley, which sends driving force to the wheels. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Inside the car, the driver selects Drive or Reverse, but otherwise there’s no need for shifting. In a way, having a car with a CVT isn’t so different from walking up the handicapped access ramp instead of climbing the stairs.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"A CVT is compact, lightweight, and inexpensive. Without the teeth of large gears meshing with smaller ones, as in a traditional automatic or manual transmission, the car’s occupants feel no shift shock as it moves along. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>And Here's How It Works</h3>\n“Instead of the engine’s internal operating speed going up and down as you progress through fixed ratios, you vary the transmission ratios,” said Alex Fedorak, spokesman for Mitsubishi, which has CVTs in several vehicles.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"Variability enters the picture when electronic calculations call for hydraulic pressure to be applied to the pulleys, making one wider and the other narrower. How wide or narrow depends on the driver’s input. At low speed, the pulley receiving the engine’s output widens and the other pulley narrows. When the car is barreling down the road, the opposite occurs. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"The belt, which is somewhat V-shaped, climbs or drops between the pulleys’ widened or narrowed sheaves. This creates an effect similar to the different ratios between fixed gears. \r\n \r\nThanks to the CVTs mediation, the engine’s internal operating speed stays more constant. As the result, though, the car tends to moo like an unmilked cow rather than roaring like a bull. Some have also noted an odd floating feeling, as if the engine and wheels aren’t precisely engaged. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<h3>And Here's Why It's a Good Thing</h3>\nBut the advantage of the CVT—why manufacturers are pushing them in the marketplace—is found in superb fuel economy.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2016 Honda Fit","caption":"","fileMasterId":139567796,"fileName":"2016-Honda-Fit.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/139567796/2016-Honda-Fit.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":10,"text":"For example, the 2016 Honda Fit LX with standard 6-speed manual transmission achieves 29 city/37 highway mpg.

It allows the driver to use steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters to manually select and hold simulated, electronically controlled fixed ratios. The feature proved useful when kicking down to a passing gear on the highway. In addition, the test course included a muddy off-road section where churning along in a low gear was desirable.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"A stepped CVT can have other benefits as well. To keep the driver involved and take away the impression of indefiniteness, the Toyota Corolla S has a CVT that includes seven simulated ratios and a sport mode for more aggressive action among them. The Subaru WRX has a CVT with eight steps. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"Fedorak moved to Mitsubishi in 2014, where he renewed his familiarity with CVTs and realized how much progress has been made in delivering performance like that of a conventional automatic transmission. “If you pay close attention to your tachometer, you’ll notice the difference,” he said. “It wasn’t real evident to me right away. That’s how good the programming of them has become.” ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"What about the longevity questions that have sometimes surrounded CVTs? ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":17,"text":"Fedorak says any of today’s CVTs “uses a belt that’s made out of steel links. It’s much, much, much more durable. The belts are nothing to worry about. They’re very sturdy, very massive.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":18,"text":"<h3>So, Should You Get One on Your Next Car?</h3>\nSo if the CVT performs well enough, why even think about it? Because there may be different requirements for service, like having the transmission fluid changed rather frequently. For instance, Nissan Cube owners engage in lively online debates over the question of service intervals, with some advocating fluid changes—which cost around $250—every 30,000 miles.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":19,"text":"Otherwise, as the CVT delivers an improving driving experience and won’t leave you stranded along the road, there’s no reason to think about this transmission any more than the one in your washing machine.

Beyond that, it will provide a satisfyingly engaging experience behind the wheel, the main point of this carbon-fiber-bodied two-seater. A 1.75-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, teamed with a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission with Launch Control and paddle shifters, produces 237 horsepower. What's Launch Control? It's triggered when you press on the brake, fully push down the accelerator, and touch the left steering wheel paddle. Release the brake, and the Launch Control system controls the transmission, power, and traction for maximized acceleration.  Top speed: 160 mph. You can use the Driving Mode selector to choose All Weather, Natural, Dynamic, or Race modes. This is not a car for comfort but one for excitement. The 4C and 4C Launch Edition are coupes, while the Spider has a cloth top; a carbon fiber hard top is coming later in 2016. Personalization choices include track packages, six wheel options, and four choices of brake calipers, as well as extra-cost color options that give you more than one kind of red to choose

There’s also good news for all of the stick-shifting fanatics out there; you can have a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission. The 3 Series is highlighting its sportiness even further in 2016 as the Sport Line now comes standard on the Gran Turismo, 328i, 328d, and 340i (xDrive included). Speaking of standard, rain-sensing wipers, automatic headlights, and BMW Assist eCall all come standard. Unfortunately, you’ll have to pay for features like rearview camera, active blind spot alert, and navigation.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Automatic emergency braking and side collision avoidance technology are standard features, too.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"The Tesla Model X

It was as remarkable a transformation as any Audi he’d ever done, from drab to fab so fast that it became Kia’s first model to reach 150,000 in sales in a year, which was a 480% improvement from 2010 sales.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Kia Optima Sx 27","caption":"","fileMasterId":154698425,"fileName":"kia-optima-sx-27.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/154698425/kia-optima-sx-27.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":2,"text":"As word spread and awards began to roll in (Cars.com’s Best of 2011, finalist for <em>Motor Trend’</em>s Car of the Year, nominated for <em>Car and Driver’</em>s Ten Best, among the most significant), Optima sales blew up, tripling in 2011 and then nearly doubling again in 2012, and holding steady right through this past September.

Sometimes you just have to suffer for your art.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Ford Fiesta St 2016","caption":"","fileMasterId":94073992,"fileName":"ford-fiesta-st-2016.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/94073992/ford-fiesta-st-2016.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":3,"text":"<h3>1. 2016 Ford Fiesta ST</h3>\n<strong>Color name:</strong> Molten Orange<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $22,440 <br>\n<strong>Extra cost for orange?</strong> $595<br>\n<strong>Pumpkin-O-Meter rating:</strong> 7 <br>\n<strong>Comments:</strong> Ford wisely saved this wild orange for the sporty model.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Chevrolet Trax 2016","caption":"","fileMasterId":156780500,"fileName":"chevrolet-trax-2016.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/156780500/chevrolet-trax-2016.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":4,"text":"<h3>2. 2016 Chevrolet Trax LTZ</h3>\n<strong>Color name:</strong> Orange Rock Metallic<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $26,125 <br>\n<strong>Extra cost for orange?</strong> No<br>\n<strong>Pumpkin-O-Meter rating:</strong> 6<br>\n<strong>Comments:</strong> Hot colors look great on little cars.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Fiat 500 2016","caption":"","fileMasterId":94073983,"fileName":"fiat-500-2016.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/94073983/fiat-500-2016.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":5,"text":"<h3>3. 2015 Fiat 500 Sport and 2016 Fiat 500X</h3>\n<strong>Color name:</strong> Rame (500 Sport); Arancio (500X)<br>\n<strong>Base prices:</strong> $18,680 (500 Sport); $20,900 (500X)<br>\n<strong>Extra cost for orange?</strong> No<br>\n<strong>Pumpkin-O-Meter rating:</strong> 6.5 <br>\n<strong>Comments:</strong> If any car should be a crazy color, the Fiat 500 is it.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Hyundai Veloster Turbo 2016","caption":"","fileMasterId":156780506,"fileName":"hyundai-veloster-turbo-2016.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/156780506/hyundai-veloster-turbo-2016.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":6,"text":"<h3>4. 2016 Hyundai Veloster Turbo</h3>\n<strong>Color name:</strong> Vitamin C<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $23,435<br>\n<strong>Extra cost for orange?</strong> No<br>\n<strong>Pumpkin-O-Meter rating:</strong> 7<br>\n<strong>Comments:</strong> A Tang-y orange that shows every carefully carved surface.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Jeep Renegade 02 2016","caption":"","fileMasterId":156780518,"fileName":"jeep-renegade-02-2016.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/156780518/jeep-renegade-02-2016.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":7,"text":"<h3>5. 2016 Jeep Renegade Sport</h3> \n<strong>Color name:</strong> Omaha Orange<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $18,990<br>\n<strong>Extra cost for orange?</strong> No<br>\n<strong>Pumpkin-O-Meter rating:</strong> 3 <br>\n<strong>Comments:</strong> Cool on a '69 Dodge Daytona.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I also think every vehicle with a big hatch should adopt some form of automatic opening, without the need even to press a button, such as Ford’s kick-foot method or Hyundai’s proximity key.

The Touring Elite also gets the HondaVAC, a built-in vacuum that lives in the back of the vehicle behind the third row. \n \nYou could just about buy the base model, the LX ($30,175) and pick up a base Honda Fit on the side ($16,625) for the $45,650 price of the Touring Elite, but the options on the top-end Odyssey are highly desirable. Check out the high-value Special Edition model ($34,275), new for 2016, to get some of those features at a lower price. Case in point? The HondaVAC is on the SE. God, I love that thing. Then again, I am a little OCD about my automotive environment. But people who need that vac will love it, too.

There’s no sense driving a bus if you don’t need one, but the minivan environment is the only perfect conveyance for families with little kids. My husband always had a minivan because he was a tradesman. He, of course, totally trashed the interior with all of his tradesman crap. And dog.  Between the Magic Seats, the third row that folds down, the second row that flips up, you can create a fairly massive deep spot that can hold a lot, including a big cooler. When everything folds down, it’s a flat floor. I can’t overstate the importance to me of the flat load floor, which lets me put a kennel back there.

Chevrolet unveiled a completely redone version of its long-lived Malibu at the New York Auto Show this spring, and it goes on sale by year's end, with a hybrid version coming in the spring.  The all-new Malibu is bigger, sleeker-looking, and loaded with technological choices. The big news is more space inside, with 1.3 more inches of rear legroom and a four-inch improvement in the car's wheelbase. The other big news is a Malibu Hybrid, built on a version of the Chevrolet Volt's powertrain and its regenerative braking system, with a battery pack that can run the Malibu up to 55 mph on electricity alone.  OnStar with a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot is available on all models, and wireless smartphone charging is an option on upper-level models. The strong slate of active safety features includes automatic parking assist, rear cross-traffic alert, and forward collision alert.

The Silverado lineup can satisfy them, no matter what they are, with a regular-cab model with a standard or long truck box; a double-cab model with a short box; or a crew cab with either short or standard box length. You can also get the Silverado with rear- or all-wheel drive and in a choice of seven trim levels. The base WT dresses up with a Black Out Edition this year ($1,595), which should appeal to young entry-level buyers with its 20-inch black-painted wheels, blacked-out grille surround, front bumper and grille, and even black Chevrolet bowtie emblems.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-30T06:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-subaru-forester-promolarge2","title":"2016 Subaru Forester Promolarge2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96094921/2016-subaru-forester-promolarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":96094921,"fileName":"2016-subaru-forester-promolarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-30T06:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-subaru-forester-promolarge2","title":"2016 Subaru Forester Promolarge2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96094921/2016-subaru-forester-promolarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":96094921,"fileName":"2016-subaru-forester-promolarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-30T06:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-subaru-forester-header","title":"2016 Subaru Forester Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96094918/2016-subaru-forester-header.jpg","fileMasterId":96094918,"fileName":"2016-subaru-forester-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":979209,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2016 Subaru Forester 2.5i Premium</h3>\n<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, all-wheel-drive crossover/wagon<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> 2.5i, 2.5i Premium, Limited, Touring; 2.0XT Premium and Touring<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $25,645 (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $28,540<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.5-liter four-cylinder, 170 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Continuously variable automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 24 mpg city/32 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Vehicle-Detail?vehicleId=10182\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 5/5 stars</a>; \nInsurance Institute for Highway Safety: Not yet rated (2015 model was <a href=\"http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/subaru/forester-4-door-suv \" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Top Safety Pick Plus</a>) <br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model: </strong>Rearview camera, panoramic power moonroof, roof rails, 7.0-inch infotainment screen, Bluetooth connectivity<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> All-Weather package (includes heated front seats and side mirrors, windshield wiper de-icer, steering-responsive fog lights, Starlink navigation system, and EyeSight driver assist system ($1,895); continuously variable transmission ($1,000)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering</strong> (all prices include destination charges):<br>\n2016 Ford Escape SE AWD ($27,945)<br>\n2016 Honda CR-V SE AWD ($26,595)<br>\n2016 Hyundai Tucson Sport AWD ($28,445)<br>\n2016 Jeep Cherokee Latitude AWD ($28,190)<br>\n2016 Mazda CX-5 Touring AWD ($27,345)","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter: 6</strong> <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2016 Subaru Forester 5","caption":"","fileMasterId":161138117,"fileName":"2016-subaru-forester-5.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/161138117/2016-subaru-forester-5.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>The compact crossover/sport-utility vehicle category is more crowded than ever,</strong> which means you have more choice than ever.

It includes adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, lane sway warning (when you’re wandering too much within your lane), and pre-collision warning and braking.

The All-Weather part of the equation was extremely handy when a foot of snow fell overnight and the Forester was buried. Turn the key, get the defrosters going, and before you’ve scraped the first side window, those heated side mirrors are radiating the winter right off the side of the vehicle. In its entirety, we’d call that feature bundle a helluva good deal.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"<strong>If what you want is a five-passenger crossover, Subaru has two excellent choices:</strong> this Forester and the more upscale mid-size Outback.

This three-row vehicle doesn’t have a name yet, but Subaru announced earlier this month that it will get a title “synonymous with outdoor adventure.” That’s good, because in Japan the three-row crossover is called the Exiga, which sounds a little too Wall Street for Subaru’s more earthy clientele.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"These cars are bestsellers year in and year out.

Right? It’s time to rethink that, now that winter tires are better than they’ve ever been. All-season tires are great, but, well, to quote the tire experts at mega tire supplier <a href=\"http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/tiretech.jsp?tab=Winter\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tire Rack,</a> they can be jack of all trades, master of none.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"If you want to be at your safest and most confident all year round, your best bet is to alternate all-season tires in the warm months with winter-rated tires from late fall to spring. Even if you aren’t in the Snow Belt, but go skiing on weekends or occasionally encounter snowy conditions, winter tires are a good investment.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Here are five reasons why.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<strong>1. Winter tires remain more pliable in the snow.</strong> All-season tires are stiffer than winter tires. So, as the weather drops below 40 degrees and the roads get more frozen, an all-season tire becomes like hard plastic on the road. Winter tires are made of a softer compound, so they remain pliable at lower temperatures.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<strong>2. Winter tires are built right to push the snow out.</strong> On winter roads, your tires have to cope with a film of water over the road when it’s slushy, wet, or icy. Today’s modern studless ice and snow tires have aggressive tread patterns, with more sipes, or grooves, to take the fluid in and wick it back out. Winter tires have many sipes (deep cuts in the tread) to grab the snow and keep you in control. It’s like black magic.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<strong>3. No technology can improve your grip the way the right tires can.</strong> A front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive vehicle is more stable in the snow and ice. Anti-lock brakes and traction control will improve the car’s handling. But the tires are where grip comes from. Snow tires have more “bite” to grip the way you need them to on snow and ice.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<strong>4. On winter tires, you can stop, accelerate, and turn better.</strong> Stopping, going, and turn distance are all improved in slushy, wet, and icy conditions with winter tires. In a test on ice comparing all-season versus winter cars, Tire Rack found that the winter-tire-clad car stopped 18.5 feet quicker, could corner 3 mph faster without hitting cones on the course, and could accelerate from a stop 25 percent faster than the car with all-season tires. That’s reason enough to consider winter tires this time of year.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<strong>5. It’s not even more expensive in the long run.</strong> Tire Rack says alternating summer and winter tires “means having the best tires to overcome driving challenges all year round, and helps extend the combined years of service drivers get from both sets.” Rather than use a set of all-season tires all year round and replace them sooner, you can alternate winter with all-season tires and get longer life out of both sets. That switchover in spring and fall is totally worth it when you realize you’re driving with more confidence all year round.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":true,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:35:53.952-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456547753953 }} },{ "_id":706848,"title":"Gifts: JBL Trip","subTitle":"THE holiday gift for the person who cares about sound quality and hands-free convenience in the car.","slug":"gifts-jbl-trip","promoTitle":"Gifts: JBL Trip","promoTeaserSmall":"THE holiday gift for the person who cares about sound quality and hands-free convenience in the car.","promoTeaser":"THE holiday gift for the person who cares about sound quality and hands-free convenience in the car.","keywords":["Gifts: JBL Trip"],"metaTitle":"Gifts: JBL Trip - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["JBL Trip","JBL Bluetooth speaker","JBL car speaker","JBL gifts","Christmas gift","Holiday gifts","gift giving","presents","electronics in the car"],"metaDescription":"THE holiday gift for the person who cares about sound quality and hands-free convenience in the car.","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2015-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2015-12-04T07:30:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2015-12-04T07:30:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":false,"url":"/cool-tech/aftermarket-car-parts/gifts-jbl-trip/","canBeGallery":false,"contributors":[{"id":16190,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Molly Jean","firstName":"Molly","lastName":"Jean","jobTitle":"Senior Editor","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"When I turned sixteen, my dad brought home the very first-generation Ford Escort wagon, and it just so happened to have a manual transmission. Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Aftermarket","id":1034783,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/aftermarket-car-parts","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-08T06:53:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"trip-homepage","title":"Trip Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/93885363/trip-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":93885363,"fileName":"trip-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-08T06:53:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"trip-homepage","title":"Trip Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/93885363/trip-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":93885363,"fileName":"trip-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-07T13:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"trip-header","title":"Trip Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96758065/trip-header.jpg","fileMasterId":96758065,"fileName":"trip-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":979940,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"If Santa is not flush enough to deliver a brand-new car to you this year, you can hope for the <a href=\"http://www.jbl.com/ifa-products/JBLTRIP.html\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">JBL Trip</a>.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034953,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/car-on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-19T12:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"civic-promo","title":"Civic Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98625811/civic-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":98625811,"fileName":"civic-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-19T12:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"civic-promo","title":"Civic Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98625811/civic-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":98625811,"fileName":"civic-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-19T12:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"civic-header","title":"Civic Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98625808/civic-header.jpg","fileMasterId":98625808,"fileName":"civic-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":982432,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Welcome to Five Cool Things from <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">JeanKnowsCars.com</a>!</strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3mg9CQULbew?autoplay=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Welcome to the 2016 Honda Civic.

BMW Re-Envisions the Rearview Mirror and Gives Your Hands New Power.</strong><br>\nThis whole camera thing is reaching its logical conclusion now, as the BMW i8 is appearing at CES without any mirrors, only cameras. No more blind spots! Plus, the system will warn you if the cameras spot an approaching danger. Images from three cameras are combined on a display where you'd expect a rearview mirror to be. Meanwhile, the smaller i3 gets a slightly more conventional setup that adds images from a roof-mounted camera to the rearview mirror.<br>\n<br>\nStill more intriguing is Air Touch, which will let you wave your hands meaningfully to make things happen—meaning you can use the features of your touchscreen without actually reaching over and touching anything. This is an expansion on the Gesture Control already available on the BMW 7 Series.<br>\n<br><br>\nAt CES, BMW showed AirTouch on a good-looking concept, the i Vision Future Interaction, with a high-resolution twenty-one-inch panoramic display that recognizes movement.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-02-02T10:15:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-hyundai-elantra-homepage","title":"2017 Hyundai Elantra Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/99347533/2017-hyundai-elantra-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":99347533,"fileName":"2017-hyundai-elantra-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-02-02T10:15:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-hyundai-elantra-homepage","title":"2017 Hyundai Elantra Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/99347533/2017-hyundai-elantra-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":99347533,"fileName":"2017-hyundai-elantra-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-02-02T10:15:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-hyundai-elantra-header","title":"2017 Hyundai Elantra Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/170030450/2017-hyundai-elantra-header.jpg","fileMasterId":170030450,"fileName":"2017-hyundai-elantra-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":987172,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, front-wheel-drive compact sedan<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> SE, Limited; Eco (coming spring 2016)<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $17,150  (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $27,710<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.0-liter four-cylinder, 147 horsepower; 1.4-liter four-cylinder, 128 horsepower (Eco)<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed automatic (SE, Limited) or six-speed manual (SE); seven-speed dual-clutch automatic (Eco)<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 29 mpg city/38 mpg highway (2.0-liter engine)<br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: Not yet rated; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: Not yet rated<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features:</strong> Drive Mode Select with Eco, Normal, and Sport modes<br>\n<strong>Options I can’t live without:</strong> Power tilting and sliding sunroof, heated rear seats, HID headlights with dynamic bending<br>\n<strong>Competition</strong> (all prices include destination charges):<br>\n2016 Ford Focus Titanium ($24,100)<br>\n2016 Honda Civic EX-L with Honda Sensing ($25,535)<br>\n2016 Mazda 3 s Grand Touring ($26,615)<br>\n2016 Toyota Corolla S Premium ($23,960)<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7.5<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>If you are shopping for a compact car these days, your expectations have probably changed since the first Hyundai Elantra arrived in 1990.</strong> Dave Zuchowski, president and chief executive officer of Hyundai Motor America, explained it like this.

It’s a tad longer than the last Elantra, but it’s the extra inch of width that makes the visual statement. A slick-looking vertical strip of LED daytime running lights flank an inlet on each side of the classic Hyundai grille. The inlets are an aerodynamic aid that take air hitting the front and send it smoothly out through the front wheel arches. Hyundai calls the feature a Wheel Air Curtain.

(The 2016 Limited with the 2.0-liter four-cylinder got 24 mpg city and 35 mpg highway.) The Eco model, due this spring, will have a turbocharged 128-horsepower 1.4-liter engine exclusively, with a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. I didn’t have a chance to drive that car, but just looking at the level of torque produced—the measure of how forcefully it pushes you down the road—it’s impressive at 156 pound-feet, compared with 132 pound-feet on the 2.0-liter engine.

The 2017 Elantra jumps from last model’s 2 percent high-strength steel to 53 percent, and you can feel it. Hyundai, like other manufacturers, has also massively increased the use of structural adhesive, from a nominal 10 feet to 394 feet. It’s a huge deal. By replacing welds and rivets, the car becomes quieter and also lighter. The extensive use of the super-strength adhesive also allows thinner metal without sacrificing strength. If you’re worried that Super Glue doesn’t always work for you at home, keep in mind that structural adhesive works very well for rockets in space.
