The proof comes from Ford’s all-new C-Max Hybrid and Energi. The compact car is cute in the current Ford style, with wedgy shaping and a toothy grille, but its main selling point is fuel economy. It is rated at 47 mpg both in town and on the highway—which Ford hastens to point out is 7 mpg better than the Toyota Prius v’s highway numbers. The C-Max has a lithium-ion battery that recharges when the gasoline engine is in use; plus, there’s regenerative braking—recycling at its least onerous—which recaptures up to 95 percent of the energy used in braking and uses it to recharge the battery. The C-Max is not only efficient; it also responds to the eco-conscious aesthetic by using a greenery theme in its Smartgauge display, which displays more leaves and vines as a “visual reward” when a driver is more efficient in his or her driving habits. The C-Max’s popular price, starting just over $25,000—lower than its closest rival, the Toyota Prius, and some $10,000 cheaper than the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf—will help it win fans, as will its uncontroversial styling. The fact that you can drive the plug-in Energi at speeds up to 85 mph on electrical power alone should electrify the highway commuter crowd. But the number-one drawing card will be its efficiency in a time of insecure gasoline prices.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Competitors:\n1.\tToyota Prius v\n2.\tToyota Prius III\n\n\nCool Tech items\n1.

","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"There are more than 100 models of car seats on the market, and they more or less all do the same thing. Pre-pregnancy, I probably would have just eyeballed a product and picked the model with the best balance of attractive packaging and price. However, something about expecting a child for the first time makes even so-called experts second-guess their instincts and decision-making skills and question every purchase.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Adding to the pressure was the assurance from another expectant mom in my childbirth class that this was one of the most important decisions I would be making for my child. The message is clear: choose the wrong car seat, and my baby could die.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"Google, which theoretically should make researching easier, actually makes things worse. Search strings became my new forte, and they give me powerful new analytical skills, which I seem to use only when it comes to selecting baby gear. Complicated Excel spreadsheets with charts and rating systems were drafted. Anonymous questions were posted on BabyCenter.com, and e-mails were sent to product manufacturers. Perhaps too much weight and deference was given to reviewers with eyebrow-raising names like \"Ms_MeowMeow.\"","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Despite coming into the process with a better-than-average understanding of where to look for information, online shopping was a failure. I couldn't manage the dozen or so windows crowding my tiny laptop screen while cross-checking model numbers with \"professional\" reviews from bloggers and parenting sites, and then verifying with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration if it had been recalled or not. With my due date fast approaching, I shut my computer and headed over to the local baby mart.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"But it didn’t get any easier. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"I was confronted with a wall of choices. Each bulbous seat was clothed in epileptic-fit-inducing hot pink and giraffe-printed fabrics, each competing to out-bulk, out-plasticize, and out-bling the next. The minimalist in me (read: cheapskate) flirted with the idea of getting an all-in-one car seat that would take my soon-to-be-born daughter from birth to toddlerhood. But that idea was nixed by the salesperson, who swore I wouldn’t want to wake a napping baby to move her from the stroller to the car seat every time.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"\"Go with the infant seat,\" she insisted.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"That meant choosing a base with a car seat that could be detached and carried by its handle into the house or attached to a stroller.

But which do you pick first? The car seat or the stroller? ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"Luckily, fate decided for me. I jumped on a promotion that offered a free car seat with a purchase of a Britax B-Ready stroller, which I was already eyeing. There were two Britax car seats available, but the Chaperone was the bigger, more expensive option touting something called \"recoil protection.\" I didn’t know what that was, but I was positive my newborn would need it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"Online reviews mentioned that the Chaperone was significantly longer than the B-Safe, which made me hesitate on the \"add to cart\" button.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"\"Get the bigger one,\" insisted my husband, clearly looking just to maximize the benefit of the free promotion.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"But bigger wasn’t better when it came to trying to fit it into our 2008 Subaru Outback. As the online reviewer warned, it didn’t fit our mid-size car. The only way it would sit on the bench is if both front seats were adjusted all the way forward, which would definitely be safe for our child because we wouldn’t be able to fit in the car or drive anywhere.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"Back the Chaperone went to Amazon, with return shipping fees eating into our promotional savings. A few days later, the smaller, cheaper B-Safe arrived. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"And the second one didn’t seem to fit, either. While technically we could  squeeze it in the middle seat of the second row, we struggled to get the seatbelt tight enough. Tension seemed to come solely from the front driver and passenger seats pressing tight against the car seat, pinning it in place. Was this normal? Were we doing this right?\n \nHaving bought a B-Ready stroller, I was more or less stuck with this car seat, since Britax strollers only accommodate Britax car seats. So rather than turn to Google, I dialed up the local Car Seat Lady for validation.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"Sue Emery is a certified child passenger safety technician, who has spent the past twenty years teaching parents in the Seattle area how to buy and properly install car seats in their vehicles.

","type":"paragraph"},{"order":19,"text":"She continued, \"Even if the car seat technically fits the car, it may not fit it with the driver and front passenger in it.\"","type":"paragraph"},{"order":20,"text":"Since car seats are regulated and car companies independently crash test their car seats, a parent should feel confident that it will protect her child in a crash – as long as it’s installed correctly. But nine times out of ten, it’s not. This means parents should be shopping for car seat by size and fit, not by price, color, or stroller compatibility, as I did.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":21,"text":"Apparently, the time to consult the car seat lady is before you make your purchase. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":22,"text":"Within twenty minutes of her free consultation in the parking lot at my apartment, she taught me how to adjust the base so it fit on the bench seat and install the car seat with room for my husband and me to still fit comfortably in the front row. And I only broke two nails in the process.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":23,"text":"Just as important were her recommendations for convertible seats that would fit my car when my daughter outgrew her infant carrier seat, which will cut my shopping time down to nothing.

The RL is clearly the more sedate of the two and draws in older buyers with its cushy interior. More spacious than any other Acura sedan, the RL has room for passengers to stretch out. It benefits from a sleek looking dash and information display, although the navigation system itself could use an update. Smooth leather seats come standard, as do keyless entry and a USB port and auxiliary jack for MP3 players. Change is in the air for the RL, however. After a long history as Acura’s respectable, refined sedan, the RL will become the 2014 RLX, for sale in early 2013. The new model will be bigger and heavier, and will come in a “sport hybrid” model, which Acura expects to achieve 30 mpg – a huge improvement over the current model’s 24 mpg on the highway. The RL provides more than enough comfort and drivability for its nearly $50,000 price point, but it could use a touch more excitement, which is probably exactly what the RLX will have in store.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 4","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

As the Toyota brand’s flagship, the Avalon has enjoyed popularity among the retiree set as well as among satisfied Camry customers who simply want a little bit more, in the form of an extra-wide cabin, a Costco-grade trunk, a high level of creature comforts, and a schmaltzy ride. But the all-new 2013 Avalon has evolved into something more than a Camry. It has become lighter in weight and shorter in both height and length, making it one of the more garage-friendly full-size sedans around. Just as significant, the Avalon has upgraded almost everything under the skin, and now it shares pretty much all of its innards with none other than the slick new 2013 Lexus ES. Like the Lexus, the Avalon is powered by a silken, powerful 3.5-liter V-6 with 268 horsepower in standard form, or a four-cylinder/electric powertrain combo in the new-for-2013 Avalon hybrid that scores an EPA rating of 40 mpg. The 2013 Avalon was designed in California and brandishes a glitzy new grille, LED running lamps, sweeping body sides, and an elegantly arching roof. But the Avalon’s new interior may be its best attribute, offering not just tons of space but far more luxury experience than ever, thanks to additional sound-deadening materials, hand-stitched dash covers, capacitive touch controls, and lots of fancy options including heated front and rear seats and soft ambient lighting.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Still looking fresh after its complete redesign for the 2012 model year, Toyota’s perennial bestseller is unchanged for 2013, and that’s generally fine by us, as Toyota did a remarkable job adding emotion to the Camry this time around (not too much, of course…2012 is an election year, after all). Not only does its styling actually convey, well, actual style from its broad, beveled mug to its chunky, L-shaped taillamps, but it drives pretty well, too, with taut suspensions and communicative steering. Three engine choices await customers, including a frugal 178-horsepower four-cylinder, a velvety 268-horsepower V-6, and a four-cylinder/electric hybrid, the latter helping the Camry hybrid achieve an impressive 41-mpg rating from the EPA. The interior still suffers from some corporate boardroom austerity, but it is comfortably equipped even in base form and feels Lexus-like in uplevel XLE form. And of course, since it’s a Toyota, assembly quality is pretty spectacular. As good as it is, however, the Camry will have a tougher time than ever keeping its sales crown this year, with stiff new competition coming from the Ford Fusion, the Chevrolet Malibu, the Nissan Altima, and the Camry’s arch-nemesis, the Honda Accord, each of which should also be checked out by mid-size sedan shoppers before plunking down their money for a Camry.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Huge, clean, and full of storage cubbies and sliding things, the Sienna could double as a hospital if it only came with a gurney. But there’s more to the Sienna than just seats and space. Five trim levels are available, ranging from basic to truly luxurious, with a surprisingly decent-looking SE model adding a touch of sportiness to the lineup. As with most of its competitors, the Sienna can host up to eight at a time, with seats that can be inclined, reclined, slid, stowed, and flattened in countless combinations. One particularly cool feature is the 16.4-inch-wide, remote-controlled rear entertainment screen that can play two different videos side by side. Another is the nifty front center console that can be slid rearward so second-row occupants can reach it. The sole powerplant is Toyota’s smooth and quiet 266-horsepower V-6, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission, which helps it achieve a respectable 18/25 mpg city/highway fuel economy rating from the EPA. The Honda Odyssey may be better-looking and the Chrysler Town & Country more fun to drive, but neither will have an easy time keeping up with the Sienna on a snowy road, as the Sienna is the industry’s first minivan to offer all-wheel drive (although choosing one so equipped drops fuel economy by two miles per gallon). If there’s a bone to pick with the Sienna, it’s that it is simply not very emotional. But then again, what hospital is?","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 3","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Thank Toyota’s steady-handed stewardship of its signature truck for its intensely loyal following that has kept the model selling in droves even as competitors have come and gone. In 2013, the Tacoma’s sole direct competitor is the comparatively gruff Nissan Frontier, and with its winning combination of slick looks, sterling build quality, bountiful comfort levels, and cab styles (including a simple standard cab model), the Tacoma is arguably the superior of the two. The Tacoma looks particularly good as the low-riding XRunner and the high-riding PreRunner, the latter even more so when you splurge on the T|X and T|X Pro packages. Anyone fancying a bit more cush should like the new Limited grade, with its chrome exterior trim, metallic dash surfaces, heated front seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and more. As before, a 159-horsepower four-cylinder is the base engine, while the bulk of models and all 4x4s come standard with a 236-horsepower V-6. We recommend the V-6 if you ever plan to get out of your own way, let alone carry a load in the bed.

It seats four, just like a Porsche Panamera, but you won’t feel anything is wasted. The C30 is available in T5 and T5 R-Design versions, each with Premier, Premier Plus, and Platinum trim levels. The Platinum includes power-operated front seats and sunroof, keyless start, active Xenon headlamps, navigation, and a killer sound system. The C30 Polestar Limited Edition makes its debut in October, but only 250 examples--all in the same hue of Rebel Blue--will reach American showrooms. Polestar is Volvo’s performance subbrand, similar to M at BMW and AMG at Mercedes-Benz; revisions to the engine result in 250 horsepower, and the car rides on unique matte black seventeen-inch wheels. Premier Plus trim is standard for the Polestar, with Platinum optional.

The company now applies the word “exclusive” to the car, although this is because it doesn’t sell very well. The only good explanation for the slow sales, though, is that snob appeal is lacking. This handsome, if understated, sedan is smooth on the road and well equipped. It offers a good value equation. You’ll find such unexpected standard features as Volvo’s City Safety system for avoiding low-speed collisions and the available blind spot monitoring and pedestrian detection. The cabin, richly appointed with leather and walnut, can be overpopulated with twelve speakers for a wonderful music environment. Americans choose from two models. The 3.2 is powered by a 240-horsepower 3.2-liter six-cylinder engine. A smaller, turbocharged 3.0-liter six makes 300 horsepower to move the T6 AWD smartly down the road. The two models share the same six-speed automatic. The S80 is Volvo’s technology leader: it introduced keyless start and Personal Car Communicator, a key fob that foretells unlocked doors and vehicle intrusion, and this is now standard. A smartphone app is also available for staying connected with the S80.

Nevertheless, a market niche remains, and the XC70 continues to occupy it. Two versions are available: the 3.2 and the T6 AWD. The former’s 3.2-liter six-cylinder makes 240 horsepower, while the latter’s turbocharged 3.0-liter six makes 300 horsepower. A six-speed automatic is included with either model. Beyond the base 3.2 are Premier, Premier Plus, and Platinum trim levels, while the T6 AWD also comes in Premier Plus and Platinum trim. The T6 AWD comes with a remote garage door opener, keyless start with a key fob that plays detective before you open the door, active Xenon headlamps that look around the corners for you, a power moonroof and tailgate, and other amenities. Heated front and rear seats available with climate package and heated washer fluid nozzles help make the XC70 one of the most serious winter cars in the marketplace.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

What other car, besides its corporate cousin the Chrysler 300, can be the perfect family car by day and star in rap videos by night? With rear-wheel drive or on-demand all-wheel drive, the Charger has also become the darling of law enforcement, if that means anything to you (just don’t expect it to get you out of any speeding tickets, trust us). Still, there are many reasons it can wear so many hats. First, it looks great, with a menacing stare and many Mopar accessories available to help you customize it to your liking (the Blacktop package is particularly hot, we think). It also has some chops, with a base V-6 making 292 horsepower, mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission that helps the big girl achieve 31 mpg on the highway. Spring for the 370-horsepower V-8 and it becomes downright fast, and for speed demons, a scary-looking 470-horsepower SRT-8 model is pure hooligan heaven. Finally, the Charger has a value story to tell, with base models starting under $26,000 (less than a V-6-equipped Toyota Camry), and dashboard trim rendered in real aluminum. Optional are sport seats, a simple Garmin-based navigation/infotainment system using a huge 8.4-inch screen, and even a Beats by Dr. Dre sound system. A full-size sedan with full-size character, the Dodge Charger is as American as a car gets.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

It offers beefy, all-weather performance, good towing capabilities and a rugged, utilitarian interior. The muscular Armada can tow up to 9,000 pounds and tackle the outdoors, thanks to its truck chassis and low-range four-wheel drive that can handle extreme towing or off-roading needs. A third-row seat is standard and eight passengers can ride comfortably in the spacious Armada. Its standard engine, a 5.6-liter V-8, is rated at 317 horsepower. The engine is linked to a five-speed automatic transmission. But the Armada is thirsty, delivering 12 mpg in city driving and 19 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The Armada, which has a heavy-duty, fully boxed ladder frame, drives like a truck and can be a beast to maneuver into tight parking spaces. Although the interior on the base model feels somewhat cheap, Nissan continues to offer packages that dress up the cabin. For 2013, a new Platinum Reserve package debuts, adding twenty-inch dark chrome wheels, dark chrome grille, and outside mirrors, along with a two-tone Chocolate/Almond leather-trimmed seating with dark satin chrome interior accents.

Audi’s trademark grille and headlight styling are prominent in the Allroad, and the interior is much more spacious than Audi’s sedans. New seating allows more headroom for passengers, and there is plenty of storage space for bags or gear.  Audi’s new Connect technology can make use of Google Earth connectivity and turn the car into a roving hotspot. There is an available Bang & Olufsen sound system, though it is almost prohibitively expensive and requires an upgrade to the Prestige trim level.

With three spacious rows of seats, it can fit up to seven people; with all the seats down, it can fit pretty much anything you can think of. Audi axed a V-8 engine in 2012, and this year they have gone even further toward improving fuel efficiency by offering a new, lighter V-6 diesel engine that is twelve percent more fuel-efficient than previous diesel models, earning an impressive 28 mpg on the highway. The Q7 hasn’t received a major redesign in some years, and its age is showing, but with an updated grille and headlights on the 2013 model, some of that will be mitigated. The design of the interior will remain much the same, but available technology packages could turn the Q7 into your home away from home. The premium packages are rather expensive, but if you’ve got the money, you’re not likely to regret it.

But the EPA rates the Leaf’s driving range at 73 miles per charge – which makes the little EV impractical for anyone with a long commute. The federal government says there are only 4,466 public charging stations in the U.S., a statistic that may increase “range anxiety” for anyone who owns or is thinking about buying an electric car. Still, the Leaf has a lot going for it. The price is good for an electric car and the Leaf is eligible for federal and state incentives that can help to defray the cost. It drives like a “real” car with sprightly acceleration, zero tailpipe emissions, and a 90-mph top speed. The EPA rates the Leaf at the miles-per-gallon equivalent of 106 in the city and 92 on the highway – the second most fuel-efficient car in America after the Mitsubishi i. The downside is that Leaf home charging can take up to twenty hours without an optional quick charging station. The range can also vary depending on the weather and how much cargo you are carrying. The Leaf suffers from tight rear seats, small cargo space for a hatchback, and confusing cabin technology. But if you have short commutes, have no fear of running out of juice, and want to boost your green credentials, the Leaf may be the way to go.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The one downside is that the Murano tends to be a bit expensive. What you get for the money is a pleasing exterior design that remains unchanged for the new model year. A wide chrome-and-mesh grille and triangular headlights prove to be a dramatic combination in the front, while a roof spoiler adds interest in the rear. Nissan beefed up the Murano for 2013 with advanced safety technologies added to the uplevel LE Platinum Edition and SL Navigation Package. The Murano again offers a standard 260-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 linked to an Xtronic CVT. The combination offers smooth, powerful acceleration and returns 18 mpg in city driving and 24 mpg on the highway on the Murano front-wheel-drive model and 18 mpg in city driving and 23 mpg on the highway on the four-wheel-drive model. The ride is comfortable and relatively soft. A long list of options includes a dual panel power moonroof, eight-way power driver’s seat with power lumbar support, and SiriusXM satellite radio. The Murano is an excellent choice for small families who don’t want to sacrifice sensibility for style. You get both with this Japanese crossover.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Here there are plenty of options in a neat laundry list including possible fabric and color combinations.  The Bentley GT is big and powerful, but surprisingly easy to drive, which sets it apart from other fussy, super-luxury cars with extra-sensitive gas pedals. The two-door Bentley was refreshed in 2011 followed by the 2012 convertible GTC. Bentley has broadened its engine portfolio, starting with its badass W-12 and now introducing the less thirsty and much thriftier V-8, which manages to pack a wallop of power. Next comes the GT Speed coming in September 2012 that, rumor has it, will be the fastest Bentley ever.

Remarkably for this class and price range, the 528i goes about its business with a turbo four-cylinder. Then there’s the ActiveHybrid 5, in which the turbo six is assisted by an electric motor, their output going through an eight-speed transmission. As quick as it can be, the ActiveHybrid 5 can also creep along solely on battery power for 2.5 miles. Ask your neighbor if his Blutomobile can do that! Efficiency is spreading across the 5-series range, too, thanks to the automatic stop/start, which completely shuts off the engine while you sit at intersections, then restarts it when you release the brake.

Yeah, it’s not often that the words “minivan” and “fun to drive” are used in the same sentence, but in this case—and that of the GC’s Chrysler-branded twin, the Town & Country—it’s the surprising reality. Credit thorough re-engineering for 2011 that banished the sloppy handling and gooey steering usually associated with such domesticated vehicles. Less surprising is the way it accommodates families with up to seven members and all of their attendant accoutrements. In addition to the abundant space, kid stuff—and the second- or third-row seats themselves—may be stowed (with one-handed operation) in deep reservoirs in the floor of most models. The GC comes in five flavors: AVP, SE, SXT, Crew, and R/T, the first two priced very aggressively (the AVP starts under $21,000), and the latter three featuring the highest amount of popular equipment. Our favorite is the R/T model (which Dodge has lightheartedly referred to as the “man van,” with its monochromatic paint, a tighter suspension, seventeen-inch satin carbon wheels, black leather upholstery, red stitching, and a whomping sound system. All Grand Caravans are powered by the same meaty 283-horsepower V-6 mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Compared with the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna, the Grand Caravan may be a tad smaller, but it is tons more fun.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

It’s set up for performance with Brembo brakes, an airflow-improving grille, performance tires, a set of center-mounted, mouthy tailpipes, and, last but not least, a supercharged V-8 engine that puts out 556 horsepower—and helps limit fuel economy to a maximum of 19 mpg on the highway.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7 to 9","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

For 2013, changes to the SRX are evolutionary. The front upper and lower grilles have been updated, and the interior gets upgraded technology. Among the safety improvements is the interesting Safety Alert Seat, which vibrates one of the driver’s seat bolsters when there’s a perceived danger such as too close proximity to an object such as a tree or another vehicle.  There’s also adaptive cruise control and automatic braking, both of which rely on radar and sensors to the extent of actually putting on the brake for you if danger is imminent. The SRX also has Cadillac’s new Cue information and entertainment system, which triggered a redesign of the intstrument cluster and center stack, plus such luxury amenities as a rearview camera, heated front seats, a leather-trimmed steering wheel—you can get it heated as well—and a power sunroof. Performance and Premium versions get some new twenty-inch wheel designs. You can dress up the SRX’s interior with an all-black look to go with the French stitching and polished chrome, and there’s even sapele wood trim as an option.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7.5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The plug-in hybrid Karma is the only Fisker model currently on sale, and with a price hovering around $100,000 it is no impulse buy. The Karma aims to illustrate that environmentally friendly doesn’t mean boring, and in that right they have certainly succeeded. The Karma’s batteries have a range of about fifty miles, after which a gas engine takes over until batteries are recharged. At times, for instance during fast acceleration, the Karma operates using both battery and gas engine power.  For even more eco-friendliness, the Karma has a solar panel roof that increases the electric range by about four to five miles per week. Those extra miles won’t get you far, but it still adds a certain car-of-the-future feel to Fisker’s first offering. When it’s running on electric, the Karma gets an impressive 54 miles to the gallon equivalent. On the gas motor, however, it earns an entirely unimpressive 20-mpg combined. This relatively low number belies the Karma’s true spirit – that of a luxury sports car. With an attractive interior, unforgettable design, and innovative technology, the Karma can’t fail to make a statement.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 9","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

But fuel economy is not the main reason for the F-Series; utility is. Besides, every F-Series truck in the Ford lineup has a six-speed automatic transmission, a fuel saver. Ten kinds of F-150s are available, from the workaday XL to the edgy SVT Raptor to the ultra-gussied-up Harley-Davidson F-150 edition. The Raptor is a “performance truck” with a massive 411 horsepower and off-roading amenities including beadlock-capable wheels to keep the tires in place and heavy-duty skid plates to protect the chassis during heavy-duty driving. Seating inside the F-150s runs the gamut from basic on the XL to snakeskin-accented black leather on the Harley-Davidson edition. SuperCab and SuperCrew versions can bring the total passenger volume to six, while the standard F-150 seats three. Among the amenities are power telescoping and power folding trailer-tow side-view mirrors and a set of high-intensity discharge headlamps. An interesting touch is that climate and audio controls are “optimized” for use by those who may be encumbered by wearing heavy work gloves. The F-150 continues to sell so well because it continues to offer utility and practicality in a user-friendly package.

The seven-speed transmission, which sits on the rear axle, is recalibrated for faster shifting when the manual mode and aluminum paddle shifters are used. The Adaptive Performance Suspension that features variable, electronically-tuned shock absorbers, now is tuned for stiffer springs and shocks, resulting in a more dynamic feel. To mark the new model, which finds “GT” added to the name, the exterior is festooned anew. Special badges denote the GT, and headlight covers and tail light treatments are darker. The brake calipers now wear a fashionable coat of red. And a high-gloss black finish is added to the front grille trim, side mirrors, and the various fins found on the hood and fenders. Inside the car, red seatbelts provide a sporty contrast with newly added black trim on center console and door panels.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 10","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Insight shares its hybrid technology with the ever-popular Civic Hybrid, and gets similar gas mileage with 41 mpg in the city and 44 mpg on the highway. The Insight melds the interior of several other Honda sedans, creating an appealing Frankenstein’s monster of ergonomic controls.  The interior also offers plenty of hiding spots and storage space for whatever you carry around. Perhaps the Insight’s biggest draw is its price, with a base price below $20,000. The low price isn’t without drawbacks, however, and the Insight can be rough on bumpy roads and loud at high speeds.  Honda didn’t skimp on safety, though, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the Insight as a Top Safety Pick. With rear seats down the cargo space – already respectable for a small car – almost doubles. The Insight’s charms and price are enough to make up for some minor deficiencies, and it is a good choice if you’re looking for a hybrid that doesn't break the bank.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Elantra GT offers a sportier ride than the sedan version, along with a roomy cabin. The base Elantra sedan takes a lot of anxiety away at the gas pump, since it returns 40 mpg on the highway. The Elantra GT falls just short of that, delivering 39 mpg on the highway. Standard features on the 2013 Elantra GT include a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 148 horsepower, heated front seats, seventeen-inch alloy wheels, and seven airbags. The Elantra GT starts at $19,170, including a $775 destination charge. A GT Style package for both versions of the Elantra GT is priced at $2,750 and adds such items as seventeen-inch alloy wheels, sport-tuned suspension, panoramic sunroof, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and aluminum pedals. A GT Technology package for both versions of the Elantra GT is priced at $2,350 and adds a navigation system, rearview camera, automatic headlights, and dual automatic temperature control. This option requires the Style package, noted Hyundai.

In 2012, improvements to the interior finally made the Patriot competitive in its class, and it even boasts Jeep’s Trail Rated badge. (Don’t take it on the Rubicon, though; the Patriot is still no Wrangler.) The upside of some lackluster components is that the Patriot is by far Jeep’s cheapest option; with a base price of $15,995 it is kind to even the sparsest pocketbooks. The upgraded interior includes deluxe cloth seats, a sound system with MP3 support and an audio jack, and optional Uconnect that can act as a mobile WiFi hotspot for up to eight devices. Like the Compass and the Liberty, the Patriot will be replaced by a new Fiat-based model by 2013 or 2014, so if this budget Jeep is your dream car you may as well get it while the getting is good.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong> <br />\n1.

The Evora lives up to its racecar pedigree with good starting and stopping power. The interior is sparse but not unattractive, with available contrast stitching and front racing seats. Options include a touchscreen navigation system, a backup camera, and iPod and MP3 connectivity. The area behind the front row can be configured to hold two seats, but the Evora still wouldn’t quite count as a four-seater, earning a 2+2 designation instead. Don’t let that deter you if you’ve got a young family, though. The available back seat comes equipped to handle child seats. If you’re not enticed by a tight squeeze in the back seat, that area can turn into a low bench instead, perfect for hauling shopping bags (though maybe not groceries for five). It gets good gas mileage for a sports car, making almost 30 mpg on the highway, but even the base model is more expensive than most competitors.

In addition to this, both the Extended and Crew Cab body styles have flip-up rear seats, fold-down passenger seats, and storage boxes for moving smaller things that either can’t or shouldn’t be hitched to the back of a truck. Suzuki believes in providing its customers with options, so in addition to your choice of cab body styles, you also have the choice of a long or short bed for your Equator, as well as a five-speed manual or automatic transmission. However, keep in mind, stick-shift aficionados, that the manual is only available with the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. The automatic only comes with the V-6.

The Outback also makes certain that all your trips to campus are safe ones thanks to Subaru’s new EyeSight system, which will activate the breaks before a collision and a stereo camera that will let you see the obstacles in your path before you feel them.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors: </strong><br />\n1.\tFord Escape<br />\n2.\tGMC Terrain<br />\n3.\tJeep Liberty<br />\n4.\tToyota Highlander","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items:</strong><br />\n1.\tEyeSight driver assist system.<br />\n2.\tHarman/Kardon audio system (on the Premium model).","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks: </strong><br />\n1.\tGround clearance of 8.7 inches. <br />\n2.\tRedesigned grille, headlights, and bumper cover.<br/>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585478,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585478/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":33,"text":"<strong>New for 2013:</strong><br />\n1.\tNew engine with more power.<br />\n2.\tBluetooth steering wheel control switches.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"Wagons","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20437,"make":"Subaru","model":"Outback","year":2013},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":9},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:09:48.057-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546188058 }} },{ "_id":222680,"title":"2013 Mercedes-Benz E-Class","subTitle":"If you can’t find the right shape or features and then have fun with it, your meds aren’t working","slug":"2013-mercedes-benz-e-class","promoTitle":"2013 Mercedes-Benz E-Class","promoTeaserSmall":"2013 Mercedes-Benz E-Class","promoTeaser":"2013 Mercedes-Benz E-Class","keywords":["2013 Mercedes-Benz E-Class"],"metaTitle":"2013 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Buyer's Guide - Jean Knows Cars","metaKeywords":["2013","mercedes-benz","e class","buyers guide"],"metaDescription":"2013 Mercedes-Benz E-Class Buyer's Guide","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2012-09-28T17:24:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2012-09-28T17:24:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"buyer_guide","webExclusive":false,"url":"/new-cars/mercedes-benz/2013-mercedes-benz-e-class/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[],"categories":[{"alias":"Mercedes-Benz","id":1025685,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/new-cars/mercedes-benz","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"new-cars","id":1024395,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/new-cars","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{},"pages":[{"id":239407,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"There’s always the secure feeling that comes from being in a well-built car.

The optional On- and Off-Road Package offers a two-speed transfer case, locking center differential for crawling ability, and six transmission settings, all of which will significantly reduce the difficulty of your trek to drop off kids at the junior high school. (Maybe this redundant capability explains why a simple rear-wheel-drive version of the ML350 is now offered.) Mercedes piles on the standard features with the latest “mbrace” telematics system to link with your smartphone, an anti-collision system, and a colorful new instrument panel. In case you don’t want to wait until you reach the resort to get a massage, the optional contoured seats will give you one. (If it’s a hot-stone treatment, though, see your dealer.)

Both are tiny city cars with high gas mileage and relatively few practical uses outside the urban center. The iQ has improved upon some of Smart’s drawbacks, however, and has the dubious honor of being the smallest four-passenger car for sale in the United States. The iQ is often marketed as a 3+1 car instead of a four-seater, because the front driver’s seat is positioned further back than the passenger seat, eating up much of the rear legroom on that side. The Scion earns essentially the same gas mileage as the Smart, with 36 mpg in the city and 37 on the highway, but where it really shows its advantage is in the ride. Despite its short wheelbase, the iQ doesn’t jostle you over every bump in the road. It is also extremely maneuverable, with a turning radius almost three feet shorter than the Smart’s. If you’re looking for an ultracompact car with a little more legroom, the Fiat 500 is a safer bet, but the iQ has the rest of the bases covered.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

The 2012 model reaches up to 35 miles to the gallon on the highway, but the Countryman still offers the performance you expect from a Mini, and has the distinction of being the only car in Mini’s lineup to come with available four-wheel drive.

It has an aggressive forward stance and quasi-retro styling, and while the interior styling could be a little sleeker, it is undeniably fun. A center rail that runs the length of the car has colored ambient lighting and sliding rear cup holders.

The CX-9 has big shoes to fill in the Mazda lineup, especially since it’s the end of the road for the Mazda CX-7, which slotted in below the CX-9. The CX-7 is being discontinued in the U.S. Pricing has yet to be announced for the redone CX-9, but it should start at around $30,000. The CX-9 has always won compliments for its communicative steering, car-like responses, and highway stability, along with good interior quality. The third row may be best left for kids, but the CX-9 is set to remain a more stylish alternative to traditional vans and boxier SUVs.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The 2013 MKS is a redesigned model that holds on to the smooth, refined ride a Lincoln buyer is looking for while adding lots of high-tech features. Chief among those is Lincoln Drive Control, a system that will let you change almost everything about the driving experience by changing the gear selector between Drive and Sport settings. Smoothness, however, is the main point of this car, as underlined by standard Continuously Controlled Damping, which monitors suspension settings 500 times per second and adjusts the suspension twenty times per second to tweak ride quality. While you’re enjoying that ride, there’s also a new lane keeping system that can warn you of potential accidents by making the steering wheel vibrate. What’s more, it’s customizable as to when alerts are sent and how hard they make the steering wheel vibrate. The MKS’s V-6 engine choices are slightly more powerful this year, with the most fuel-efficient choice being the 3.7-liter V-6 that makes 304 horsepower and provides 18 mpg in town and 27 mpg on the highway. An EcoBoost V-6 on the all-wheel-drive MKS ups horsepower to 365, although it offers slightly lower fuel economy at 17 mpg city and 25 mpg highway. The MKS’s looks are dominated by the new split grille, but updates have also been made to the fenders, headlamps, deck lid, rear end, and exhaust tips. The interior has an all-new instrument panel with MyLincoln Touch, an expanded Sync setup, and many new color schemes. Pricing range from $43,685 for the standard model to $50,685 for the EcoBoost model, including destination.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tAudi A6<br />\n2.\tInfiniti M<br />\n3.\tLexus GS<br />\n4.\tMercedes-Benz E-Class","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech:</strong><br />\n1.\tLane keeping technology is, as Lincoln puts it, an extra “eye” on the road.<br />\n2.\tLincoln Drive Control with Drive and Sport settings.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks:</strong><br />\n1.

Yes, it runs only thirty-eight miles on electric power alone—which is three miles more than last year’s model—and its rear seat is best suited for children, but consider the fuel economy: 98 mpg equivalent, in the EPA’s parlance for electric vehicles. The range-anxious will appreciate a new Hold Drive mode—added to the Volt’s Normal, Sport, and Mountain drive modes—which helps conserve battery life. On gasoline-only power, fuel economy is 37 mpg. Its fuel economy is aided by a set of Goodyear Fuel Max low-rolling-resistance tires, but they don’t appreciably hurt the ride quality. The Volt will hit a top speed of 100 mph—perhaps not the consideration uppermost on Volt buyers’ minds, but still—and, probably a number more of interest, it has a ten-to-sixteen-hour recharge time using standard household current.  Option packages add such amenities as heated front seats, perforated leather seating and steering wheel, a rear-view camera, and parking sensors at front and back. Lane departure warning and forward collision alert are other options, as is Chevrolet’s MyLink system with navigation. All that, and a range between fillups of 382 miles, if you take both the battery life and the fuel tank’s capacity into account.

Unfortunately, the Spark doesn’t astonish with great fuel economy: it makes 28 to 32 mpg in town and tops out at 38 mpg on the highway.

Five-speed manual and four-speed automatic transmissions are available, and despite its diminutive size, the Spark has a grown-up set of ten standard airbags. Chevrolet is aiming this, its first U.S.-market minicar, at city dwellers, which explains in part why it offers MyLink information and entertainment with a seven-inch color screen, Bluetooth streaming audio, and Pandora and Stitcher compatibility.

This mid-size sedan is available either as a four-cylinder/electric hybrid or with a standard or turbocharged four-cylinder engine, all of which are paired with a fuel-friendly six-speed automatic transmission. The hybrid version, called the Malibu Eco, has General Motors’ eAssist lithium-ion battery setup, giving the sedan a 37-mpg highway fuel economy rating. That’s impressive, but not the best you can do in today’s eco-competitive marketplace. The Eco model has been dressed up with metallic, chrome, or wood accents in the cockpit, plus ice blue ambient lighting and—surprise—a swiveling radio face that hides a six-inch-deep secret storage compartment. Chevrolet calls this “the quietest Chevrolet in history,” asking you to notice its use of sound-reducing and sound-absorbing materials inside the Malibu. While you’re enjoying the quiet, note the trendy dual cockpit and the presence of the Chevrolet MyLink information and entertainment system, standard on the Eco model. Even General Motors admits that the mid-size sedan segment is “vanilla,” but the company has worked hard to position the Malibu, now in its eighth generation, as a modern contender.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tHonda Accord<br />\n2.\tHyundai Sonata<br />\n3.\tToyota Camry<br />\n4.\tVolkswagen Passat","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421904,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421904/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items:</strong><br />\n1.\tEco model has eAssist, GM’s lithium-ion battery system.<br />\n2.\tRegenerative braking with Eco model provides up to fifteen kilowatts of energy to charge battery.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421907,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421907/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks: </strong><br />\n1.\tDual cockpit not to everybody’s taste, but different.<br />\n2.\t“Powerdome” hood a little aggressive for a mid-size sedan!","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421964,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421964/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>New for 2013:</strong><br />\n1.\tAll-new four-cylinder engine.<br />\n2.\tMore aerodynamically correct body style.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20498,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Malibu","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"Sedans","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20499,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Malibu","year":2013},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:09:51.952-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546191953 }} },{ "_id":222823,"title":"2013 Chevrolet Equinox","subTitle":"Another crossover that’s not really just another crossover.","slug":"2013-chevrolet-equinox","promoTitle":"2013 Chevrolet Equinox","promoTeaserSmall":"Another crossover that’s not really just another crossover.","promoTeaser":"Another crossover that’s not really just another crossover.","keywords":["2013 Chevrolet Equinox"],"metaTitle":"2013 Chevrolet Equinox Buyer's Guide -

This one is no exception; it gets a more powerful V-6 engine for 2013, without losing out on fuel economy—24 mpg on the highway—but otherwise it’s the tried-and-true smaller crossover that it has been for several years already. The interior is dependable and modern-looking, with blue ambient lighting and a wraparound dashboard with an upright center stack. The exterior has a sleek front end; its raked windshield and sweeping headlamps turn the Equinox into the anti-box. The base four-cylinder engine is no powerhouse, but it can get 32 mpg on the highway if you use the transmission-adjusting Eco mode. For those who want to use their crossover for towing, or just want more power, the newly added 3.6-liter V-6 makes 301 horsepower while adding 37 horsepower over last year’s smaller V-6 engine and, as previously mentioned, with no loss in fuel economy. This front-wheel-drive five-seater may not break any new ground in style or substance, but it is a good choice for anyone seeking a moderate amount of both attractiveness and versatility in a reasonably priced package.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tFord Escape<br />\n2.\tHonda CR-V<br />\n3.\tHyundai Santa Fe<br />\n4.\tToyota RAV4","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech: </strong><br />\n1.\tEco mode on four-cylinder engine. <br />\n2.\tLane departure warning system (option on top LTZ model). <br />\n3.\tNew suspension package for model with 3.6-liter V-6 engine.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks: </strong><br />\n1.\tPower liftgate.<br />\n2.\tNew Champagne Silver Metallic exterior color coming later in model year.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585478,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585478/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>New for 2013: </strong><br />\n1.

Fuel economy is okay but not brilliant, at 19 mpg in town and 26 mpg on the highway for the front-wheel-drive version.

There are dual power sunshades to go with all that opening to the sky. Technologically, there’s an expanded version of Ford Sync that includes WiFi hotspot capability and standard Operator Assist. Curve control, part of the MKX’s AdvanceTrac stability control system, helps keep you in control when taking fast curves. Optional technology includes collision warning with brake support, which uses radar to identify things you may be in danger of hitting. All that, and this is an attractive crossover, too.

In the meantime, there are no significant changes to the Mazda 6. The current generation sedan has a striking presence, with a long hood and flared front fenders. Mazda pitches it as being “sexy, yet sensible.” The base car is nicely equipped with standard air conditioning, power accessories, cruise control and a stereo system with six speakers. The base Mazda 6 is equipped with a 170-horsepower 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine linked to a six-speed manual transmission. The top-of-the-line model gets a 272-horsepower 3.7-liter V6 engine linked to a six-speed automatic transmission. There are numerous options, including a rear spoiler, remote engine start on automatic-transmission models, pearl exterior paint and a power moonroof.

The LR4 gets a 375-horsepower 5.0-liter V-8 engine linked to a six-speed automatic transmission. It’s an extremely trustworthy and burly beast that can tackle snow, sand, water, or mud with ease. It has four-wheel drive and a truck-based frame and is not a practical choice if you’re just going to take it to the mall and use it for the school car pool. Off-highway driving is where it shows its mettle, thanks to an adjustable air suspension and a fancy Terrain Response system. On the plus side, it costs less than a Range Rover. The LR4 is offered with an optional third row that boosts seating capacity to seven. You can load up the LR4 with lots of amenities, including an optional third-row bench that folds into the floor and an optional rear-seat entertainment system.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong>:<br/>\n1.

Sometimes you are motivated by concern about fuel economy and a small carbon footprint. And sometimes you are just plain too broke to buy anything bigger. Don’t feel deprived: the Chevrolet Sonic is actually pretty good. Available in both sedan and hatchback body styles, the U.S.-built Sonic weighs a pretty imposing 2,600 pounds and has ten standard airbags, so it’s no lightweight either literally or figuratively. Its four-cylinder engine choices are the same as those on the larger Cruze. There’s also a turbocharged RS sport hatchback, new this year, which will go on sale in late 2012. The RS’s sportiness is telegraphed by four-wheel disc brakes, a lowered ride height, more assertive chassis and transmission setups, and a leather-trimmed interior, plus red accents and aluminum pedals. You could actually plan to carry back-seat passengers without apologizing, thanks to a relatively roomy interior. An optional Connectivity and Cruise package adds a USB port, Bluetooth audio, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, and cruise control, and Chevrolet’s MyLink information and entertainment system is available on the uplevel LTZ model and the RS. All in all, you are sure to feel less penalized than you might have expected.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tFord Fiesta<br />\n2.\tHyundai Accent<br />\n3.\tKia Rio<br />\n4.\tNissan Versa","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421904,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421904/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items: </strong><br />\n1.“Three wet” paint process is water based, helping the environment.<br />\n2.

A true feast for the eyes, the LFA’s coupe-gone-wild styling is highlighted by massive air ducts and grilles all over the car, exquisite details like arrow-themed headlamps and spear-like boomerang-shaped taillamps, and a trio of exhaust pipes in the middle of the rear bumper. But the LFA’s wild styling only hints at the unbelievable experience that awaits any one lucky enough to slip behind the wheel on a long stretch of open road. The purpose-built V-10 rivals any Italian supercar in its thrust and song, while the steering serves up road feel as if on a silver platter. Two racing-style seats are all that fit in the LFA’s sexalicious interior and reconfigurable LCD gauges are truly state-of-the-art. Certainly, we’ll see that technology pop up on other Lexus models in the future, hopefully on vehicles less costly than the LFA, which Lexus brazenly slapped with a base price of $375K. For that coin, exclusivity also comes standard: production has been capped at 500 for the world, all sold as 2012 models. So why is this car listed in a 2013 buyer’s guide?

As a crossover and not a trucky SUV, and with only two rows of seats and not three (like Lexus’s other two luxury utes), the RX is spacious but not excessive, capable but not corpulent, comfortable but not conspicuously consumptive. In other words, for most moderately well-to-do households with a kid or two and a dog, it is just right. Now in the middle of its product cycle, Lexus has seen fit to give its popular RX a thorough face-lift, blessing the mug with the company’s new hourglass-shaped grille and LED daytime running lamp spears, complimented by new taillamps and tailgate details. The interior is slightly upgraded with some new color and trim choices and added technology such as Bluetooth connectivity and Lexus’s new Enform suite of in-car apps, including Pandora, Bing, Facebook, and more. With driving dynamics about as benign as your great aunt Matilda, the RX has never been too exciting to drive, though a new-for-2013 F-Sport model livens things up with its tightened suspension and paddle-shifted eight-speed transmission. And of course, the hybrid RX model (which, as Lexus proudly reminds us, was the industry’s first hybrid SUV) receives the same styling and interior enhancements as the standard model with considerably better fuel economy (30 mpg versus 21 mpg combined), albeit at a steep $6,600 premium. At least a laundry list of safety features come standard on all, most notably ten air bags, including knee airbags for the driver and front passenger.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

But it shouldn’t rest on its laurels, since General Motors recently announced that a new GMC Canyon and Chevrolet Colorado are in the pipeline. The Frontier is a strong contender in the meantime, with good engine choices, including a 261-horsepower 4.0-liter V-6 and an optional 152-horsepower 2.5-liter inline four-cylinder engine for the base King Cab 4x2 model. A five-speed manual transmission is standard on four-cylinder models, along with an optional five-speed automatic transmission or six-speed manual transmission for the rest of the lineup. The two-wheel-drive Frontier with the four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual transmission returns good fuel economy at 19 mpg in city driving and 23 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA.  The Frontier has a maximum towing capacity of 6,500 pounds, making it a decent workhorse. Serious truckers can opt for four-wheel-drive models with a locking rear differential, tough Bilstein shock absorbers, and skid plates. The Frontier has a smooth ride and better driving dynamics than many of its rivals, but the cabin looks dated with its cheap trim. The Frontier offers plenty of truck for the money, with a fully boxed chassis, steel construction, and leaf-spring rear suspension. But it’s anybody’s guess what the Motor City has in store when it debuts its new midsize trucks.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong>:<br/>\n1.

Oceans of hard plastic abound inside the Tundra, and particularly on two-door models, opening the doors can seem like moving a wall.

While the Tundra is offered in three cab styles, three comfort grades (SR5, Limited, and Platinum), and three bed lengths, it is not offered in the bewildering array of ways one can find at any of the established American brands, and nor is the Tundra offered with a diesel engine or a heavy-duty spec.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":29,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 4","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":58,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong>:<br/>\n1.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

In the name of science, we tested each car in the same categories: voice and manual entry of a point of interest (we used a favorite nearby lunch spot, Zingerman’s Bakehouse), voice and manual control of the radio, voice and manual adjustments to climate control, Bluetooth pairing of a phone, voice and manual control of the phone, and voice and manual selection of a song from an iPod.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>The Talking Car Is Real</strong><br/>\nThe first system we tested was Cue, from Cadillac.

Usually, it’s best to start with the general category or device you want to use. If you’re looking for directions, commands like “destination,” “point of interest,” or “navigation” will usually set you on the right path.

However, this did give us the opportunity to test the versatility of Internet search functions. Of the six systems, Audi's MMI and BMW's iDrive were able to find the Bakehouse with an impressively low amount of fuss. MMI integrates an online search into the Point of Interest menu. Once we were online, it was smooth sailing. BMW’s iDrive doesn’t connect to the Internet, but it does appear to have the most extensive POI database. Toyota's Entune was also able to find the Bakehouse by piggybacking onto the Internet provided by my iPhone to search Bing. Internet connectivity runs about $30 a month for Audi owners, and Entune services cost up to $45 per month, but only after a generous and free three-year subscription. The other systems failed to find the Bakehouse, altough if you happen to be driving a Cadillac equipped with OnStar (we were), you can make a phone call and have directions downloaded to your car’s navigation system quite quickly.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"I had my biggest battle on the navigation front with the beleaguered MyFord Touch system, which was able to find Zingerman’s Delicatessen (a sister restaurant), but stumbled on the final command.

All but two of the systems we tested used touchscreens for control of the infotainment system, with Audi MMI and BMW iDrive using rotary dials (combined with a PDA-like touchscreen with MMI which allows you to spell out words using your fingers). I far prefer using the rotary dial to select letters and move through the system, which I found to be substantially easier and less distracting than the touchscreen. (Let me now take a moment to remind you that entering text into your infotainment system while driving is a horrible idea. I know most people do it, but you shouldn’t.) That said, most of the touchscreens were acceptably responsive and precise, so it’s really just a matter of preference.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"For most of our other tests, the systems were all fairly competent. Audi MMI does not allow you to use voice commands to control an iPod or other music device, but it does allow you to select a song manually; if you fill up the in-car hard drive with music you can ask for a song by voice. I often had a hard time finding my way around the radio systems, but if you drove any of these cars every day you would become accustomed to its quirks quickly. Ford’s Sync system (separate from, but included with, MyFord Touch) and Cadillac’s Cue were particularly skilled at quick, seamless music selection.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"All the systems had easy, reliable steps for Bluetooth phone pairing.

It was the least frustrating and most intuitive to use, and it has a cool head-up display that displays your next navigation steps discreetly on the windshield so you can look like you know where you’re going even if you don’t.

She learned about cars at the kitchen table from her father Robert, the late editor of <em>Automotive News</em>. At the age of eighteen, she bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, Jennings went to Chrysler’s test track where she worked as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, she was hired as a writer at <em>Car and Driver</em> magazine when she was laid off her Chrysler job, and in 1985 she left to establish <em>Automobile Magazine</em> with David E. Davis, Jr., as its first executive editor. She became Editor-in-Chief in 2000 and added the title of President of <em>Automobile Magazine</em> in 2006.<br><br>\nJennings has won awards for her feature writing, for her car reviews, and for her monthly <em>Automobile Magazine</em> column “Vile Gossip.” She was the recipient of the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism. Jennings has the unique experience, sensibility, and personality to connect with women and to give them voice in the male-dominated automotive space. She was the subject of a Susan Orlean profile in the New Yorker, has appeared on numerous television news shows, has been on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and was <em>Good Morning America’s</em>

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Here's what I found out about them.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h4>Gold: Volkswagen Beetle Convertible</h4>\r\nHere at the Los Angeles show, backed by a Motown-style remix of the old Muzak hit “Sunny,” VW reaffirmed the droptop Beetle’s place in the chick-car pantheon. To be young, preferably with long, blond hair, and driving to the beach was the aesthetic. I’m none of those three things, but I still appreciate the idea of a cute little car that is all about having some fun while you drive.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"What I really like about this car is that VW retains the old-school soft convertible top, not a hard top, so it looks more like the original Beetles. That top goes down in 9.5 seconds and back up in 11.0 seconds, and you can be going as fast as 31 mph while doing so.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"Three Beetle convertibles were shown, each representing a decade. The 50s Edition is black, with a black soft top, a tan interior, seventeen-inch black alloy wheels, and chrome door mirrors. The 60s Edition is denim blue (or it can be white), with black-and-blue leather seats and a black soft top. The 70s Edition has a beige soft top, leather sport seats, and a choice of toffee metallic or gray metallic exterior paint. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"The look of this third-generation Beetle convertible is a bit sportier and more assertive. That’s because VW has lowered, widened, and lengthened the body slightly, gave it a wedgier side profile, and made the iconic bulbous hood longer. The anime-style big-eyed headlights are xenon, and there’s a rear spoiler. So it’s modernized and updated, but just as cute as it ever was, if not more.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"The new Beetle convertible goes on sale in December, with a base price of $24,995. The turbo starts at $31,195. Opt for the Beetle TDI ($27,895) with manual transmission and the two-liter TDI clean diesel, and you’ll be getting an estimated 41 mpg on the highway.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"There are those who call this a “chick car.” I am hereby reclaiming that term on behalf of women and taking it as a compliment that Volkswagen thinks it’s important to make a car women will enjoy.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h4>\r\nSilver: Fiat 500e</h4>\r\nI love everything about Italy, and I am a sucker for a car painted orange. So when a car is painted in Electrico Arancione Perla, no contest. Fiat introduced an electric orange, electric-powered version of its 500 minicar at the show. Even though it was sitting next to two other new 500 models, the  hot Abarth version and the five-door 500L, I only had eyes for the 500e.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"The 500e is going to be a city car, since it’s estimated to have eighty to 100 miles of range on a charge.

That could be a workable tradeoff for city dwellers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"The e-Sport package adds a touch of attitude to this cute car, with touches including blacked-out light surrounds and black-and-orange-accented aluminum wheels.

Fiat calls the look of this car  “retro futuristic.” ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"You don’t have to buy the 500e in orange, but why wouldn’t you? Okay, it comes in more subdued colors, such as black or white. The 500e goes on sale in the spring. \r\n<h4>\r\nBronze: Chevrolet Spark EV</h4>\r\nChevrolet rolled out its 2014 electric-powered Spark, which goes on sale next summer at a friendly $25,000 entry price with tax incentives. Good for those who want an EV, but won’t be springing for the much pricier Volt, the Spark also has a lot going for it besides price. Start with an optional SAE Combo DC fast charging package, which lets you charge this electric vehicle to 80 percent in twenty minutes. That ought to go a long way to combat range anxiety. GM says this new Spark is the first all-electric vehicle to get that option.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"Inside, you’ll find a pair of seven-inch color LCD screens that show vehicle functions—so you can obsess over battery life—and a host of connectivity functions such as MyLink radio, navigation, Internet radio, Pandora, and Stitcher.

The app uses data from GasBuddy.com, a website that provides gas prices across the United States and has charts on gas prices over time, trip cost calculators, and fuel saving tips. GasBuddy relies on users to update gas prices, but it seems to be fairly accurate. You can search for gas based on current location or use your city, state, or zip code, and you can search for diesel fuel as well as conventional gasoline. GasBuddy found gas one mile away from me for $3.16 per gallon at a gas station that didn’t show up on Octane’s search. To be fair, it was a gas station I couldn’t go to because it requires a loyalty card, but it seems like GasBuddy’s database still comes out ahead.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>Octane</h4><br/>\r\nThis free app, developed by WEX Inc, a fleet credit card provider, uses real-time data from gas purchases made using their cards. This means that the app only covers gas stations that accept WEX Inc’s cards, but in my test the app still turned up plenty of results. Octane also allows you to choose the search radius and type of fuel you're looking for – including listings for diesel, E85, and compressed natural gas. The app will also give you directions to the gas station of your choice starting from your current location. The cheapest gas Octane found for me was $3.34 per gallon for regular unleaded five miles away. That was about fifty cents per gallon cheaper than the gas station I would have gone to on my way home if left to my own devices.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h4>Diesel Power Fuel Finder</h4><br/>\r\nDiesel Power Fuel Finder focuses exclusively on finding gas stations in your location that sell diesel fuel. Users can specify a search radius, so if you need fuel within five miles, Fuel Finder won’t send you far afield. It doesn’t offer prices or search for other types of fuel, so if you don’t drive a diesel, don’t bother with this one.  Despite the irksome lack of price information, Fuel Finder has one cool feature that sets it apart. You can enter a destination, and the app will give you directions and highlight diesel stations you will pass by on your route.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Octane and GasBuddy are both available to Apple and Android users, while Fuel Finder is only available to the iPhone crowd.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"Diesel Power Fuel Finder","fileMasterId":41244044,"fileName":"diesel_tile.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41244044/diesel_tile.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"GasBuddy","fileMasterId":41244050,"fileName":"gasbuddy_622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41244050/gasbuddy_622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Octane","fileMasterId":45395292,"fileName":"octane_tile.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45395292/octane_tile.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":6,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-26T19:10:01.652-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1456546201653 }} },{ "_id":227025,"title":"Listen to the Internet with Aha App","subTitle":"","slug":"aha-app","promoTitle":"Listen to the Internet with Aha App","promoTeaserSmall":"Audio specialist Harman's Aha makes social media and Internet surfing into a listening experience.","promoTeaser":"Audio specialist Harman's Aha makes social media and Internet surfing into a listening experience.","keywords":["Aha App"],"metaTitle":"Listen to the Internet with Aha App - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Aha Radio","Harman Aha","Aha app","listening apps for the car","radio app for the car","audio apps","audiobooks in the car","listening to podcasts and social media","iPhone app","Android app"],"metaDescription":"Listen to the Internet with Aha App: Read about the Aha radio app that lets you listen to Internet and social media as well as audiobooks, radio stations, and podcasts.

This is a program that is administered by a dealership and helps ensure you are getting a reliable vehicle that has been checked out before it's put up for sale.

The warranty’s length will differ depending on the manufacturer. Some warranties will start from the in-service date, or the date that its first owner drove it home from the dealership. Seeing the words “in-service date” should be a hint to direct your attention to the odometer immediately. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Since you’re buying used, the car will have miles on it already, meaning you’re likely to exhaust the mileage limit of the warranty before the age limit. For example, if you buy a CPO with 55,000 miles on it and a standard ten-year or 100,000-mile warranty, you’ve only got 45,000 miles left before the warranty expires.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Other warranties will start on either the date of certified purchase or when the new car warranty expires if you buy a CPO that is still under the original warranty. This means that the number of miles that the car has accumulated prior to the time it came into your possession don’t count against you. So if you do buy that CPO with the 55,000 miles on it, the warranty on the car will start when you drive it off the lot and will expire when you’ve reached 155,000 miles. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h4>You'd Better Shop Around</h4>\r\nUnless you know exactly which car you want to buy, it’s a good idea to shop around for the manufacturer with the best CPO program as well as for the car that’s right for you. Not only are all cars and their respective warranties different, but the benefits and terms of the programs vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. To give you a sample what CPO programs have to offer, here are two examples of two very different manufacturers with different, but attractive, programs. \r\n\t\r\n<h4>Example 1: Kia</h4>\r\n•\tTo qualify to be a certified pre-owned car, a Kia vehicle must be five years old or less, have fewer than 60,000 miles on the engine, and pass a 150-point inspection. Each of the vehicles comes with a ten-year, 100,000-mile limited powertrain warranty that covers the repair of major vehicle parts, like the engine and transmission. In addition to the powertrain warranty, you can elect to extend you coverage benefits and the your length coverage up to an addition 100,000 miles by choosing one of four protection plans. With the plans also come rental car, towing, and travel coverage (should your car breakdown when you’re 100 miles away from home) and financing.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"•\tTo help you with maintenance visits, Kia also offers two servicing plans to cover oil changes, brake adjustments, tire rotations, and preventive care. The service plans also come with Cross Country Motor Club membership.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"•\tDepending on the state you live in, coverage plans for tire and wheel replacement or repair are also available. They are three, four, or five year plans that cover up to $40 in tire repairs. Based on the plan you choose, you can either receive up to $200 in tire or wheel replacement and a lifetime maximum of $1,200 for repairs or replacements or a $5,000 lifetime maximum for repairs or replacements.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<h4>Example 2: Mercedes-Benz</h4>\r\n•\tMercedes-Benz CPOs are six years old or less, have less than 75,000 miles, and are required to pass a 164-point inspection process. If the car is less than four years old or has less than 50,000 miles on the odometer, it will still be under the original, new car warranty. After the car turns four or reaches 50,000 miles, the certified pre-owned limited warranty begins and runs for a year or up to 100,000 miles, whichever comes first. If the car is four years or older at the time of certified purchase, then the one-year, or 100,000-mile warranty starts the day you buy it. Like Kia, Mercedes-Benz allows you to extend your CPO warranty, but for either one year, or 120,000 miles; or two years, or 135,000 miles. If you choose to sell your car to another person, the extended warranty can be transferred.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"•\tTwenty-four-hour roadside assistance is also part of Mercedes-Benz’s CPO program. Mercedes-Benz also has travel coverage that reimburses you for expenses incurred over three days in the event that Mercedes breaks down on you while you and the car are away from home. <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"•\tPurchasing a Mercedes-Benz CPO also entitles you to exchange it for another CPO vehicle if you are not satisfied with your first purchase. The exchange must occur within seven days or 500 miles. You can exchange your car for a CPO of equal or greater value, but you will be required to pay the difference.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<h4>Odds Are in Your Favor</h4>\r\nThanks to the proliferation of CPO programs, a dealership is a more user-friendly place than ever to shop for a used vehicle. Take advantage of the ability to get documentation about any vehicle you're considering. That will help you make a really informed decision about which car will be your next car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"<em>Car shopping?

You probably already describe things at home: “Look, Molly, this book is red. It has a green duck on the cover. See?” Transfer that skill over to the car: “Look, Molly, I am pulling the car in to a parking space between those two white lines. I am going very slowly and watching to make sure there are no cars and no people so everybody will be safe… See how the man wants to cross the street? I am stopping, and now I am waving my hand to let him go. He’s smiling! That’s nice.” Suddenly Molly is sharing in the process and being taught about what should be in a driver’s head: paying attention to the tasks and making good choices to protect the safety of others.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>2.\tTalk about the signs, directions, and road types you encounter.</h4> Perhaps you already say things like, “That’s a stop sign. It means I have to stop for a minute and look to see if other cars are coming.” Or perhaps your child has asked about road signs. You can go beyond that to talk about more advanced topics such as the no-passing lane, the cameras at some intersections, and the way a traffic roundabout works. You can point out the differences in roads from a country dirt road to an Interstate and talk about the way you handle going into a broad turn, merging onto a highway, and moving out of the way for emergency vehicles.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"You could also tie your description to choices you make while you drive: “Look, Molly, that car is going really fast. I am going to go to the right lane—this part of the road between the lines—because the rule is that cars can go past me in the left lane—this part of the road over here. I wish he would go a little more slowly but we will be safe and stay on our side so he can get past safely.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>3.\tAsk questions that help your child learn safety decision making.</h4> When you enter a parking lot, ask your child, “Do you think we should park over here, where there aren’t very many cars? Or do you think we should go up close to the store even though there are lots of people walking? What should I do to make it safer for everybody?” Or ask, “When it’s snowing this hard, what do you think the joggers should do? How can I drive so they are safer? What would be the safest thing?” Open-ended questions can lead to a good discussion of safety rules and can also make driving more interesting for kids.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Another thing to consider is that children ride in cars with lots of people who aren't you: babysitters, caregivers, other parents during outings and play dates, grandparents, even (gulp!) older siblings who drive. It's up to you to make sure you and your child are on the same page and your rules are clearly understood. Then your kid will know what to do when climbing into someone else's car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h4>\r\n4.\tInvolve your child in the maintenance and repair process.</h4> If you take your car in for an oil change, bring your child with you and look at the checklist together.  (“Look, Charlie, our car has five quarts of oil in it.  The workers just drained it out and put in clean, fresh oil to help all the parts move smoothly. Do you know how big a quart is? It’s this much!”) If you take your car in for a repair or after an accident, involve your child in the process. Let him or her take some before-and-after photos, look up information about the repair on the Internet, and let him or her meet the mechanic and glimpse the work being done whenever possible. I would especially suggest this for girls—who are less likely to be included in this kind of discussion and will then reach age sixteen at a disadvantage next to more mechanically savvy boys.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h4>\r\n5.\tModel appropriate behavior, attitude, and choices.</h4> This is probably the most important thing to do when children are in your car. Actually, you should model appropriate behavior no matter who is riding with you. Be a thoughtful, caring, and rational person when you drive. Anger, impatience, and selfishness may not be officially prohibited by law when you drive, but they’re dangerous.

Make sure he or she walks into that eventual driver education class with a solid foundation in how a grownup looks, acts, and thinks when behind the wheel. It’s only a matter of a few years before “Look both ways” elicits an eye roll.

Treat the car the way you want them to treat it, inside and out.</strong> Do you blame the mess inside your car on your kids? Perhaps, like baby weight, that excuse no longer works when your child is in seventh grade. Having a lot of loose things rolling around—books, CDs, shoes, or whatever you stash in your car—is unsafe, since these objects can become projectiles in an accident or a sudden stop. A car without adequate washer fluid, or caked in dirt that makes it hard to see out the windows, can pose safety hazards as well. Besides, it’s not conducive to quality of life. Get your kids used to the idea that things get put away in the trunk or storage area, and the car gets washed. You can even add it to their chore lists. Brilliant!</ol>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<ol>\r\n<strong>2. Take a cooperative attitude toward other drivers.</strong> Make constructive and positive comments about the driving process in front of the kids.

Include your middle schooler in maintenance and repair issues.</strong> I remember first learning about oil changes and tire rotations when I actually owned a car. I may have been unusually dense, of course. Show your middle schooler what an owner's manual is and what’s inside it. Let him or her show <em>you</em> how to look up maintenance information on your car online. Go to the oil change place together; involve your child in picking out new tires.

Nearly any child aged ten and up is ready to start working on that body of knowledge. You can go even further and get your <a href= http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,1607,7-127-1642-103522--,00.html rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">state’s driving manual</a> for your curious tween to look at.</ol>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<ol>\r\n<strong>5.

Go to races, collector-car auctions, and car museums together. Play some of the nonviolent driving games you can find on the Internet and in the App Store. Find adult mentors who like to work on cars. Save up to send your child to an advanced driving school later on.

But, as a doting helicopter parent with ready access to statistics, it is the temptation to text from behind the wheel that puts me in a cold panic. Ignoring the ping of a cell phone text -- even for the fifteen-minute drive to school -- is difficult for a teen. In their world, not answering a text immediately has dire consequences. That trash-texting hottie will move on if you ignore her sext for more than five minutes. Parties get planned, decisions made, and friendships evolve in that amount of time. I’m a parent, so I’m congenitally unable to understand any of this, but I have all this on good authority. I’m assuming that’s why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that 58 percent of high school seniors report they have recently texted or e-mailed while driving, and why an AT&T Wireless survey found that 75 percent of teens say texting and driving is common among them – even though I’m sure their parents warned them against it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h4>The Danger Is Obvious</h4>Texting while driving is as dangerous – perhaps more dangerous – than drinking and driving.

Cole actually welcomed the idea, especially if the tool I used would send an automatic text informing his friends he was driving and would get back to them at a stoplight.

When you open the doors, you’ll also admire the way it looks and feels inside, and that’s where Helen Emsley comes in.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"She’s the director of interior design for performance cars, full-size trucks, and large crossovers for Chevrolet and GMC.

And the co-driver has their own controls for heat and cooling and a grip handle that they can actually hold on to.\n \nWe wanted a really nice red that matches the red exterior, and we added a medium sandy beige and dark brown to our five interior colors.

Chevrolet announced the new addition to the Cruze lineup last week at the Chicago Auto Show, and it's the first time the GM division has sold a diesel passenger car on this continent in several decades.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"A diesel sedan may be a tough sell for American buyers, thanks to the loud, smelly diesel offerings many drivers remember from the 1980s. This diesel is different, though. If your opinion of diesel is stuck in the past, here are five reasons you should give it a second look.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h4>1. New, Better Technology</h4>\nDiesel has been rebranded as clean diesel, and it has the credentials to prove it. Not only does the new Cruze diesel engine emit 90 percent less nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions than the previous generation of diesel engines, but Robert Bosch LLC, a big provider of clean diesel technology, says that diesel engines in general produce 25 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than an equivalent gasoline engine.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>2. More Efficient, Longer Range</h4>\nGasoline engines only use about 30 percent of their energy to power a car, which isn’t really all that efficient. Diesel engines convert 45 to 50 percent of their energy to power, so there’s less wasted potential. This translates to good fuel economy, especially at cruising speeds. Many diesel sedans on sale now earn between 40 and 43 mpg on the highway, easily achieving a goal that gasoline-powered cars have to strive for.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Good fuel economy also means good range. With the Cruze’s expected 42-mpg highway rating and 15.6-gallon fuel tank, it could go well over 600 miles on a fill-up. Volkswagen and Audi’s various TDI models all have similar figures. By way of comparison, a 2013 Cruze with a traditional 1.8-liter gasoline engine and a manual transmission earns 36 mpg on the highway and, at that rate, would go about 100 fewer miles between fill-ups at cruising speed.  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>3. Plenty of Fun to Drive</h4>\r\nAmerican automakers have long offered diesel engines in their heavy duty pickup trucks, and diesel is the backbone of the trucking industry. Despite their wide application as workhorses, though, a diesel-powered vehicle can also be fun. Part of what makes diesel so attractive for commercial uses is high low-end torque. A gasoline engine typically reaches peak torque above 4,000 rpm, but a diesel engine car tends to reach peak torque below 3,000 rpm. This makes diesel engines ideal for towing, but it also gives them some extra kick off the starting blocks, which adds to the fun of driving.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h4>4. Great Durability</h4>\nDiesel engines are composed of sturdier parts than gasoline engines, and they operate at lower speeds (thanks again to the low-end torque), so they can last longer without needing major repairs. Jean and Tim Jennings are hoping for half a million miles from their diesel-powered <a href=http://www.jeanknowscars.com/videos/car-reviews/2013-volkswagen-jetta-sportwagen-tdi target=\"_blank\">Jetta SportWagen</a>. It’s an unusual owner who would expect to get that many miles out of a gasoline powerplant.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h4>5. Lower Cost of Ownership</h4>\r\nFor many buyers, the deciding factor between buying a diesel and sticking with a gasoline engine will be cost. Diesel cars can initially cost more than their gasoline counterparts–and diesel fuel is typically more expensive. But, over time, and depending on the car, diesel-powered cars may have a lower cost of ownership. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"Yes, the price displayed at the gas station is higher for diesel. But diesel’s significantly better fuel economy means that many owners actually save money on fuel compared with a car with a gasoline engine. This, combined with the higher resale value that diesel cars enjoy, means that many owners end up saving money over the life of the car. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"One example: In a 2012 University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute study, a Volkswagen Jetta TDI was $3,108 less expensive to own over a period of three years than its gasoline counterpart.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Soapbox","id":1034787,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/soapbox","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[{"articleId":337020,"name":"article0","promoImage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-17T17:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Danica Patrick","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43603220/Danica-300.jpg","fileMasterId":43603220,"fileName":"Danica-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"promoTeaser":"Danica Patrick will be the first woman to start a race from the pole in NASCAR Sprint Cup history.","title":"Fast Women: Patrick Makes History","url":"/you-auto-know/fast-women/fast-women-danica-patrick/"}],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-25T12:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Danica Patrick","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48572796/Danica-300.jpg","fileMasterId":48572796,"fileName":"Danica-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-25T11:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Danica Patrick","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43355545/Danica-02.jpg","fileMasterId":43355545,"fileName":"Danica-02.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-25T11:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Danica Patrick","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43769591/Danica-Patrick-.jpg","fileMasterId":43769591,"fileName":"Danica-Patrick-.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":978}}},"pages":[{"id":456276,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"left","altText":"Danica Patrick","caption":"","fileMasterId":43355542,"fileName":"Danica_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43355542/Danica_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":0,"text":"The Daytona 500 is over, and Danica Patrick delivered, underscoring the <a href=http://www.jeanknowscars.com/features/style/fast-women-danica-patrick/ target=\"_blank\">historic achievement</a> of being the first woman to win the pole for NASCAR’s most important race. Patrick drove in the top pack all Sunday afternoon. It’s also a rare accomplishment for the pole sitter to win this long and always eventful race, but she led it twice, for five laps under green-flag conditions, thereby breaking another gender barrier.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"When the white flag waved, signaling the start of the two hundredth and final lap on this monstrous, tricky, narrow track, Patrick held third place. She stayed third through turns one and two, still running the preferred high line, and everybody held his or her breath, hoping for a bold move on the back straightaway.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Danica Patrick","caption":"","fileMasterId":48569727,"fileName":"Danica_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48569727/Danica_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":2,"text":"Instead, by the time she emerged from turn four and headed home, five NASCAR veterans had interposed themselves between her and the finish line. Jimmie Johnson won it—for a payday above $1.5 million—and Patrick was eighth. Her most preeminent precursor, Janet Guthrie, had once finished sixth in a NASCAR race at Bristol, Tennessee—as well as leading the 1977 Daytona 500 under a yellow flag—so Patrick still has one mark to shoot for.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"Some drivers would have rejoiced at the top-ten finish. Instead, Patrick, 30, who nearly won the Indianapolis 500 in 2005 while breaking all Guthrie’s records there, and later, in 2008, did win the Indy Japan 300, convincingly restrained any jubilation after climbing from her Chevrolet. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"“If I was going to dive low,” she said, pausing to cackle disdainfully at the thought, “I had a feeling I was gonna get freight-trained.” Because of how cars run faster together than alone, she might have finished eighteenth, not eighth.  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>What It Means</h4>\r\nNevertheless, it’s easy to assess the outcome as a major accomplishment. Women everywhere--and a whole lot of men, too--were almost giddy with excitement before the race. One friend of ours, a woman almost as petite as Patrick, said she became a NASCAR fan again. She had tuned out after being present at Daytona in 2001, when the great Dale Earnhardt was killed. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"“This race meant a lot,” our friend e-mailed. “I was in tears today with respect, happiness, awe, passion, and triumph. It was a historic day for women drivers and women in the field.” ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"Beyond reconciling an old fan and maybe winning new ones, Patrick’s achievement is the bellwether for how the sport is now viewed—and not so much from the inside out. No longer the bastion of retrograde Southern culture, NASCAR today is full of sophisticated and large-minded people. They come from every corner of the country, from Formula 1, Indy racing—even Australia. Five-time NASCAR champion Johnson is a San Diegan; in two weeks, he’ll compete in an exhibition event that includes surfing, car racing, and skiing all in the same day. Hard to imagine the sport’s old moonshining pioneers being able to relate. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"Beyond the garage area, though, some changes could indeed be made. The cringe factor had already started percolating days before the race when an interviewer asked Patrick if, finding herself in Victory Circle, she would adhere to the old tradition of kissing the trophy girl. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"And during the race’s broadcast, the awkward comments included honorary starter James Franco’s command, “Drivers—and Danica—start your engines!” Later on, did we really need to hear about Patrick’s romantic pas de deux with another driver? \"Take a shot every time they mention Danica and Ricky’s relationship,” @robstewart93 tweeted. “That’ll get you drunk fast.\"","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<h4>This Is What We Call a Role Model</h4>\r\nWhile still a teenager, Patrick went from dropping out of school in Roscoe, Illinois, to racing in England, enduring many travails in the process; as much as learning to handle cars, she learned to handle herself. She’s used to the fawning and the flubbing. After winning the pole, she handled the immense pressure with grace. And how she raced did nothing to make Jeff Gordon’s five-year-old daughter, Ella, regret her request for a photo with the fastest qualifier.
