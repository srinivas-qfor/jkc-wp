It is rated at 47 mpg both in town and on the highway—which Ford hastens to point out is 7 mpg better than the Toyota Prius v’s highway numbers. The C-Max has a lithium-ion battery that recharges when the gasoline engine is in use; plus, there’s regenerative braking—recycling at its least onerous—which recaptures up to 95 percent of the energy used in braking and uses it to recharge the battery. The C-Max is not only efficient; it also responds to the eco-conscious aesthetic by using a greenery theme in its Smartgauge display, which displays more leaves and vines as a “visual reward” when a driver is more efficient in his or her driving habits. The C-Max’s popular price, starting just over $25,000—lower than its closest rival, the Toyota Prius, and some $10,000 cheaper than the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf—will help it win fans, as will its uncontroversial styling. The fact that you can drive the plug-in Energi at speeds up to 85 mph on electrical power alone should electrify the highway commuter crowd.

Long a traditional rear-wheel-drive SUV, the Explorer was completely remade for 2011 into a front-wheel-drive/all-wheel-drive crossover. It even comes with the option of a four-cylinder engine. That hasn’t changed its reputation as a go-anywhere utility vehicle, though. Teamed with all-wheel drive on V-6-powered models is Ford’s optional Terrain Management. This system lets you dial in the vehicle’s response to the surfaces on which you’re traveling, using pictograms for grass/gravel/snow, sand, mud/ruts, or normal. There’s also Hill Descent Control, which takes over the braking duties when you go downhill, so you can concentrate on steering. Other helpful features include adaptive cruise control, a blind-spot warning system, and parking assist. The Explorer Sport model gives you both more power and more style, with 350 horsepower from a twin-turbo V-6 engine, a set of twenty-inch wheels, and contrast stitching on the seats. As for fuel economy, you can get 28 mpg on the highway, but only if you forgo all-wheel drive and get the four-cylinder engine. With the V-6 and AWD, you’ll get 23 mpg on the highway, and the Explorer Sport tops out at 22 mpg highway. It’s not the most exciting product on the market, either to drive or to look at—but for those who want to haul stuff, carry up to seven people, and feel more like a rugged adventurer than a boring commuter, the Explorer is a popular choice.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong><br />\n6.5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br/>\n1.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]},{"id":10367,"roles":["Photographer"],"displayName":"Gabrielle George","firstName":"Gabrielle","lastName":"George","jobTitle":"Photo Intern","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"I am Gabrielle Taylor George, and I graduated in 2011 from Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the city I was born and raised in.

Great Falls—now an enclave of substantial wealth—was then a rural Virginia community, and some of us really did have to walk a mile in the sun or snow to get to our bus stop. One cold day, one of the Klett boys—cute high schoolers who lived down the road—stopped his white Ford Bronco and asked if I wanted a ride home. My heart a bit aflutter, I tried to get in, but the Bronco lacked a running board for the vertically challenged. Between my short legs, girth, and complete lack of flexibility, I couldn’t step up into the car. I had to be hauled into the Bronco like a beached whale…and I wanted to die, right then and there.

Instead, the new model has an MDX-like smooth plastic interior and classy beige seats. On the outside, the RDX looks like a mini-me of the seven-passenger MDX, but the association is by no means damaging. More important, a smaller V-6 engine is both more powerful and more fuel-efficient than the old RDX, coming in at 19 to 20 mpg city, 27 to 28 mpg highway. The new RDX is also better around corners and smoother over bumps. Better yet, it received top scores for safety from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The basic package comes with heated seats, a power moonroof, Bluetooth connectivity, and a USB audio input so that you never have to listen to radio commercials again. All this at a much lower price point than its big brother the MDX. So, what’s not to like? Not much. Less space than some larger crossovers and occasionally jerky shifts, but the new RDX is a huge improvement over older models, and it won’t leave you wanting more.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"left","altText":"Competitors","caption":"","fileMasterId":42026077,"fileName":"Competitors1.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42026077/Competitors1.jpg","imageSize":"inline_small","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br/>\n1.

It benefits from a sleek looking dash and information display, although the navigation system itself could use an update. Smooth leather seats come standard, as do keyless entry and a USB port and auxiliary jack for MP3 players. Change is in the air for the RL, however. After a long history as Acura’s respectable, refined sedan, the RL will become the 2014 RLX, for sale in early 2013. The new model will be bigger and heavier, and will come in a “sport hybrid” model, which Acura expects to achieve 30 mpg – a huge improvement over the current model’s 24 mpg on the highway. The RL provides more than enough comfort and drivability for its nearly $50,000 price point, but it could use a touch more excitement, which is probably exactly what the RLX will have in store.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 4","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Previous TLs sported a love-it-or-hate-it beak-like snout; the new incarnation is much more refined. The real changes are on the outside, but the TL does now offer optional creamy Milano leather seats. The TL allows drivers to choose between two engines: 280-horsepower V-6 with a six-speed automatic transmission or a 305-horsepower engine with a six-speed manual transmission. If you know your way around a clutch, the manual is refreshingly smooth. The smaller engine is an improvement over previous five-cylinder models, but the 300-horsepower manual has more pickup and handles tight turns better than the automatic. The TL’s fuel economy is respectable at 17 to 20 mpg city and 25 to 29 mpg highway. Like the RL, the TL has a dated navigation system and cluttered climate and audio controls. Despite minor deficiencies, the redesign gracefully handled most of the TL’s problems, leaving behind a car that both looks and feels more like luxury.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Once the bestselling SUV from Europe, the XC90 has fallen way behind the curve, and the piddling updates for 2013 will hardly mitigate this laxity. If an important Volvo nameplate has suffered as the result of changes in Volvo’s corporate status, it’s the XC90. It’s the story of how a good-looking face can become merely familiar. The XC90 originated the trim, urbane look in the full-size crossover segment, but nothing has been done with that in years. And problems accelerated, so to speak, when the excellent V-8 departed the engine bay. Now left with the 236 horsepower 3.2-liter six-cylinder and six-speed automatic transmission as the only powertrain, the XC90 is dated and finds itself at a significant disadvantage to competitors; meager power output combines with mediocre fuel economy. For 2013, there are a few new items: for example, a leather strap on the tailgate, red wood trim in the interior, and white lighting for the instrumentation. The list of safety features looked good a few years ago, but today the XC90 even lags behind other Volvos in this aspect. The most important new feature it can receive is a refresh button.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Babies","id":1034771,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/kids-in-the-car/babies","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Safety ","id":1023754,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/car-safety","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"All Videos","id":1023756,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Kids in the Car","id":1034769,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[{"articleId":222737,"name":"article0","promoImage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T17:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40483418/what-car-seat-when+promo-large.jpg","fileMasterId":40483418,"fileName":"what-car-seat-when+promo-large.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":300},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":533}},"promoTeaser":"Yes, your eight-year-old still needs a car seat.

But poor Dodge wouldn’t know about that; it hasn’t been a player in that segment for decades. When its current offering, the Avenger, came along in 2008, adopting the window treatment and muscular rear fenders of the big Charger sedan, customers ran in horror once they drove it—that is, if they could get past the wretched interior. Dodge gave the Avenger a thorough make-over for 2011, although no one seemed to notice, since the bulk of the work was done in places no one could see. The car’s sloppy handling was cleaned up, and a fabulous new 283-horsepower V-6 engine was offered. With its standard six-speed automatic transmission, V-6-powered Avengers achieve decent fuel economy (29 mpg highway). A four-cylinder model is offered, too, although with its antiquated four-speed automatic, highway mileage is not a lot better (31 mpg). The interior was simply revolutionized, with soft-touch material everywhere, edgy new color schemes, and handy connectivity features. In the end, the Avenger became a decent car overall. However, that was 2011, and nothing about the Avenger has changed much since then…except, that is, its competitive set, which now includes fresher (and better) mid-sizers from pretty much every carmaker that offers one. The Avenger’s sole claim to fame for 2013 is its status as the cheapest entry in the segment, as it should be. Its replacement is expected by 2014, which can’t come soon enough for Dodge.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Cadillac is promoting this car in grand style, aiming it at people who would otherwise be looking at German performance cars. In fact, Cadillac has had BMW’s 3-series and other German sport sedans in its sights for years. With the ATS, which it tested at Germany’s Nürburgring racetrack, among other places, it may have hit the target. What’s most interesting about the ATS? It weighs less than 3,400 pounds, pretty slim for its size. It is a traditional rear-wheel-drive sport sedan, but all-wheel drive is also available. Cadillac makes much of the car’s fifty-fifty weight balance, ultra-efficient and driver-adjustable sport suspension, Brembo brakes, and long, sleek body on a 109.3-inch wheelbase. But what you’ll notice even before you take off are the interior elements. There’s carbon fiber, wood, and metal plate trim; a wraparound instrument panel with LED lighting on the gauges; and a full palette of color schemes. You can dress it up with Bose stereo, navigation, the Cadillac User Experience information and entertainment system with eight-inch touchscreen, and performance seats with power-adjustable bolsters. Safety options are the complete package, too: intelligent brake assist, forward collision alert, lane departure warning, a rear-vision camera, and side blind zone alert, among others. But what Cadillac wants you to take most to heart is a thrilling driving experience from the 272-horsepower four-cylinder turbo engine.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tBMW 3-Series<br />\n2.\tMercedes-Benz C250<br />\n3.\tAudi A4<br />","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421904,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421904/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech:</strong><br />\n1.\tCadillac User Experience information/entertainment system, making its debut on the XTS and ATS this year.<br />\n2.\tFront and rear automatic brakes use short-range radar technology and ultrasonic sensors to prevent low-speed collisions.<br />\n3.\tFive-link independent rear suspension, a first for Cadillac.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421907,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421907/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks:</strong><br />\n1.\tThey call it Art & Science design language; we call it ruggedly handsome, even sexy.<br />","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"Sedans","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20244,"make":"Cadillac","model":"ATS","year":2013},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":10},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:02:01.964-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865321964 }} },{ "_id":222294,"title":"2013 Acura TSX","subTitle":"Acura’s sporty sedan comes with seemingly endless choices","slug":"2013-acura-tsx","promoTitle":"2013 Acura TSX","promoTeaserSmall":"2013 Acura TSX","promoTeaser":"2013 Acura TSX","keywords":["2013 Acura TSX"],"metaTitle":"2013 Acura TSX Buyer's Guide - Jean Knows Cars","metaKeywords":["2013","acura","txs","buyers guide"],"metaDescription":"2013 Acura TSX Buyer's Guide","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2012-09-26T15:31:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2012-09-26T15:31:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"buyer_guide","webExclusive":false,"url":"/new-cars/acura/2013-acura-tsx/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[],"categories":[{"alias":"Acura","id":1025649,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/new-cars/acura","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"new-cars","id":1024395,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/new-cars","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-10-29T18:23:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"acura-tsx-2014-header","title":"Acura Tsx 2014 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/83524579/acura-tsx-2014-header.jpg","fileMasterId":83524579,"fileName":"acura-tsx-2014-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}}},"pages":[{"id":238930,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The 2013 Acura TSX makes no changes from the 2012 model year, but it comes with enough options to make up for it.

Acura’s silky-smooth manual transmission is available in the sedan. The TSX compliments its punchy engine with a new, smoother suspension. The sedan has a paltry 12.6 cubic feet of trunk storage, but this car was clearly not built to move a family cross-country, and with its other features you might not miss the space. If you do need more room in the back, the wagon has twice the cargo space of the sedan. Believe it or not, a car this fun to drive doesn’t have to be a gas guzzler. At 19 to 22 mpg in the city and 28 to 31 mpg on the highway, the TSX is more efficient than Acura’s more sedate (read: boring) sedans.

Being a plus-sized model in the crossover utility class has its advantages, chief among them being how eight passengers can fit inside more comfortably than in some minivans (a seven-seat configuration is optional, with second-row captains chairs and a center console). The standard Acadia is available in four trim levels as well as a blingy Denali grade, the latter bringing more shiny surfaces than a disco ball and a considerably upgraded interior with a gorgeous, brown leather upholstery option. Cargo room is the best thing this side of a minivan: the Acadia can accommodate a four-foot-wide sheet of plywood inside. Every Acadia is powered by a 3.6-liter V-6 with 288 horsepower paired to a six-speed automatic transmission; an “intelligent” all-wheel-drive system is the only powertrain-related option. It’s hardly fast, but it can get out of its own way just fine. Speaking of getting out of the way, the Acadia (along with the other members of GM’s crossover trio) comes with the industry’s first front center air bag, which deploys between the front seats to prevent occupants’ heads from hitting each other in a side collision or rollover, yet another reason to like a vehicle wherein there is a lot to like already.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Full-size vans are generally little more than big, graceless transportation appliances designed not for the driver, but rather for what’s behind him or her. So who’s going to notice—or care, really—that the Savana hasn’t changed much for the last sixteen years? Probably no one, unless they know that Ford just launched its all-new, full-sized 2013 Transit van, that Nissan sells a big box called NV, or that Ram is rumored to be launching a replacement for the Dodge Sprinter, which, by the way, is still sold here by Mercedes-Benz. Compared with all of those, the Savana feels decidedly old-school, and less roomy. And while it offers a slew of engines ranging from a puny V-6 to an E85-capable gasoline V-8 to a torque-laden 6.6-liter diesel V-8, and has added park assist, a rear camera, and navigation-assisted radio options, the Savana is unremarkable and outdated.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 1","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The level of feature content is high, however, and fit and finish—a strong suit of GM’s of late—are excellent. Close your eyes (as a passenger, of course) and the smooth ride and quiet cabin may fool you into thinking you’re in a Lexus RX350, particularly in the case of the new-for-2013 Denali model, with its upgraded front shocks. The Denali also features an even glitzier grille, unique wheels, smoked mahogany trim, French seams, and a soft-touch dashboard. But you don’t have to spend Denali money to enjoy the Terrain’s huge, sliding back seat, excellent ergonomics, and complimentary six months of OnStar services. Power brokers may prefer the newly available 301-horsepower V-6, while efficiency-minded customers may gravitate to the 182-horsepower four-cylinder engine that features a transmission with “eco” mode. Even with optional all-wheel drive, the Terrain breaks little ground (pardon the pun) in the market, but it straddles the line between the mainstream and luxury ends of the mid-size SUV crossover class, and as such, is reasonably priced.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

But big changes are on tap for the new model year as the 2013 LR2 gets a smaller engine with an eye toward improved fuel economy. The baby Land Rover gets a new 240-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine replacing the previous 3.2-liter inline six-cylinder engine. The new engine is borrowed from the 2012 Range Rover Evoque and is 88 pounds lighter than the outgoing inline six-cylinder engine it replaces. The engine is linked to a six-speed automatic transmission. The EPA has yet to provide the most critical information about the redesign – namely, the fuel economy, but the numbers are expected to be significantly better. In the meantime, buyers should be prepared to shell out more for the 2013 model, since the base crossover gets a $700 price increase. The 2013 Land Rover LR2 starts at $37,250, which is still cheaper than the BMW X3, one of its chief rivals. The LR2 gets a mini- makeover said to give it a sportier look. The LR2’s cabin also borrows items from the Evoque, including a new center console. Off-roaders will appreciate the fact that, despite the overhaul, the LR2 retains the same 8.3-inch minimum of ground clearance to play hard on rocky, sandy, rutted, or muddy terrain.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Evoque marked a major shift for the British brand, which had been known for its boxy SUVs designed to tackle the harshest environment. The Evoque is showing the brand’s softer side. Victoria Beckham, the fashion designer and former Spice Girl, even created an Evoque Special Edition last spring, complete with a matching set of luggage, but the special model has yet to debut on the U.S. market. In the meantime, buyers will be attracted to the original’s appealing design, premium interior, and surprisingly roomy cabin. There is a downside to the sleek styling, however. The narrow windows may limit visibility and the cargo area is not as roomy as you’d expect from a Land Rover. The Evoque is powered by a respectable 240-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged inline four-cylinder engine – the vehicle’s sole powerplant. The engine is linked to a six-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy is so-so at 20 mpg in city driving and 28 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. And just like a designer outfit, the Evoque comes with a high starting price.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Like Kate Middleton, who can throw an inexpensive sweater over a designer gown and look great, the Range Rover Sport, with its understated British elegance, provides an ideal blend of performance, style, capability, and value. It slots in between the Range Rover Evoque and the full-size Range Rover and gets lots of kudos for its modern interior, great acceleration, and handling, along with its excellent driving position that provides a commanding view of the road. You may need access to the Queen’s treasury, though, when it comes to the gas pump. At its worst, the 2013 Range Rover Sport returns just 12 mpg in city driving and 17 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The Range Rover Sport is equipped with either a 375-horsepower 5.0-liter V-8 engine or a supercharged 510-horsepower V-8 engine linked to a six-speed automatic transmission. It features standard full-time all-wheel drive and a Terrain Response system. Some buyers may object to the firm ride, but the Range Rover Sport should be on your shopping list if you need something to take you from the trail to the country club with ease. However, it’s not cheap, ranging in price from around $60,000 to $86,000.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br/>\n1.

On the plus side, some models – the Mazda 3 comes in sedan or hatchback form– get up to 40 mpg on the highway. If you want to save at the pump, check out the 155-horsepower Skyactiv-G 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. But you’re going to find a bit of a trade-off since the Mazda 3 is relatively expensive. While the base 2013 Mazda 3 starts at just under $16,000, including a $795 destination charge, the top-of-the-line model is priced at $23,695, including shipping. The Mazda 3 is meant for people who don’t think of their car as an appliance and want a sportier look and feel. The compact Mazda doesn’t disappoint in this area, offering five- or six-speed manual transmissions, in addition to a five- or six-speed automatic transmission. The handling is more performance-oriented than you usually find in this class. The interior has good quality materials and there are upscale options, such as a blind spot monitoring system, something that you usually see on luxury cars.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

It was redesigned in 2012 and is so stylish that it won’t even matter if you carry a diaper bag in your daily life. The Mazda 5 is a surprisingly versatile vehicle that can seat up to six people in three rows. On the safety side, all passengers – even those in the rear – are protected by side curtain air bags. On the plus side, the little Japanese minivan offers nimble handling, excellent steering feel, good visibility, and a configurable interior. The second-row captain’s chairs slide, recline, and fold flat, and the third-row seats have a fifty-fifty split so they can be tipped forward to create a flat loading area. It should be noted here that there is limited cargo room in the rear with the seats up. A 157-horsepower 2.5 liter four-cylinder engine is the sole engine available. It is linked to a six-speed manual transmission or a five-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy is so-so at 21 mpg in city driving and 28 mpg on the highway with either transmission, according to the EPA. That’s just a little better than the bigger Chrysler Town & Country minivan, which returns 17 mpg in city driving and 25 mpg on the highway and offers a lot more room.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Virage is clearly related to its older Aston Martin siblings, but it has its own refined exterior styling.  The Virage is the whole package; it will take you to sports car heaven. In the Virage, you’ll find plenty of thoughtful touches including Aston Martin’s staple hand-stitched leather. The engine, a 5.9-liter V-12, has power that’s wedged evenly between the DBS and the DB9. Substantial twenty-inch wheels give the Virage more of a weighty and grounded appearance. Aluminum, carbon fiber, walnut, and Bridge of Weir leather are melded to created a modernist interior. Glass switches and leather-wrapped steering wheel are what makes Aston Martin interiors beautiful. Add to that carbon-disc brakes and a ten-setting adaptive Bilstein suspension. What this translates to is a hot sports car that handles with confidence, class, and style.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Car Guide","caption":"","fileMasterId":41467115,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41467115/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The “Z,” which comes in coupe and convertible models, is designed for driving pleasure and doesn’t disappoint with a stiff suspension, powerful brakes and a throaty engine, but the 2013 models will put a bigger dent in your bank account. The top-of-the-line 2013 Nissan Nismo 370Z starts at $43,800, including shipping, reflecting a $1,360 price increase over the outgoing model. The carryover models get several upgrades including a refreshed front fascia with vertical LED daytime running lights – except on the Nismo 370Z – a new eighteen-inch wheel design for the 370Z Coupe and two new colors – Magma Red and Midnight Blue. The 370Z and 370Z Touring get the standard 332-horsepower 3.7 liter V-6 engine and either a six-speed manual transmission with an optional synchronized downshift rev matching system or a seven-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters. The 2013 Nissan Nismo 370Z gets a 350-horsepower 3.7 liter V-6 engine with a six-speed manual transmission. Be prepared for a stiff ride on public roads, a rather noisy engine, and limited rear visibility.

The available supercharged V-6 engine is capable of going from 0 to 60 mph in a speedy 5.3 seconds. The A6 has a luscious interior, with sleek lines and nice materials. An available navigation system has a Google Earth interface and can be set up as a mobile hotspot for up to eight devices. There is even a touchpad that can read your handwriting, though writing on the nav system with one eye on the road is probably at least as dangerous as texting while driving. Luckily, the A6 also includes lane departure warning, blind spot warning, and Audi Pre-Sense Plus, which will take various safety measures including autonomous braking and seatbelt tightening in the half-second before a collision.

A new grille and projector-style headlights give the Altima a more dramatic face, with LED taillights standard on uplevel models. The Japanese automaker has carried over the 270-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 engine in the Altima, but has revised the 2.5-liter four-cylinder, increasing output from 175 to 182 horsepower. A redesigned Xtronic continuously variable transmission boosts fuel economy in both engines – to 27 mpg in city driving and 38 mpg on the highway on the four-cylinder, according to the EPA. The Altima’s cabin gets dolled up with a new articulated seat design, available in cloth or leather, as well as a new advanced Drive-Assist Display. The Altima offers good handling and a compliant ride. Nissan expanded the Altima range with seven trim levels for 2013.The four-cylinder models get either sixteen-inch steel wheels or seventeen-inch alloy rims, while the six-cylinder models come with eighteen-inch alloys. Available safety technologies are plentiful and include blind spot warning, lane departure warning, and moving object detection.

Audi’s trademark Google Earth map technology is available, as is an excruciatingly pricey Bang & Olufsen stereo.

It offers beefy, all-weather performance, good towing capabilities and a rugged, utilitarian interior. The muscular Armada can tow up to 9,000 pounds and tackle the outdoors, thanks to its truck chassis and low-range four-wheel drive that can handle extreme towing or off-roading needs. A third-row seat is standard and eight passengers can ride comfortably in the spacious Armada. Its standard engine, a 5.6-liter V-8, is rated at 317 horsepower. The engine is linked to a five-speed automatic transmission. But the Armada is thirsty, delivering 12 mpg in city driving and 19 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The Armada, which has a heavy-duty, fully boxed ladder frame, drives like a truck and can be a beast to maneuver into tight parking spaces. Although the interior on the base model feels somewhat cheap, Nissan continues to offer packages that dress up the cabin. For 2013, a new Platinum Reserve package debuts, adding twenty-inch dark chrome wheels, dark chrome grille, and outside mirrors, along with a two-tone Chocolate/Almond leather-trimmed seating with dark satin chrome interior accents. If $4-a-gallon gas prices don’t bother you, the Armada may be a logical choice.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.Toyota Sequoia<br />\n2.

The A8 has long been one of the most balanced, well-proportioned sedans on the market. It carries Audi’s all-wheel drive, and despite being one of the largest sedans in its class, it maintains decent fuel mileage in some models with a highway range falling just short of 30 mpg. The interior of the A8 is quite swanky, with leather seats, wood and aluminum trim, and available extras like Audi’s MMI Google Earth interface and a rear entertainment system. A full-leather option is also available, just in case you want to spend more money on this already very expensive vehicle.

A well behind the rear seats provides decent cargo space and the seats fold forward, but not flat into the floor. The Cube suffers from sluggish acceleration and unsupportive seats, along with numb power steering. The Cube choices are somewhat limited for the new model year, with Nissan deleting the Cube 1.8 base model, Cube 1.8 S Indigo Limited Edition and the Cube Cargo Version. There are now just two models to choose from: the Cube 1.8 S and Cube 1.8 SL. The front-wheel-drive Cube gets a standard 122-horsepower 1.9-liter four-cylinder engine linked to either a six-speed manual transmission or Xtronic continuously variable transmission. The CVT-equipped model returns 27 mpg in city driving and 31 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The fun quotient in the Cube can be increased with the addition of more than forty accessories, including a custom grille, an exterior graphics package and interior design kit with a shag dash topper.

The hybrid will increase the Q5’s already strong gas mileage (20 mpg in the city, 28 mpg on the highway) and add yet more options to the versatile crossovers. Last year’s unsatisfactory V-6 engine will be replaced by a supercharged 272-horsepower option. Buyers can also stick with the previously successful four-cylinder engine.  The Q5 also makes use of Audi’s famous quattro all-wheel drive. A quintessential crossover, the Q5’s exterior avoids the boring trappings of a sedan without looking like a hulking SUV. This design has proved effective in the past, with the Q5 boasting Audi’s second-best sales. In addition to changes to engines, the Q5 has had some improvements to the interior. New aluminum trim options make the inside more attractive, while available Audi Connect technology means the Q5 can access the Internet and connect with Google Maps. Audio controls have also been integrated into the steering wheel for greater convenience.  The new Q5 will also sport Audi’s aggressive and unmistakable new grille and headlight design.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

The base 2013 Nissan GT-R Premium model starts at $97,820, reflecting a $6,870 increase over the outgoing model. The 2013 Nissan GT-R Black Edition starts at $107,320, reflecting an $11,200 price hike. Still, the GT-R is significantly cheaper than some of its chief competition, most notably the Porsche 911 Turbo. The 2013 GT-R gets performance enhancements, including a boost in horsepower from 530 to 545. It is equipped with a 3.8-liter twin-turbo V-6 engine linked to a six-speed automated manual transmission, but it lacks a conventional stick shift. The GT-R stands out with its distinctive good looks, standard adaptive suspension and four-season potential thanks to all-wheel drive. The suspension on the 2013 model has been retuned and the Black Edition gets a new dry carbon fiber spoiler. The new spoiler is handmade in a limited production run. Six exterior colors are available for 2013, including a four-stage metallic Super Silver. The GT-R scores points for its incredible performance, near-telepathic handling, and nice cabin. But it could be more involving and has a harsh, fidgety ride. Putting the GT-R through its paces on public roads may attract the attention of the local constabulary. To experience its true potential, it must be unleashed on a track.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 10","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

With three spacious rows of seats, it can fit up to seven people; with all the seats down, it can fit pretty much anything you can think of. Audi axed a V-8 engine in 2012, and this year they have gone even further toward improving fuel efficiency by offering a new, lighter V-6 diesel engine that is twelve percent more fuel-efficient than previous diesel models, earning an impressive 28 mpg on the highway. The Q7 hasn’t received a major redesign in some years, and its age is showing, but with an updated grille and headlights on the 2013 model, some of that will be mitigated. The design of the interior will remain much the same, but available technology packages could turn the Q7 into your home away from home. The premium packages are rather expensive, but if you’ve got the money, you’re not likely to regret it.

It wins points as a driver’s car, but in the end may be impractical for some families. The Juke – which has been compared to a frog in the looks department – was designed to blend the benefits of a crossover with a sports car. The Juke’s standard turbocharged 1.6-liter inline four-cylinder engine provides 188 horses and punchy acceleration. The engine is linked to either a six-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable transmission that comes with the all-wheel-drive model. A three-mode drive selector – Normal for everyday driving, Sport for a more performance feel and Eco for maximum fuel efficient – gives the driver some interesting choices. Fuel economy is decent. The Juke with the CVT returns 27 mpg in city driving and 32 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The six-speed manual transmission model returns 25 mpg in city driving and 31 mpg on the highway. Tight rear seats and a relatively small cargo hold may limit the Juke’s appeal. The printed fabrics and hard plastic trim in the cabin look a little cheap. The Juke is not for everyone, but it excels with a powerful engine, confidence-inspiring handling, and optional all-wheel drive – and there are eight models to choose from.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7.5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

For comparison, the speedy Audi A8 takes 5.7 seconds to make it from 0 to 60 mph. The R8’s performance is stellar, especially with the satisfying manual transmission. A choice between a V-8 or V-10 engine means there is plenty of power to get your heart racing. Fortunately, Audi has gone to significant lengths to make sure you won’t have to be scraped off the highway. More airbags than you can count and electronic Stability Control come standard, and the R8 has specially constructed crumple zones to protect passengers in the event of a collision. The interior is small, but two passengers can be quite comfortable in their leather sport seats. Drivers can choose between a coupe, an ultra-limited run Spyder, and a convertible. When you consider that the convertible will let you feel the wind in your hair and accelerate a touch faster than the coupe, it’s hard to resist.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 10","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

But the EPA rates the Leaf’s driving range at 73 miles per charge – which makes the little EV impractical for anyone with a long commute. The federal government says there are only 4,466 public charging stations in the U.S., a statistic that may increase “range anxiety” for anyone who owns or is thinking about buying an electric car. Still, the Leaf has a lot going for it. The price is good for an electric car and the Leaf is eligible for federal and state incentives that can help to defray the cost. It drives like a “real” car with sprightly acceleration, zero tailpipe emissions, and a 90-mph top speed. The EPA rates the Leaf at the miles-per-gallon equivalent of 106 in the city and 92 on the highway – the second most fuel-efficient car in America after the Mitsubishi i. The downside is that Leaf home charging can take up to twenty hours without an optional quick charging station. The range can also vary depending on the weather and how much cargo you are carrying. The Leaf suffers from tight rear seats, small cargo space for a hatchback, and confusing cabin technology. But if you have short commutes, have no fear of running out of juice, and want to boost your green credentials, the Leaf may be the way to go.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Sometimes overlooked as just a cute car, the TT is actually fast and well built, and it certainly won’t bore you. The 2012 model year saw the introduction of the very fast RS model (0 to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds), which put an end to complaints that the TT is too precious to perform. Available with either a 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine and manual transmission (the TTRS) or a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, the TT has something for everyone. The TT’s interior is an interesting meld of racing-car-reminiscent shapes and materials with plush elements like sport seats and an optional navigation system. The exterior styling is just about perfect, exactly what you would expect from an Audi sports car. The TT gets more than 30 miles to the gallon on the highway, which might soften some of the sting of spending $50,000 to $60,000 on something so small. The 2013 model won’t see any massive changes, but new colors will join the TT’s palette, and all-leather, two-tone interiors will be available in the S and RS models.

It has tons of power, a comfortable ride, bold exterior styling and an upscale interior. But despite being touted as a sport sedan by the Japanese automaker, its front-wheel-drive layout and continuously variable transmission make it fall short of its lofty goal. Dare we call it a family-friendly sedan without insulting Nissan designers? The five-passenger sedan serves as Nissan’s flagship, but it suffers from a smallish cabin. It is again offered in two models, 3.5 S and 3.5 SV, each powered by a standard 290-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 engine. It returns decent fuel economy at 19 mpg in city driving and 26 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. One downside: the Maxima requires premium gasoline and that can raise your fuel budget compared to other models that get roughly the same ratings. The ride in the Maxima is well damped and comfortable with fairly limited body roll. The sloping roofline in the rear limits headroom for backseat passengers and the high beltline may make smaller passengers feel slightly claustrophobic. The biggest problem with the Maxima, though, may come from the Nissan stable. The less-expensive Nissan Altima sedan received a major makeover for the 2013 model year, which may steer some buyers away from Maxima once they step into a Nissan showroom.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Flying Spur reaches a top speed of 195 mph and the souped-up Spur Speed zooms up to 200 mph, and both do so with considerable grace and nuanced handling. The speed of the Spur in particular defies all logic – it’s a big car with excellent performance statistics. The Mulsanne may have edged it out on the flagship’s prestige category, but the Flying Spur is more than a dignified contender. Lambswool, leather and wood are Bentley calling cards found in the interior. The Flying Spur is twice the price as Mercedes-Benz S Class, but is also twice as refined in more subtle ways. A big engine, all-wheel drive and the extra brawn have their drawbacks at the pump — it gets 10 mpg city and 17 mpg highway. But if you’re Bentley bound, the gas bill probably isn’t your preeminent concern. Bentley has also improved its technology and now features top-of-the line entertainment and navigation.

It’s hard to find a more polarizing ride. Some are intrigued by its droptop fair-weather potential, others gripe that it looks bloated and ridiculous. The Murano CrossCabriolet is plagued by convertible issues like a body that shakes when it goes over bumps since it doesn’t have a solid roof to boost rigidity. It also offers minimal cargo space and has poor rear and side visibility. The unusual convertible gets a power cloth top roof, all-wheel drive and comes in just one model. It is equipped with a 265-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 engine linked to a continuously variable transmission. In a rare twist on a convertible, the CrossCabriolet can tow up to 3,500 pounds. It can be dressed up with optional quilted leather-trimmed seating and comes with twenty-inch five-spoke titanium finish aluminum-alloy wheels. Standard safety features are plentiful and include dual pop-up roll bars for rear passengers. Nissan dropped the price of the CrossCabriolet for the 2012 model year and has not yet announced pricing on the 2013 model. Be prepared to pay more than you would for a conventional Nissan Murano.

The two-door Bentley was refreshed in 2011 followed by the 2012 convertible GTC. Bentley has broadened its engine portfolio, starting with its badass W-12 and now introducing the less thirsty and much thriftier V-8, which manages to pack a wallop of power. Next comes the GT Speed coming in September 2012 that, rumor has it, will be the fastest Bentley ever.

The one downside is that the Murano tends to be a bit expensive. What you get for the money is a pleasing exterior design that remains unchanged for the new model year. A wide chrome-and-mesh grille and triangular headlights prove to be a dramatic combination in the front, while a roof spoiler adds interest in the rear. Nissan beefed up the Murano for 2013 with advanced safety technologies added to the uplevel LE Platinum Edition and SL Navigation Package. The Murano again offers a standard 260-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 linked to an Xtronic CVT. The combination offers smooth, powerful acceleration and returns 18 mpg in city driving and 24 mpg on the highway on the Murano front-wheel-drive model and 18 mpg in city driving and 23 mpg on the highway on the four-wheel-drive model. The ride is comfortable and relatively soft. A long list of options includes a dual panel power moonroof, eight-way power driver’s seat with power lumbar support, and SiriusXM satellite radio. The Murano is an excellent choice for small families who don’t want to sacrifice sensibility for style.

Hang on: you’ll experience the refined grumble of a sophisticated twin-turbo V-8 engine, but there is little noise that can make its way in this well constructed cabin. What you’re paying for in the Bentley is quality, detail and impeccable function.  Patience is part of the ethos of Bentley manufacturing. It takes a 170 hands-on hours to build a Bentley Mulsanne at the factory in Crewe, England. Bentley has added high-tech nuances from the get-go in the Mulsanne model, such as the eight-inch color screen and the sixty-gigabyte hard drive. Here’s where Mulsanne is besting itself with new packages and options for technological splendor. Now you can’t just park a Bentley Mulsanne anywhere, so please travel with an extra stack of $20 spots for the valets.

You get the same menu of engines and transmissions as in the 3-series, but the 1’s overall lighter weight makes for exhilarating performance. The trade-off is that the only models available are the coupe and convertible. Life with a two-door compact can be a struggle, as when you’re hurrying to expel passengers at the airport. (By then, they’ll be overjoyed to get out of the cramped back seat.) But if rear passengers would be a rarity and driving thrills are your pursuit, the 1-series offers its own rewards. The 128i comes with a 3.0-liter 230-horsepower six-cylinder and the choice of a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. The turbocharged 135i slightly revises the six to blast off with 300 horsepower; that six-speed manual is standard, but an enthusiastic driver might prefer the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic’s legerdemain.

The biggest knock against the outgoing model is that it was an old-fashioned SUV that was less refined than its rivals. The Pathfinder has shed its old V-8 engine, along with 500 pounds, and now returns 26 mpg on the highway. The 2013 Nissan Pathfinder FWD tips the scales at 4,149 pounds; in comparison, the lightest 2013 Ford Explorer weighs 4,448 pounds. The changes should translate to a more carlike ride. Although official pricing hasn’t been announced, Nissan says the Pathfinder is in line for a price cut and would start at less than $30,000. All 2013 Pathfinders now come equipped with a 260-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 engine mated with a next-generation Xtronic continuously variable transmission. The 2013 Pathfinder will be offered in 4x4 and 4x2 configurations and in four models – S, SV, SL and Platinum. It has a standard towing capacity of 5,000 pounds, significantly less than the outgoing model. The seven-passenger Pathfinder has more cabin space than the previous model. Options include a heated steering wheel, thirteen-speaker Bose Premium Audio system, dual-zone climate control, and remote engine start. Parents will love the new Latch and Glide system in the Pathfinder.

That means it’s even more fun to drive, sleeker and more pleasing to look at, more luxurious, and better-equipped. As usual, what’s under the hood is excellent: the 300-horsepower 3.0-liter six-cylinder is included with the 335i. But the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder in the 328i won’t disappoint anyone with 240 horsepower and greater frugality. There’s also the option of the six-speed manual transmission or a new eight-speed automatic. Equipped with the automatic transmission, the 328i gets 36 mpg highway and the 335i gets 33 mpg highway. Not bad! The forthcoming ActiveHybrid 3, which adds a turbocharger to the six-cylinder and combines its output with assist from an electric motor, promises an improvement in fuel efficiency without sacrificing sportiness. The 335is coupe and convertible make 320 horsepower with the six-cylinder, adding a performance edge.

The Japanese minivan holds up well against its competitors and merits a second look by anyone needing a family-friendly ride. The cabin in a minivan counts more than its exterior looks and the Quest does not disappoint in this area. It features one-touch, power sliding doors, quick release fold-flat second and third row seats and a useful rear storage well. The step-in height is lower than on other minivans, making it easier to get passengers in and out. The Quest gets a 260-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6 engine linked to an Xtronic continuously variable transmission. Fuel economy is decent at 19 mpg in city driving and 25 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The Quest can be loaded up with lots of options designed to keep fussy kids happy, including an eleven-inch rear DVD video screen, Bose audio system and dual moonroofs that slide open. A total of six cupholders and six bottle holders are standard, along with four coat hangers and two 12-volt DC outlets. The dual-level front center console offers flexible storage, as does the removable second row console. An overhead front console is standard on SL and LE models.

Or, you can settle for the 300-horsepower version of the turbo six-cylinder from the 535i sedan--not brutally fast but still pretty quick. Among the sedan entries, there’s also the 528i. Remarkably for this class and price range, the 528i goes about its business with a turbo four-cylinder. Then there’s the ActiveHybrid 5, in which the turbo six is assisted by an electric motor, their output going through an eight-speed transmission. As quick as it can be, the ActiveHybrid 5 can also creep along solely on battery power for 2.5 miles. Ask your neighbor if his Blutomobile can do that! Efficiency is spreading across the 5-series range, too, thanks to the automatic stop/start, which completely shuts off the engine while you sit at intersections, then restarts it when you release the brake.

The 2013 Nissan Sentra gets a more sophisticated look courtesy of a redesign that includes upscale touches such as LED-accented headlights and taillights. The high-performance – and thirsty -- Nissan Sentra SE-R and SE-R Spec V have been eliminated from the lineup. The 2013 Sentra gets a new 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 130 horsepower. The engine is linked to a continuously variable transmission or six-speed manual transmission. It is the only engine in the Sentra lineup. The EPA has yet to list official fuel-economy numbers for the redesigned Sentra, but Nissan says the 2013 Sentra FE+ models will deliver 40 mpg on the highway. The base 2013 Sentra returns 30 mpg in city driving and 39 mpg on the highway. Nissan says the changes to the Sentra result in a “13 percent improvement in EPA combined fuel economy.” The Sentra is 150 pounds lighter than the outgoing model. The compact sedan gets a soft-touch instrument panel, optional leather-trimmed seats and maple wood-tone trim. A new version of the Nissan navigation system is an option. With gasoline prices hovering near the $4-a-gallon mark all year, the revisions to the Sentra should be a welcome change to anyone reeling from pump prices.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong> <br />\n1.

As before, the series offers a turbocharged six-cylinder in the 740i and long-wheelbase 740Li. This six is also included in the ActiveHybrid 7, whereas a V-8 had been offered. All 750 models, including those with all-wheel drive à la the 740Li, have turbo V-8s. Meanwhile, sitting on its throne, the range-topping 760Li could hardly be modest about its turbo V-12 producing 536 horsepower. On the tech side, LED headlights that produce a “natural daylight” type of high-contrast light are standard on the 760Li and optional on other models. The same 16-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system that’s offered in the 6-series is available here, too. And the incorporation of 3-D into the navigation display makes the animation better and the displays more dynamic. The system also incorporates mobile-office functions with speech-to-text capability.

But with the new model year, the Japanese truck falls farther behind its American competition, especially in terms of engine offerings and fuel economy. The Titan gets just one engine, a standard 317-horsepower 5.6-liter V-8 linked to a standard five-speed automatic transmission, and no V-6 engine. This in an era when the 2013 Ford F-150 rolls out a restyled model with a range of engine choices, including a 302-horsepower 3.7-liter V-6 and a 365-horsepower 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6. All F-150s get the more modern six-speed automatic transmission as well. The Titan lags well behind the competition in terms of fuel economy, with the two-wheel-drive version returning just 13 mpg in city driving and 18 mpg on the highway according to the EPA. There is no regular cab version of the Titan either. On the plus side, the PRO-4X Titan gets a mini-makeover for the new model year, with revised graphics, satin chrome grille, dark wheel finish, and a revised interior look. The Titan gets kudos for its macho styling, strong V-8, and good brakes, but it still is a dark horse when compared to its rivals from Detroit that seem better able to keep pace with the constant changes in the truck market.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7.5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

That ought to put a smile on the face of anyone who takes satisfaction in doing more with less. Meanwhile, the X3 35i uses a 3.0-liter six-cylinder, and the output is 300 horsepower. An eight-speed automatic is the only transmission in the X3 range. Driving Dynamics Control allows you to select either of two sport modes, which regulate variability in steering effort, transmission shift points, and the vigilance of the stability control system, but the result is a jumpy, nervous vehicle that shifts gears frenetically. The normal mode is fine. A good thing about DDC, though, is the Eco Pro mode that monitors all onboard mechanical systems and electrical functions for efficiency. It even relays tactful suggestions about your lead-footed style of driving, if this is warranted.

Seriously, Dodge’s charismatic muscle car could be the best wing man (or wing woman) ever in terms of helping shy folks make friends. Despite receiving few updates over the years, the Challenger’s square-jawed styling is as fetching now as ever, with the new Rallye Redline package making even the base model look like a badass. The base Challenger is sort of badass, actually, with 305 horsepower available from its 3.5-liter V-6. Upgrade to the 375-horsepower R/T model to get more power and a pistol-grip manual shifter, or if you simply want to say yes when someone asks you, \"That thing got a Hemi?\" True horsepower addicts will love the 470-horsepower SRT8, which also happens to come with clever Track Apps that record acceleration, cornering, and braking performance to confirm that, yes, indeed, it really is fast. \n\nRegardless of what’s under the hood, the Challenger is built using the same big bones as the full-size Charger sedan, making it the only muscle car with five seatbelts. Also, despite its reverently retrospective styling and its intense interior ambiance, the Challenger offers countless luxury and convenience features, including an integrated Garmin-based navigation system, heated leather seats, and, on SRT8 models, an eighteen-speaker sound system with 900 watts that shouldn't have any problem drowning out the intoxicating exhaust note.

What other car, besides its corporate cousin the Chrysler 300, can be the perfect family car by day and star in rap videos by night? With rear-wheel drive or on-demand all-wheel drive, the Charger has also become the darling of law enforcement, if that means anything to you (just don’t expect it to get you out of any speeding tickets, trust us). Still, there are many reasons it can wear so many hats. First, it looks great, with a menacing stare and many Mopar accessories available to help you customize it to your liking (the Blacktop package is particularly hot, we think). It also has some chops, with a base V-6 making 292 horsepower, mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission that helps the big girl achieve 31 mpg on the highway. Spring for the 370-horsepower V-8 and it becomes downright fast, and for speed demons, a scary-looking 470-horsepower SRT-8 model is pure hooligan heaven. Finally, the Charger has a value story to tell, with base models starting under $26,000 (less than a V-6-equipped Toyota Camry), and dashboard trim rendered in real aluminum. Optional are sport seats, a simple Garmin-based navigation/infotainment system using a huge 8.4-inch screen, and even a Beats by Dr. Dre sound system.

Why bring this up? Because the 2013 Dodge Dart is the first new vehicle developed under Fiat’s stewardship for any of its new family of American brands, and not only does it fill a gaping hole in the Dodge lineup, it does so with real swagger. Despite being half Italian, the Dart exudes plenty of American style. Its proportions are European, but its unbroken strip of LED taillights spanning the trunk, à la the Charger, as well as the aggressive headlamp and grille treatment, are purely American. A choice of three four-cylinder engines (ranging from 160 to 184 horsepower) and three transmissions (including a conventional manual) furnish the engine bay, any combination of which should help keep one’s fuel bill manageable, though no Dart iteration achieves the magic 40 mpg fuel economy figure that has become the gold standard among compact cars. Inside the Dart, its somewhat 1990s-esque architecture detracts little from its generally pleasant ambience, and its calling cards include its availability in many flavors, each with smart ergonomics, and a huge back seat. Prices for its five available trim levels, which start under $17K and run into above $23K for the performance-oriented R/T model, are competitive compared to other compact cars.

The Z4 is the only entry in BMW’s lineup in which all-wheel drive is not available because driven rear wheels remain the preferred configuration for sports cars. The Z4 has a long nose and bold styling, which is most evident in the way the character line flows off the front fender and bridges with the rear one.

Moderately restyled for 2013, the Enclave is offered in both front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive versions, and in Convenience, Leather, and Premium trim levels. All have a V-6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission that yield 24 mpg on the highway for the front-wheel-drive model. The four-wheel-drive model does slightly less, with 22 mpg on the highway. The three rows really do accommodate three rows of full-size passengers, but in consequence, there’s less luggage space in the back than might be desired, at a maximum of 23.3 cubic feet if you leave all rows of seats in place. Safety features include a front center side air bag, which Buick notes is an industry first, and a standard rear-vision camera. A power liftgate and remote start are both standard. Luxury add-ons abound, including a premium audio system, color-touch radio with DVD and navigation plus a seven-inch touchscreen, an eight-way passenger’s seat adjuster, and choccochino and cocoa leather color combinations for the interior.  The chrome accents are real, the stitching on the door trim and interior is real, and so is Buick’s commitment to the upscale family buyer.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><del></del><br />\n1.

Then came a slew of three-row crossovers from its competitors, and the Durango had no choice but to evolve. Evolve it did, and after becoming a crossover itself two years ago, people liked it. The Durango has found many happy homes ever since. It is more powerful and more capable, thanks to a strong 290- to 295-horsepower V-6 (depending on model) and an even stronger available 360-horsepower Hemi V-8. Like its predecessor, it comes with rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, but unlike before, today’s Durango is smooth and stable on the road, not bumpy and tippy. It has more usable space in its refined interior, seating six or seven people, with thirty storage spaces and, with the seats folded, room for a six-foot couch. And of course, it is dashingly good-looking. Since it's available in base SXT, nicely equipped Crew, sporty Hemi-powered R/T, and formal Citadel trim levels, selecting a Durango may be somewhat hard. That's especially true because of the newly available Rallye Appearance group that helps the SXT models look like an R/T, and the Premium Leather package that brings red-stitched, super-soft leather to the R/T. If there are bones to pick, it’s that fuel economy is less than amazing, and prices can creep pretty high with all the option boxes checked. That said, 2013 prices have dropped for some models will help this automotive fairy tale keep its happy ending.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Yeah, it’s not often that the words “minivan” and “fun to drive” are used in the same sentence, but in this case—and that of the GC’s Chrysler-branded twin, the Town & Country—it’s the surprising reality. Credit thorough re-engineering for 2011 that banished the sloppy handling and gooey steering usually associated with such domesticated vehicles. Less surprising is the way it accommodates families with up to seven members and all of their attendant accoutrements. In addition to the abundant space, kid stuff—and the second- or third-row seats themselves—may be stowed (with one-handed operation) in deep reservoirs in the floor of most models. The GC comes in five flavors: AVP, SE, SXT, Crew, and R/T, the first two priced very aggressively (the AVP starts under $21,000), and the latter three featuring the highest amount of popular equipment. Our favorite is the R/T model (which Dodge has lightheartedly referred to as the “man van,” with its monochromatic paint, a tighter suspension, seventeen-inch satin carbon wheels, black leather upholstery, red stitching, and a whomping sound system. All Grand Caravans are powered by the same meaty 283-horsepower V-6 mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Compared with the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna, the Grand Caravan may be a tad smaller, but it is tons more fun.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

A three-row, up-to-seven-passenger crossover made from the rib of the chunky, plasticky Avenger sedan back in 2007, the Journey didn’t stand a chance from the beginning. A thorough revamp, however, in 2011 brought with it tidier handling and a vastly improved interior, including one particularly cool white-on-black upholstery treatment offset by orange stitching. What the Journey did not get was dramatically different styling, which would have helped it lure people away from more established crossovers like the Ford Edge, Honda Crosstour, and Hyundai Santa Fe, to name a few. And so the Journey continues to struggle in spite of Dodge having groomed it into a reasonably nice tall wagon/small minivan. It is available in five trim levels, with top-tier Crew and R/T models (the latter being the “sporty” one) offering a legitimately luxurious driving experience. The steering is communicative, and the thrust from the available 283-horsepower V-6 is outstanding, even with optional all-wheel drive. And we love how its second-row under-floor bins hold chilled soda cans or muddy shoes. Best of all, it is one of the most aggressively priced crossovers around, with most 2013 trim levels priced lower than in 2012, starting at under $20,000 for the AVP and the range-topping R/T model starting at just under $30K. Is that enough to get consumers’ attention this year? Probably not, but it is a respectable value for those who notice.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The brand-new Encore is a Continental take on the crossover utility vehicle. It is built on the same platform as GM’s Europe-market Opel Corsa, meaning it is small. Really small: 168.5 inches long, shorter than a Honda Civic and very close to the same size as the compact Audi A3 hatchback. In fact, Buick is going after the same kinds of buyers who look at Audi’s A3. The Encore is a front-wheel-drive vehicle with a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, and an all-wheel-drive model is available. The interior is similar to those in other current Buicks such as the Verano sedan, with a center instrument panel featuring Buick’s voice-activated IntelliLink system and its seven-inch color display screen, as well as blue ambient lighting. The Encore is loaded with safety equipment and electronics, including ten airbags, traction control, remote start, Bose premium audio, and a heated, leather-covered steering wheel. Options include a backup camera and front and rear parking sensors. Active noise cancellation and heavy use of sound-dampening technology such as an acoustically treated headliner should get this small vehicle closer to the serene feeling one expects from a Buick. Time will tell if American buyers will flock to this five-passenger crossover; it goes on sale in the U.S. in early 2013.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Interestingly, though, the Buick LaCrosse is aimed just as much at buyers in China as those in the United States. Logical, since Buicks are actually bigger sellers there. A benefit of that market strategy is that rear-seat room is generous in the LaCrosse, because chauffeurs often drive this type of car in China. If you plan to do your own driving, you have two choices of engine. There’s a mild hybrid four-cylinder—meaning the engine is supplemented by an electric motor and a lithium-ion battery that improve fuel economy but don’t power the car by themselves. With that engine choice, fuel economy is an impressive 36 mpg on the highway. Who would expect that number from a sedan this size? The other engine is a V-6, required if you want the full-time all-wheel-drive version of the LaCrosse. Rear park assist, blind spot alert, and thorax air bags for the rear seat are all options. New for 2013, IntelliLink is standard on all models; it connects your smartphone to an eight-inch touchscreen display and lets you stream music through your phone from Pandora and other Internet-based services.

The 2013 Santa Fe has a more sculpted look and standard chrome exterior touches. Families will appreciate the flexible seating arrangements and the attention to safety features, including seven standard air bags. There are lots more extras, too, including such options as a panoramic sunroof, push-button start, heated steering wheel, and a second-row seat that slides.

You may see this mid-size sedan as serviceable but uninteresting. But what about the Turbo, which gives you 270 horsepower worth of driving interest? Then there’s the eAssist mild hybrid model, which gives you 36 mpg on the highway thanks to its lithium-ion battery and electric motor that work together to power regenerative braking and save fuel. Did we mention that Buick’s IntelliLink is standard on all models? That system hooks up your smartphone and other mobile devices, lets you customize programming, and allows streaming audio from your phone via Pandora or other Internet services. Last but not least, consider that the Regal is based on the European Opel Insignia, and you might find yourself looking at this Buick in a different light.  Traction control, foglamps, leather-trimmed seating, heated front seats, ice blue ambient lighting, and a seven-inch touchscreen are all standard on every model. The GS turbo model has special tuning, including a modified front suspension, but no all-wheel-drive option. GS models have an interactive drive control system with standard, sport, tour, and enthusiast-oriented GS settings; it’s optional on the turbo. A set of twenty-inch polished alloy wheels is optional on GS models, too. All of that helps explain why the Regal is the core of Buick's product line.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The base 2013 Hyundai Tucson GL starts at $20,070, including an $825 destination charge. Hyundai has been steadily moving upmarket with all of its vehicles lately – but the good news is that Tucson is still significantly cheaper than most of its Japanese competition, including the Honda CR-V. The 2013 Tucson gets some modest upgrades, including heated front seats on the GLS FWD model, a proximity key entry with push-button start on the Limited trim, foglights, and automatic headlight control on the GLS. The Tucson is also a stellar performer at the fuel pump. The Tucson GLS with a 176-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine and six-speed automatic transmission returns 22 mpg in city driving and 32 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The Tucson also gets high marks for its agile handling and responsive steering. The Tucson can be ordered with an all-wheel-drive system. The 2013 Tucson with AWD features hill start assist control and downhill brake control, two features typically found on luxury SUVs. Families will appreciate the amenities, too, including nineteen different storages places and drink holders in the cabin.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Gone is the EX35 model and in its place is the EX37. Infiniti says the rear-wheel-drive model returns 17 mpg in city driving and 25 mpg on the highway. The EX37 is getting a little long in the tooth and is due for a major revision. Despite that, the midsize luxury crossover that seats five still manages to convey a sense of high style. The crossover, which also can be ordered in all-wheel-drive configuration, earns kudos for its acceleration and handling. Front-seat passengers are coddled, but back-seat passengers may feel like second-class citizens. It’s just plain cramped back there, plus there is limited cargo room in the rear. Standard features are plentiful and include leather-trimmed seats, a smart key with push-button start, and eight-spoke eighteen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. But it’s a mystery why upscale Infiniti charges extra for an optional driver’s seat headrest coat hanger and the better audio systems. There’s lots of useful technology as well, but be prepared to pay extra for it. Those options include a blind spot warning system, lane departure prevention system, intelligent cruise control, and intelligent brake assist with forward collision warning. The 2013 EX starts at $37,300, including an $950 destination charge, making it $2,645 cheaper than a base 2013 BMW X3. But keep in mind that the optional premium package on the EX37 adds another $3,050 to the bottom line, while the tech package costs $2,750.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

It’s aimed at buyers who might consider an Audi or a Volvo, offering them a cheaper domestic alternative. The Verano is slightly larger and has more powerful engines than the Cruze—its engines are sourced from Buick’s larger Regal—and it also has premium touches such as wood trim, a center-stack dashboard with standard IntelliLink, and a rearview camera as standard. A heated steering wheel, leather interior, and a power sunroof are all available. New for 2013, there’s a turbocharged four-cylinder engine. This model offers 250 horsepower while providing 31 mpg on the highway, only a 1-mpg penalty over the standard engine, for the Verano with the six-speed manual transmission that’s a no-cost option. Mileage figures for the turbo Verano with automatic transmission aren’t out yet. This sedan nominally seats five but would be more comfortable for four. Another less than comfortable feature is the overly busy front end. It features a set of portholes that, although a traditional Buick design cue, are out of place on this small car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The ride quality in the FX line may be a bit too harsh for commuters and the school carpool as well. Still, performance is top notch with the base FX37 model getting a new standard 325-horsepower 3.7-liter V-6 engine. Rear-wheel drive is standard on the base model and all-wheel drive is optional. The top-of-the-line FX50 with all-wheel drive gets a beefy 390-horsepower 5.0-liter V-8 engine. Both engines are linked to a standard seven-speed automatic transmission. Both models have double-wishbone front and multilink rear suspensions and large four-wheel disc brakes. The cabin is richly appointed and there are lots of extras like optional sport seats that hold the passengers in place during hard cornering and make the driver feel like she’s Danica Patrick. Solid magnesium paddle shifters are optional and enhance the FX’s performance-oriented personality. The FX line may not be the best choice for hauling your kids and pets, but it does have one unusual accessory that would be perfect for sleepovers: a “hatch tent” that converts the cargo area into a sleeping area.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Infiniti G37 Coupe base model is no longer available. There are now only three models in the G sedan lineup: the G37 Sedan Journey, G37 Sedan Sport 6MT, and G37x Sedan AWD.

All Gs now get a standard 328-horsepower 3.7-liter V-6 engine mated to either a seven-speed automatic transmission or a six-speed manual transmission. The G convertible is our least favorite of the body styles because the retractable hard top can squeak and creak on all but the smoothest roads. The G gets high marks for good handling, user-friendly controls, and attractive cabin materials.

The main gripe against the IPLs is that they are overpriced. The IPL G Convertible starts at $61,495, including an $895 destination charge, making it $8,600 more expensive than the base 2013 Infiniti G37 convertible. The IPL G Convertible is equipped with a 343-horsepower 3.7-liter V-6, seven-speed automatic transmission, IPL-tuned exhaust and suspension, nineteen-inch special wheels, and a three-piece retractable hardtop. Surprisingly, the exterior color choices on the new convertible are limited to just two: Malbec Black or Moonlight White. The droptop can be dolled up with extras like the $360 Midnight Black grille and $340 illuminated kick plates. A $545 rear wind deflector is a practical option, especially if you’re worried about your hair. Standard features include leather-trimmed seating and antilock brakes. The IPL G Coupe comes in two models, one with a seven-speed automatic transmission and another with a six-speed manual transmission. The IPL G Coupe gets a different look than its G sibling thanks to a different front and rear bumper design, sculpted side sills, a rear spoiler, and fancy nineteen-inch wheels. The pricing on the 2013 IPL G Convertible is designed to fall in between some of its toughest German competition.
