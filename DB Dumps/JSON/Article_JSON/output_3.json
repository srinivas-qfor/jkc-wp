The less expensive of the two Lambos on the market, it comes around $200,000, roughly the price of a starter home in a nice neighborhood. Slower and far subtler than the Lamborghini Aventador, it still tops out just above 200 mph and has unmistakable supercar looks. In a machine like this, everything comes second to power. The Gallardo doesn’t disappoint, offering a choice of a 550-, 560-, or 570-horsepower engine. The 570-horse version takes the Gallardo from 0 to 62 mph in less than four seconds and 0 to 124 mph in about 10 seconds. Some models are available with all-wheel drive to help keep control of the car at high speeds. The Gallardo seats two, and is available as a convertible with a soft top. Compared to its stunning performance, the interior is rarely the selling point on a Lamborghini, but that doesn’t mean it falls short. With leather seats, available two-tone or monotone, available accents like a suede steering wheel, and an available navigation system (albeit, a very expensive one), you will be plenty comfortable while zooming past plebs in their sedans.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 10","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

The Crossover is the only SX4 that comes with all-wheel drive; if you go with one of the other models, you’ll have to settle for front-wheel drive. The car’s 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine will get you up to 29 miles city and 33 miles highway on a single tank of gas. However, given the size of this car as compared to some of its competitors, the mileage should be better. The upside is that many features that come in expensive comfort and convenience packages on other cars come standard on the SX4. On most trim levels, you’ll find your SX4 equipped with illuminated steering wheel controls, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with cruise control buttons and audio controls, and a remote keyless entry system.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tFord Fiesta<br />\n2.\tHonda Fit<br />\n3.\tNissan Versa<br />\n4.\tScion xD<br />","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items: </strong><br />\n1.\tIlluminated steering wheel controls.<br />\n2.\tAir filtering system.<br />","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks: </strong><br />\n1.\tKabuki-inspired headlamps. <br />\n2.\tWheel arch protection molding.<br />\n3.\tBody-colored mirrors and door handles.<br />","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585478,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585478/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>New for 2013: </strong><br />\n1.

Options include a touchscreen navigation system, a backup camera, and iPod and MP3 connectivity. The area behind the front row can be configured to hold two seats, but the Evora still wouldn’t quite count as a four-seater, earning a 2+2 designation instead. Don’t let that deter you if you’ve got a young family, though. The available back seat comes equipped to handle child seats. If you’re not enticed by a tight squeeze in the back seat, that area can turn into a low bench instead, perfect for hauling shopping bags (though maybe not groceries for five). It gets good gas mileage for a sports car, making almost 30 mpg on the highway, but even the base model is more expensive than most competitors.

Since then, the Kizashi hasn’t undergone many changes and, like its siblings the Grand Vitara and the Equator, exists under the average buyer’s radar despite sales promotions that can reduce the price of the car by $3,000. With a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, the Kizashi has a fuel economy of up to 23 mpg city and 30 mpg highway, making it great for those with long, cross-town commutes. Since long rides can be less than stimulating for the driver, Suzuki offers a Rockford ten-speaker sound system and heated leather seats on the Kizashi Sport SLS, which also allows you to stream music from your iPod via Bluetooth if the AM/FM radio doesn’t hold your interest. Long drives to and from work can also be hard on your car, but they shouldn’t be a problem with the Kizashi; this car held up after driving at top speeds on the Autobahn and rolling over cobblestone roads in England.

The interior is luxuriously appointed in leather – available in ten colors ranging from beige to bright red or deep blue – with chrome accents and a standard Bose Surround Sound audio system. The GranTurismo’s V-8 engine was engineered by Ferrari, so it should be plenty loud and fast enough to keep drivers happy.

The McLaren’s presence is not quite as striking as a Ferrari’s or Lamborghini’s, with its less aggressive front end and more refined rear. It does feature jackknife doors for a bit of fun, and benefits from sleek, futuristic carbon fiber accents throughout. McLaren will offer a new hardtop convertible Spider model for 2013. The Spider’s top can raise and lower at the touch of a button even while the car is moving. The interior is perfectly suited to the car, with carbon fiber accents, a minimalist center console, and well-designed racing seats with color-contrasting accents. The MP4-12C is the elder statesman to Ferrari’s boisterous man-child, but that doesn’t mean it won’t knock your socks off.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-meter:</strong> 10","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

If you drive a Suzuki motorcycle or have a Suzuki outboard motor on your boat, you can transport them using a Suzuki-brand truck. The super-practical 2013 Equator has a towing capacity of up to 6,300 pounds, meaning that you should have little or no trouble pulling your boat out of storage and putting it in the water just before fishing season begins. In addition to this, both the Extended and Crew Cab body styles have flip-up rear seats, fold-down passenger seats, and storage boxes for moving smaller things that either can’t or shouldn’t be hitched to the back of a truck. Suzuki believes in providing its customers with options, so in addition to your choice of cab body styles, you also have the choice of a long or short bed for your Equator, as well as a five-speed manual or automatic transmission. However, keep in mind, stick-shift aficionados, that the manual is only available with the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. The automatic only comes with the V-6. For your driving convenience, this pickup truck also features heated leather seats and a sunroof for those sunny but bitter cold winter days.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 3","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors: </strong><br />\n1.\tChevrolet Colorado<br />\n2.\tGMC Canyon<br />\n3.\tHonda Ridgeline<br />\n4.\tNissan Frontier","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items:</strong><br />\n1.\tDual power mirrors.<br />\n2.\tFront reading lamp.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks: </strong><br />\n1.\tChrome rear bumper and front grille.<br />\n2.\tUV cut glass and privacy glass.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585478,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585478/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>New for 2013: </strong><br />\n1.\tThree new exterior colors.<br />\n2.\tLarger headrests.<br />\n3.\tElectronic stability control available on all models.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":13305,"make":"Suzuki","model":"Equator","year":0},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"8bfe9141-264d-3530-adde-b612c376b580","type":"mediaTag","name":"Trucks","path":"/Main/Trucks"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":12},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:03:35.656-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865415657 }} },{ "_id":222672,"title":"2013 Mercedes-Benz C-Class","subTitle":"Whether it’s sedan or coupe, the C-Class combines refinement, luxury, and performance.","slug":"2013-mercedes-benz-c-class","promoTitle":"2013 Mercedes-Benz C-Class","promoTeaserSmall":"2013 Mercedes-Benz C-Class","promoTeaser":"2013 Mercedes-Benz C-Class","keywords":["2013 Mercedes-Benz C-Class"],"metaTitle":"2013 Mercedes-Benz C-Class Buyer's Guide -

The standard “mbrace” suite of telematics features now provides Internet access, and you can use mbrace2 and your smartphone to keep the valet from joyriding during your hot-stone massage.

The 3.5-liter V-6 with direct injection and automatic start/stop, which is available in the all-wheel-drive C300 sedan, is a great choice. On the other hand, the rockin’ C63 AMG has a 6.2-liter V-8 that puts out 451 horsepower and takes no prisoners. A seven-speed automatic is included with every C-Class model. Sport sedans--notice that we’re pushing sport--have a flat-bottomed steering wheel and heartbreakingly beautiful ash wood trim. You’ll kick yourself for getting the floormats dirty.

The XV Crosstrek has rugged capability and Subaru’s all-wheel drive system to tackle any recreational sport or task, while not losing any of those interior comforts you have grown to want. The XV Crosstrek offers rear seat legroom close to that of a mid-size vehicle. If you want to feel good about saving the environment while driving, this is the car for you. The XV Crosstrek is built in a zero landfill plant and is a partial zero emissions vehicle. You’ll also feel good getting close to 33 MPG with the larger gas tank. The XV Crosstrek comes with two transmission choices: a five-speed manual transmission and an automatic with manual control mode and steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters. The XV Crosstrek will keep you and your occupants safe, coming standard with Subaru’s advanced frontal airbag system. This system is equipped with airbags that can sense how close you are to the airbag. The XV Crosstrek is proof you can have a rugged vehicle without having to surrender comfort and gas mileage.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

With the base turbocharged 4.6-liter V-8 making 429 horsepower, the CL550 will perform as well as a sports car on a challenging road. A larger and even more powerful V-8 in the CL63 AMG is the favorite among four engines offered, although buyers might disagree and choose either of the two turbocharged V-12 powerplants. The larger, 6.0-liter one affords you the opportunity to play with 621 horsepower. Five- or seven-speed automatic transmissions are offered. If you’re planning on snowy winters, you should keep in mind that the CL550 is the only all-wheel-drive model. The exterior design is highlighted by pillarless construction that leaves an undefiled sweep of side glass. Body colors are subdued and dignified. Besides being exquisitely beautiful inside, the car is loaded with amenities. Heated and ventilated front seats offer a massaging capability, for example. Every conceivable active safety system is available, helping the driver to stay awake, see their blind spots, distinguish pedestrians at night, and keep the car in its lane.

It’s unfortunate, because the Tribeca is a pretty well-appointed car. As with all Subarus, it comes standard with all-wheel drive and has a passenger volume similar to its more popular sibling. Like the Outback, it’s also good for hauling any sort of equipment that you find yourself transporting; the Tribeca has a cargo area under the rear floors in addition to flat folding second- and third-row seats. The up-to-date audio system and a rear-seat entertainment system will keep both you and your little passengers entertained. Heated front seats come standard for your driving comfort and an auxiliary air conditioning system to keep all your backseat passengers cool on hot, sunny days.

Subaru’s 2013 Outback, the world’s original crossover vehicle, offers its passengers all of the capabilities of an SUV with the stability of a sedan, making it an excellent car for both short trips to school or the market and longer family road trips. Featuring an estimated fuel economy of up to 30 mpg highway and a super-quiet ride, you’re not very likely to find a better deal for $24,000-$32,000 amongst the Outback’s competitors.  If you’re the outdoorsy or sporty type, you’ll be particularly taken with the 71.3 cubic feet of cargo space and the adjustable rear roof crossbar, which will allow you to cart a variety of bulky sporting gear with you on your adventures or at least ensure that you have enough room to transport the majority, if not all, of your daughter’s belongings to college without having to leave her behind! The Outback also makes certain that all your trips to campus are safe ones thanks to Subaru’s new EyeSight system, which will activate the breaks before a collision and a stereo camera that will let you see the obstacles in your path before you feel them.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors: </strong><br />\n1.\tFord Escape<br />\n2.\tGMC Terrain<br />\n3.\tJeep Liberty<br />\n4.\tToyota Highlander","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items:</strong><br />\n1.\tEyeSight driver assist system.<br />\n2.\tHarman/Kardon audio system (on the Premium model).","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks: </strong><br />\n1.\tGround clearance of 8.7 inches. <br />\n2.\tRedesigned grille, headlights, and bumper cover.<br/>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585478,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585478/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":33,"text":"<strong>New for 2013:</strong><br />\n1.\tNew engine with more power.<br />\n2.\tBluetooth steering wheel control switches.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"Wagons","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20437,"make":"Subaru","model":"Outback","year":2013},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":9},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:03:38.700-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865418701 }} },{ "_id":222678,"title":"2013 Subaru Legacy","subTitle":"A neglected star in the mid-size firmament, the Legacy stands head and shoulders above the competition.","slug":"2013-subaru-legacy","promoTitle":"2013 Subaru Legacy","promoTeaserSmall":"2013 Subaru Legacy","promoTeaser":"2013 Subaru Legacy","keywords":["2013 Subaru Legacy"],"metaTitle":"2013 Subaru Legacy  Buyer's Guide -

Well, don’t make a decision just yet. The Subaru Legacy has been a solid performer since it’s redesign in 2010 and will continue to be with its new changes for 2013. Under the hood of the 2.5i, you’ll find the brand-new, 2.5 liter Boxer engine which achieves up to 32 mpg highway with standard all-wheel drive, making the Legacy the most fuel-efficient sedan on the American market. One of the great things about mid-size sedans is that they accommodate both the short and the tall comfortably, but the Legacy is roomier than most, boasting 103 cubic feet in passenger volume. However, more car can sometimes mean reduced visibility. That is remedied with the new EyeSight driver-assist. Not only does this system provide you with lane departure warnings and identify obstacles in traffic, but EyeSight can activate the brakes to avoid collision. So before you decide to put a hard-earned down payment on a Fusion or a Camry, take some time to look at the safer, sportier 2013 Legacy.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors: </strong><br />\n1.\tFord Fusion<br />\n2.\tToyota Camry<br />\n3.\tHonda Accord<br />\n4.\tVolkswagen Passat","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items: </strong><br />\n1.\tEyeSight driver assist system.<br />\n2.\tBluetooth hands-free phone capability.<br />\n3.\tHill holder system.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks: </strong><br />\n1.\tRedesigned front for a sportier look.<br />\n2.\tBody-color side mirrors.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585478,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585478/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>New for 2013: </strong><br />\n1.\tBrake override system.<br />\n2.\tEyeSight driver assist system.<br />\n3.\tSecond-generation Lineatronic continuously variable transmission.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"Sedans","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20438,"make":"Subaru","model":"Legacy","year":2013},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":7},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:03:39.260-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865419261 }} },{ "_id":222679,"title":"2012 Subaru Impreza","subTitle":"The Impreza is the best bargain for fuel economy and comfort, while still being a fun car to drive.","slug":"2012-subaru-impreza","promoTitle":"2012 Subaru Impreza","promoTeaserSmall":"2012 Subaru Impreza","promoTeaser":"2012 Subaru Impreza","keywords":["2012 Subaru Impreza"],"metaTitle":"2012 Subaru Impreza Buyer's Guide -  Jean Knows Cars","metaKeywords":["2012","Subaru","Impreza"],"metaDescription":"Learn more about the 2012 Subaru Impreza here at JeanKnowsCars.com","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2012-09-28T17:21:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2012-09-28T17:21:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"buyer_guide","webExclusive":false,"url":"/new-cars/subaru/2012-subaru-impreza/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[],"categories":[{"alias":"Subaru","id":1025701,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/new-cars/subaru","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"new-cars","id":1024395,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/new-cars","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-10-28T10:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"subaru-impreza-2012-header","title":"Subaru Impreza 2012 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/82565083/subaru-impreza-2012-header.jpg","fileMasterId":82565083,"fileName":"subaru-impreza-2012-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}}},"pages":[{"id":239406,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The new Impreza is the roomiest Impreza ever with a longer wheelbase.

There are also numerous compartments to stow your life’s necessities, like phones and purses. With more room comes more fuel economy in the Impreza.

The new Impreza’s exterior has gone through a makeover, returning to Subaru’s original sporty design. You can choose between a four-door or five-door model, both with bolder and more dynamic exterior designs. Both models come standard with carpeted floor mats, a standard item most automakers don’t offer. Also offered is more flexible storage space, including a split-folding back seat, perfect for transporting life’s adventures.

Once you put yourself in the driver’s seat and feel the standard leather-wrapped steering wheel, all you have to do is push the start/stop button and you are ready to embrace your inner racer. The BRZ comes with a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission, but if you want to experience the BRZ as it was intended, go with the manual. Driving the BRZ should be fun, and the engineers at Subaru want to make sure you keep your hands on the wheel and enjoy driving. The BRZ comes standard with a GPS touchscreen that is voice activated so you can concentrate on driving when you need to find your way. The driver also has easy-to-use controls to allow the driver to focus on the task at hand, driving.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 9","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Who would take their $113,000 truck out on the Rubicon Trail? Rather, the G-Class has a cool, authentic look that comes from form following function, and makes the driver feel like the hero in an apocalyptic action-adventure film. For 2013, Mercedes-Benz has refreshed the G with new interior appointments. Foremost among them is a freestanding, seven-inch, tablet-style central display unit. There are also steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters for manual control of the seven-speed automatic transmission. A suite of technological systems is added for parking and blind spot assistance, with adaptive cruise control thrown in for good measure. Outside on the G’s square nose, LED daytime running lights are now in place. The 5.5-liter V-8 in the G550 now produces 388 horsepower. Displacing the same volume, the G63 AMG’s turbocharged V-8 makes 544 horsepower and is equipped with automatic stop/start for fuel economy purposes.

The Smart ForTwo is great for what it was designed for – short trips in big cities where parking and gas are too expensive to warrant a full-sized vehicle. It does a fantastic job of parking in tight spaces, and can park with its nose to the curb where a normal car would have to parallel park. The gas mileage is good – 34 mpg in the city, 38 mpg on the highway – but not a huge jump over some fuel-efficient or hybrid sedans. The Smart makes up for this by being much cheaper than most hybrids, starting just above $13,000. The very small package assumes certain sacrifices, and the long-legged among us might feel claustrophobic in the Smart’s tiny interior. Luckily, a convertible model is available for those who like to feel the breeze in their hair or need extra headroom. Smart made the wise choice of keeping the interior sparse and not cluttering the already tight space. With a top speed under 70 mph, the Smart won’t get your blood pumping, but it is a good option for city dwellers, and fits well with an environment-friendly lifestyle.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

While being somewhat roomier and offering better outward visibility, it hadn’t been as much fun to drive. Did Mercedes stand around and pout over it? No, they sought to improve the GLK for 2013. The exterior is refreshed with LED daytime running lights, a new grille, and bolder-looking bumpers. New LED taillights brighten the rear. Inside, the driver looks at a colorful instrument display and everyone can enjoy the optional, multi-color ambient lighting. The latest “mbrace” telematics system connects vehicle and smartphone. Of course the GLK offers a host of features for driver assistance and active safety. The biggest news, though, is that the GLK350 is fitted with a 3.5-liter V-6 that benefits from the addition of direct injection and makes 302 horsepower. It includes automatic stop/start, a fuel economy feature, which shuts off the engine when the car sits at a stoplight, then refires it when the driver releases the brake. Rear-wheel drive is available, or you get all-wheel drive with the GLK350 4Matic. The turbo-diesel-powered GLK250 Bluetec joins the lineup early in 2013.

However, the nimbler of Scion’s five-door offerings gets the best fuel mileage of the fleet (excluding outlier Scion iQ) at 33 miles per gallon on the highway.  The xD’s interior isn’t quite spacious, but neither is it cramped. The rear seats fold flat to allow for increased cargo space. Like all Scions, the xD’s list of add-ons is almost overwhelming, and goes far beyond usual offerings of upgraded wheels and window tints. With available accessories like shocks, mufflers, and brakes, and a base price at $16,000, the xD is perfect for an enthusiast on a budget. Don’t wait too long, though. There is talk of replacing the xD with an all new model as part of Scion’s never ending crusade for novelty.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

After its first redesign, the car looks significantly different, and hasn’t improved much on handling or fuel economy. Some of the xB’s issues are mitigated by an available package from Toyota Racing Development that smooths out the handling, and the xB is extremely utilitarian for such a small car. It seats five with the seats up and boasts enough space for a move across town or a trip to Home Depot with the seats down. The spacious interior echoes the xB’s oddball aesthetic with a center-mounted dashboard and color-contrasting audio control nobs. That unconventional arrangement fits with the xB’s unique attitude, and if the base interior feels sparse it can be conveniently upgraded with all manner of Scion extras. Some of the most enticing add-ons include a navigation system and a rear-seat DVD player. Scion’s “one and done” business model could mean that the 2012 xB will be the last one, though the demise of the lovable toaster-on-wheels has yet to be confirmed. Even if it is on its last leg, the xB is affordable, practical, and it makes a statement as soon as it turns the corner.

Overall, there are six engines in the lineup, and all but one is turbocharged. These range from gas and diesel V-6s to a pair of V-8s and also a pair of V-12s. Seven-speed automatic transmissions have to cope with all this output except for the particularly beleaguered five-speed in the S65 AMG. All-wheel drive is only offered in combination with the diesel. Of course, the interior of the S-Class is lavish enough for a pasha or a panjandrum, should you need to transport one.

This is not to suggest that the tC is in any way boring. It is quick to accelerate and comes in a limited-run RS model (available only in “Absolutely Red’) that features a racy body kit and some Toyota Racing Development enhancements.  A six-speed transmission adds fuel efficiency, helping the tC inch its way above 30 miles to the gallon on the highway. The tC’s fabric seats are less than attractive, but the rest of the interior is pleasing, and the power moonroof is a nice touch. New for this model are standard Bluetooth and a Pioneer audio system. As with all Scions, the base package is just the beginning, with available after-market upgrades ranging from high performance air filters to illuminated doorsills. With a base price just under $20,000, the tC is one of Scion’s most expensive models. But with strong performance and a touch more sophistication than the brand’s other youth-mobiles, it is still a good choice.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

That’s like finding a pair of lightweight shoes that are comfortable and good-looking. The SL is a hardtop coupe and open-top roadster with a power top that folds away in twenty seconds, but when it’s up, the optional Magic Sky Control lets occupants control the darkness of the glass panel’s tint. For top-down comfort, vents in the seats deliver heat around your neck during the fall color tour. As beautiful as the SL is on the outside, it’s every bit as alluring and voluptuous inside. The seats are heated and actively ventilated (optional) for comfort. Nearly every driver assist and active safety feature you could think of except incoming missile avoidance is included. Under the long, creased hood is the SL550’s turbocharged 4.6-liter V-8 making 429 horsepower; this is outfitted with automatic stop/start for fuel economy purposes. Pusillanimous V-8 and V-12 units are in the two AMG models.

Both are tiny city cars with high gas mileage and relatively few practical uses outside the urban center. The iQ has improved upon some of Smart’s drawbacks, however, and has the dubious honor of being the smallest four-passenger car for sale in the United States. The iQ is often marketed as a 3+1 car instead of a four-seater, because the front driver’s seat is positioned further back than the passenger seat, eating up much of the rear legroom on that side. The Scion earns essentially the same gas mileage as the Smart, with 36 mpg in the city and 37 on the highway, but where it really shows its advantage is in the ride. Despite its short wheelbase, the iQ doesn’t jostle you over every bump in the road. It is also extremely maneuverable, with a turning radius almost three feet shorter than the Smart’s. If you’re looking for an ultracompact car with a little more legroom, the Fiat 500 is a safer bet, but the iQ has the rest of the bases covered.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

It feels and looks like a more expensive car, and with 22 to 25 miles per gallon in the city and 30 to 34 on the highway, it won’t give you driver’s remorse at the gas station. The FR-S’s insides come from Subaru, who are building this car and its twin, the Subaru BRZ, in the same plant. The FR-S is still unmistakably a Scion, with aggressive styling and seemingly endless available accessories and aftermarket add-ons. Despite its cramped rear seats and itsy-bitsy cargo area, the FR-S is easy to love. The car is well balanced which makes for smooth handling, and offers a turbocharged engine with either a six-speed automatic or manual transmission. The FR-S is not content to blend in, either. With colors like Firestorm and Hot Lava, this car is begging to be pulled over. But that only makes it more desirable.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

The cabin can come equipped with attractive sport seats and a satellite radio with one-year subscription. With three different bodies (wagon, hard-top, and convertible) and three different trim levels, the Cooper’s options are extensive. Even if you’ve made the big choices, there are what Mini claims to be 10 million customization combinations. All of those choices piled up can make the car a little pricey, even with its relatively low base price. The Mini is so fun and drives so well that you can’t be blamed for splurging a little, and the excellent highway gas mileage of 33 to 37 mpg could save you money in the long run.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-meter:</strong> 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

One option turns the Phantom into a theatre, with two rear monitors and a six-disc changer in the glove box. The four-passenger version has room in the backseat for a drink cabinet or cigar humidor. The Phantom is a little slower to 60 mph than the smaller Ghost, but still makes it in under six seconds while preserving Rolls-Royce’s characteristic smooth, quiet ride. Rolls likens the experience of being driven in a Phantom to a  “magic carpet ride.” The Phantom’s recent update brings a new eight-speed automatic transmission, LED lights, and slightly improved fuel consumption.

It has an aggressive forward stance and quasi-retro styling, and while the interior styling could be a little sleeker, it is undeniably fun. A center rail that runs the length of the car has colored ambient lighting and sliding rear cup holders. The black dashboard and seats can be accented with a variety of colors including bright red and blue, and the large center-mounted speedometer adds quirk – though it does have the drawback of letting passengers keep tabs on your lead foot.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Mini is already spritely, but this version looks even more quick and maneuverable. Better yet, it actually is quick and maneuverable, and certainly won’t bore you. The John Cooper Works model is the most powerful, but also the most expensive, though with strong fuel economy, you could make up the difference in time.  Like the rest of the Mini family, this two-seater features sport seats and a very large, center-mounted speedometer. The passenger cabin has a trapdoor to the trunk in case you’re transporting something too long for the tight cargo space, and a center armrest can come equipped with a built-in iPhone charging cable. The best thing about the Coupe may be its price.

The Ghost comes with coach doors (suicide doors to the déclassé), for maximum exiting ease to chauffeured passengers.

Featuring much of the same construction and technology as the Coupe, the Roadster distinguishes itself by losing the somewhat clunky hard top roof of its predecessor and serving up all the undeniable fun of a convertible. The John Cooper Works model is the most powerful, but no matter which engine model you choose the Roadster will deliver. The folding soft-top means the Roadster has even less cargo space than the Coupe and the interior can feel cramped, but the sporty-versus-space tradeoff is typical of convertibles, and the Roadster holds up well to its competition. The bold interior is almost identical to other Minis, with the large central speedometer and navigation system, toggle switches, and sport seats.  The 2013 Roadster will improve upon an already strong base by making the semi-automatic roof and rear windscreen standard, though of course this all comes at a price – specifically, a $1,200 bump from 2012. However, the Mini model of providing affordable performance automobiles rings true, and the Roadster still won’t break the bank.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

The trunk is also wood-lined, and can extend out until it is a good imitation of a picnic table.

The lithium-ion battery found in your i can be charged overnight using a 120-volt portable charger, but if you’re impatient, you have the option of having a 240-volt charging system installed in your home to charge your car in seven hours.

In fact, many cosmetic features that would generally be bundled in a package, like exterior-matching door handles and mirrors, and interior chrome trim come standard on the many of the trim levels, as do power windows, mirrors, and doors.

With Electric Power Steering, a continuously variable transmission, and a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine, the Lancer receives up to 26 mpg city and 34 mpg highway, but don’t expect a quiet ride to go along with the mileage.

In 2012, the big pickups got a six-speed automatic transmission, a boon to those who use the trucks for their intended purpose of hauling heavy stuff. The six-speed manual is also good for heavy loads with its low first-gear ratio, though. A 383-horsepower Hemi V-8 is standard, but a 6.7-liter turbo-diesel six is also available and makes 350 horsepower. The heavy-duty Rams come in eight variants and three cab styles up to the top Laramie Longhorn edition. The Power Wagon version is higher off the ground and has off-road tires, heavy-duty Bilstein shocks, skid plate protection underneath, and other adaptations for off-road excursions. Inside, you’ll find a steering wheel with finger controls, and you can get heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, and a heated steering wheel, as well as two-tone upholstery, Sirius backseat TV with three channels to choose from, and Chrysler’s Uconnect multimedia system with ten speakers. There’s in-floor storage, plus, this thing can tow up to a 22,750-pound trailer if you opt for the Max Tow package on the 3500. You might be interested to know that Chrysler finds 50 percent of heavy-truck buyers are planning to use them for work – while 100 percent are planning to use them for fun and leisure.

If you like bells, whistles, and tons of lights, you have the option of purchase a wide array of packages to customize your car.

That good news continues with the Ram’s new grille and fascia, a more powerful V-6 engine, and an eight-speed automatic transmission—which has an interesting e-shift dial instead of floor or column shifters. There’s a nod to aerodynamics with grille shutters and an air suspension that has five height settings, including two for off-road applications. The Ram 1500 also has a fuel-saving stop-start system that shuts the engine off when the truck comes to a stop, then restarts it automatically. Add to that a set of low-rolling-resistance tires, another way to improve fuel economy, and you can see how the Ram came up with class-leading mpg. A V-8 engine is still on offer, too, for those so inclined. Inside, the half-ton Ram gets the latest UConnect Access telematics with an 8.4-inch touchscreen; it has a wireless connection built in, which lets you open and start the truck remotely using Internet or smartphone and use voice commands for phone, text, navigation, and music, not to mention hook up to a variety of online services. There’s HD radio as well, a first for the Ram. All that, and a price only one percent higher than the outgoing model at $23,585 including destination for the base model.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tChevrolet Silverado 1500<br />\n2.\tFord F-150<br />\n3.\tNissan Titan<br />\n4.\tToyota Tundra","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items: </strong><br />\n1.\tAir suspension<br />\n2.\tRotary e-shift dial on eight-speed transmission","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks </strong><br />\n1.

It’s a perfectly fine engine, but if you’re a speed demon, it won’t let this 3,400-pound car accelerate very much.

That’s all changed for 2013 with the introduction of a new Veloster Turbo model to the line-up. The turbo model’s new 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder GDI engine churns out 201 horsepower, enough to make this model a serious competitor against the Honda Civic Coupe Si and the Volkswagen GTI. The engine is linked to either a six-speed manual transmission or six-speed automatic transmission. Hyundai expects the Veloster Turbo to return an estimated 38 mpg on the highway. There’s even more excitement on tap, since Hyundai has introduced one of the first matte paint treatments in the industry on the Veloster Turbo. The $1,000 optional matte gray paint is a study in high maintenance, however, since the paint comes with an eleven-page owner’s manual, a wash pad, and microfiber towels. Buyers should be prepared to shell out $4,500 more for the Veloster Turbo than they would for the base car. But they can expect extra features, such as standard heated front seats, a unique front fascia and ground effects. Both the Veloster Turbo and base Veloster handle corners with ease and make living easy in the cabin thanks to clever packaging.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br /> \n1.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

It wears its deep SUV roots proudly, a throwback to the days when all sport-utes were beefy and boxy. The Xterra appears set to live another day, since Nissan said the 2013 model will be available early next year, even though specifics will be announced at a later date. It is not expected to get a major revision. The truck-based Xterra is pitched at young, active buyers – and there’s even a built-in first-aid kit. It’s a truly capable off-roader, but suffers from mediocre gas mileage – the bane of traditional SUVs. The Xterra seats up to five and is equipped with a strong 261-horsepower 4.0-liter V-6 engine. The engine can be mated to either a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. The Xterra’s macho off-road capabilities make it less comfortable and proficient on the road than similarly priced, more refined crossovers. It is built on the same tough F-Alpha platform as Nissan trucks like the Titan and Frontier. The soft suspension on Xterra can make for a bouncy ride on hard pavement, too. The interior is far from luxurious and can’t be hosed out as easily as the cabin in the Jeep Wrangler. Extras on Xterra include a locking rear differential, skid plates, roof-mounted lights, and ceiling hooks in the cargo area.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5.5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

But Versa was the Holy Grail when it came to inexpensive cars last year after Hyundai walked away from the fight over such a title with its redesigned Accent. The base 2012 Versa sedan with a five-speed manual transmission starts at a remarkable $11,770, including a $780 destination charge. Nissan redesigned the Versa sedan for 2012 and it still has appeal for those shopping for the best value. The Versa also comes in a hatchback version, which has yet to undergo a major revision and is a carryover from the 2012 model year. The Versa sedan has much to recommend it since highway fuel economy increases to 40 mpg this year on CVT-equipped models. The sedan is equipped with a 109-horsepower 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine. A Versa sedan with a four-speed automatic transmission is new for 2013. Different trim levels on the sedan also add new features for 2013, including the addition of a rear spoiler on CVT-equipped models and goodies like a remote key fob trunk release on SL models.  In addition to excellent value, the sedan also has a huge trunk and plenty of ride comfort. On the downside, acceleration is acceptable, but not thrilling. If you’re into extreme couponing, stockpiling toilet paper, and penny pinching, the Versa should be on your shopping list.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The 4.6-liter V-8 is tuned for 362 horsepower in the GL450 4Matic and 429 horsepower in the GL550 4Matic. A seven-speed automatic transmission is common to all models. All-wheel drive is standard throughout the line. The GL gains slightly in length, width, and height. LED daytime running lights and tail lights accent the exterior, which has sleeker bumpers and a new grille. Inside, the driver looks at a colorful instrument display and everyone can enjoy the optional multi-color ambient lighting. Safety is seen to by the inclusion or availability of every sort of electronic abracadabra for lane keeping, curve-hugging, and close-to-curb parking.

The new look is a welcome change for the CX-9, which hasn’t been tweaked since 2009. The CX-9, which goes on sale late this fall, also gets several new safety features, including forward obstruction warning, lane departure warning, and a high-beam headlight control system. The big Mazda crossover will be equipped with the carryover 273-horsepower 3.7-liter V-6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission. Gas mileage in the CX-9 is so-so. The CX-9 returns 17 mpg in city driving and 24 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The CX-9 has big shoes to fill in the Mazda lineup, especially since it’s the end of the road for the Mazda CX-7, which slotted in below the CX-9. The CX-7 is being discontinued in the U.S. Pricing has yet to be announced for the redone CX-9, but it should start at around $30,000. The CX-9 has always won compliments for its communicative steering, car-like responses, and highway stability, along with good interior quality. The third row may be best left for kids, but the CX-9 is set to remain a more stylish alternative to traditional vans and boxier SUVs.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

But the subcompact delivers low fuel economy for such a small car – and doesn’t even hit the magic 40-mpg mark in highway driving. The Mazda 2 also has a steep base price for such a small car, with the base 2013 Sport model starting at over $15,000. An uplevel Mazda 2 Touring model tops $17,000. On the plus side, the Mazda 2 enters the post-modern world with a new USB port, something it lacked in the past. Its refined four-cylinder engine feels livelier than its 100-horsepower rating would suggest, especially when it’s linked to the five-speed manual transmission. A four-speed automatic transmission is optional. There’s no denying that the five-seater is a fun-to-drive city car, but there may be too many compromises for some. The Mazda 2 has a tight back seat and limited cargo room. It lacks the luxury features available in newer subcompacts like the Ford Fiesta. That means no navigation system or heated seats. The Touring model is the way to go if you’re looking for amenities. It includes fifteen-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, chrome exhaust tips, cruise control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and an audio system with six speakers. The main problem with the Mazda 2 occurs once comparison shopping begins. When you stack it up against its sizeable competition, it’s merely average.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The 2013 MKS is a redesigned model that holds on to the smooth, refined ride a Lincoln buyer is looking for while adding lots of high-tech features. Chief among those is Lincoln Drive Control, a system that will let you change almost everything about the driving experience by changing the gear selector between Drive and Sport settings. Smoothness, however, is the main point of this car, as underlined by standard Continuously Controlled Damping, which monitors suspension settings 500 times per second and adjusts the suspension twenty times per second to tweak ride quality. While you’re enjoying that ride, there’s also a new lane keeping system that can warn you of potential accidents by making the steering wheel vibrate. What’s more, it’s customizable as to when alerts are sent and how hard they make the steering wheel vibrate. The MKS’s V-6 engine choices are slightly more powerful this year, with the most fuel-efficient choice being the 3.7-liter V-6 that makes 304 horsepower and provides 18 mpg in town and 27 mpg on the highway. An EcoBoost V-6 on the all-wheel-drive MKS ups horsepower to 365, although it offers slightly lower fuel economy at 17 mpg city and 25 mpg highway. The MKS’s looks are dominated by the new split grille, but updates have also been made to the fenders, headlamps, deck lid, rear end, and exhaust tips. The interior has an all-new instrument panel with MyLincoln Touch, an expanded Sync setup, and many new color schemes. Pricing range from $43,685 for the standard model to $50,685 for the EcoBoost model, including destination.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tAudi A6<br />\n2.\tInfiniti M<br />\n3.\tLexus GS<br />\n4.\tMercedes-Benz E-Class","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech:</strong><br />\n1.\tLane keeping technology is, as Lincoln puts it, an extra “eye” on the road.<br />\n2.\tLincoln Drive Control with Drive and Sport settings.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks:</strong><br />\n1.

Two dozen years later, Lexus once again is putting the industry on notice with its latest technological tour de force, the all-new, surprisingly emotional 2013 LS. Indeed, the LS460 and the long-wheelbase LS460L have never looked better, their crisp sheetmetal offset by just the right amount of ornamentation. Lexus’s new spindle grille is flanked by high-tech headlamps, the bodysides are clean and straight, and the rear is set off by discreet trapezoidal tailpipes and beautiful taillamps with clever L-shaped LED strips that mimic the Lexus “L.” For 2013, Lexus is offering more flavors of LS than ever: customers with a wild side may opt for the first-ever LS F-Sport model, which rides lower to the ground and dons aggressive front and rear styling and technical-themed interior trim; those in colder climes may be interested in all-wheel-drive LS models; wealthy greenies may consider the pricey hybrid LS600h. Regardless of variety, each LS contains more standard comfort and technology features than we could possibly list, and among the many decadent options are a shiatsu massaging rear seat package, three different wood choices, and a “Climate Concierge” system that automatically activates seat heaters and coolers in addition to the A/C to maintain individual comfort for all passengers. The LS even rides on noise reduction wheels to ensure quietness. Once focused on chasing the luxury leaders in the segment, the 2013 LS proves that Lexus wants to lead.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\r\n1.

GMC’s Yukon and its long-wheelbase Yukon XL are getting a little long in the tooth, but they still have few peers in the art of shuttling people, hauling things, or towing trailers—or doing all three simultaneously—with space and style. On the Yukon’s long list of goodies are cool, fold-and-tumble second-row seats with one-handed operation, as well as OnStar and standard third-row seating. A Heritage edition is offered in blue, black, or white, and features twenty-inch wheels, exterior and interior commemorative badging, content upgrades and more, while the Denali model turns the Yukon into a poor man’s Cadillac Escalade. Well, not too poor of a man, as the bling-u-vee model’s signature perforated chrome grille, huge twenty- or twenty-two-inch wheels, upgraded interior materials, Nuance leather upholstery, surround sound audio system, power-release second-row tumbling seats, remote start, rear camera and park assist certainly don’t come for free. But they do add some serious pizzazz to GM’s hardy mega-ute, whether they be standard, XL, or hybrid varieties. Yes, we said “hybrid.” GM builds a hybrid version of this beast, which makes little sense for country folks, but with a third better city fuel economy, urban-dwelling Yukon intenders may want to snatch one up soon as they’re rumored to be on the chopping block when the next-gen model arrives, likely next year.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Hybrid Sierras will continue through the 2013 model year using the current body style, still achieving 33 percent better city fuel economy than the standard Sierra and 23 percent better mileage overall. Heavy-duty Sierras, which also continue relatively unchanged through 2013, gain a new “bi-fuel” version of the 6.0-liter V-8 that allows them to run on compressed natural gas (if available), or gasoline. GM’s venerable 6.6-liter Duramax V-8 is on the options list, too, in case you have any houses that need to be towed somewhere. And as before, gussied-up Denali models of both light- and heavy-duty Sierras have been offered for people who want to live it up while hauling a load. All that said, while the Sierra is a fine truck, it’s not the freshest anymore.

Still a monstrously powerful supercar but slightly less obnoxious than the wily Vipers of yore, the 2013 Viper shed its fiberglass skin in favor of more elegant, organically shaped carbon fiber and aluminum body panels that save weight while allow for far more consistent body gaps. The Viper also shed the Dodge brand name in favor of Chrysler’s Street and Racing Technology—a.k.a. SRT—brand name. Base Vipers gain infinitely more refined interiors with a customizable instrument screen and far more creature comforts (and alas, the floorboards will no longer melt your tennis shoes). The even sharper-edged (and $23,000 more expensive!) GTS model receives additional leather trim, an adjustable suspension, upgraded brakes and more. The re-imagined exterior lighting includes LED running lamps and taillamps, but the overall look is pure Viper, including the double-bubble roof (ostensibly for helmet clearance). An 8.4-liter V-10 still resides under the hood, this time with new fewer than 640 horsepower (not sure how much that is in snakepower, but it’s certainly a lot). Missing from the lineup at this point is a roadster model; the 2013 model year appears to be for coupes only. Don’t expect Dodge—er, SRT—to stay out of the convertible business for long, though.

Yes, it runs only thirty-eight miles on electric power alone—which is three miles more than last year’s model—and its rear seat is best suited for children, but consider the fuel economy: 98 mpg equivalent, in the EPA’s parlance for electric vehicles. The range-anxious will appreciate a new Hold Drive mode—added to the Volt’s Normal, Sport, and Mountain drive modes—which helps conserve battery life. On gasoline-only power, fuel economy is 37 mpg. Its fuel economy is aided by a set of Goodyear Fuel Max low-rolling-resistance tires, but they don’t appreciably hurt the ride quality. The Volt will hit a top speed of 100 mph—perhaps not the consideration uppermost on Volt buyers’ minds, but still—and, probably a number more of interest, it has a ten-to-sixteen-hour recharge time using standard household current.  Option packages add such amenities as heated front seats, perforated leather seating and steering wheel, a rear-view camera, and parking sensors at front and back. Lane departure warning and forward collision alert are other options, as is Chevrolet’s MyLink system with navigation. All that, and a range between fillups of 382 miles, if you take both the battery life and the fuel tank’s capacity into account.

But there are many ways in which the two are similar: starting with the 5.3-liter engines they share, continuing with the number of people they seat (up to nine), and how it looks inside.  It’s still a full-size SUV, even if it’s not the fullest-size you can get from the bowtie brand. It can tow up to 8,500 pounds, carry cargo up to 108.9 cubic feet, and still get 21 mpg on the highway. That latter figure is courtesy of Active Fuel Management on the 5.3-liter V-8 and a standard six-speed transmission. Then there’s the two-mode hybrid, which delivers 20 mpg in town and 23 mpg on the highway in either rear- or four-wheel-drive versions, which GM says is tops for the full-size utility segment. Considering its size (it seats up to eight) and its 332 horsepower, that is not bad—even if it’s not quite the configuration you might picture when you think “hybrid.” A Bose nine-speaker sound system (also available on the standard Tahoe LT) and a rear-vision camera are the icing on the hybrid’s cake.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tFord Expedition<br />\n2.\tGMC Yukon <br />\n3.\tNissan Armada<br />\n4.\tToyota Sequoia","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421904,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421904/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items </strong><br />\n1.\tRear DVD entertainment system with third-row DVD screen, part of the Sun, Entertainment and Destinations package.<br />\n2.\tPower retractable assist steps an option on LTZ model.<br />\n3.\tHeated power outside mirrors with integrated signal indicators, curb tilt, and ground lights (optional on LT, standard on LTZ).","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421907,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421907/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks:</strong><br />\n1.\tThree new metallic paint colors; Champagne Silver now, Concord and Blue Ray coming later in model year.<br />\n2.\tZ71 Off Road appearance package has eighteen-inch aluminum wheels, color-keyed wheel flares, chrome tubular assist steps,  a chrome front grille insert, among other things.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421964,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421964/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>New for 2013:</strong><br />\n1.

It has not been the butt of hostility the way the Hummer, for example, has been. And even though there has been a Suburban on the market for nearly eight decades, no committee has turned it into a Suburbanette or taken it off the job it is on earth to do: haul people and stuff capably. If you’re shopping for one, know that you can choose from three V-8 engines, and in half-ton or three-quarter-ton versions. Active Fuel Management is on hand to bust that eight down to four cylinders when cruising, to save on gasoline, and E85 can be used. But you don’t care about that as much as two other numbers: how much cargo, and how many people? The answers are: 138 cubic feet, and nine people. There are also comfort features on board, including a second- and third-row DVD system, touchscreen navigation, a backup camera, and heated seats in the front two rows. So what are you waiting for?

Unfortunately, the Spark doesn’t astonish with great fuel economy: it makes 28 to 32 mpg in town and tops out at 38 mpg on the highway. Since 40 mpg has become the number to beat, that’s not a brilliant figure, especially considering the Spark only offers 84 horsepower from a 1.2-liter four-cylinder engine. Five-speed manual and four-speed automatic transmissions are available, and despite its diminutive size, the Spark has a grown-up set of ten standard airbags. Chevrolet is aiming this, its first U.S.-market minicar, at city dwellers, which explains in part why it offers MyLink information and entertainment with a seven-inch color screen, Bluetooth streaming audio, and Pandora and Stitcher compatibility.

Fuel economy may not be what a full-size pickup is about, but the Silverado 1500 Hybrid can tow 6,100 pounds while getting 23 mpg on the highway—the eco equivalent of bringing home the bacon and frying it up in a pan, we guess. There’s also a conventionally V-8-powered Silverado, the XFE, that offers 22 highway mpg thanks to “aerodynamic enhancements.” New for 2013 is powertrain grade braking for models with the six-speed automatic transmission, which downshifts the transmission to cool down the brakes on those long downhill stretches. Also, there are two new metallic exterior colors, Deep Ruby and Blue Topaz. But decorative touches are a minor point. GM leaves no doubt about what kind of buyer it’s aiming this truck at, using terms like “broad shouldered” and “chiseled”—to describe the truck, not the customer, but chances are, the descriptors fit both.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tFord F-150<br />\n2.\tGMC Sierra<br />\n3.\tRam 1500<br />\n4.\tNissan Titan","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421904,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421904/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items:</strong><br />\n1.\tOptional rear backup camera.<br />\n2.\tPowertrain grade braking downshifts transmission on downhill driving to save the brakes.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421907,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421907/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks: </strong><br />\n1.\tChrome bumper standard on three trim levels.<br />\n2.\tGrab-style door handles good for glove wearers.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421964,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421964/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>New for 2013:</strong><br />\n1.\tRuby Red and Blue Topaz metallic paint colors added.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20497,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Silverado","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"Trucks","classGroup":"Truck","color":"","id":17683,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Silverado","year":2013},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"8bfe9141-264d-3530-adde-b612c376b580","type":"mediaTag","name":"Trucks","path":"/Main/Trucks"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":6},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:04:12.409-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865452411 }} },{ "_id":222818,"title":"2013 Chevrolet Silverado HD","subTitle":"Nothing says “Yes, we can” like this kind of heavy-duty work truck.","slug":"2013-chevrolet-silverado-hd","promoTitle":"2013 Chevrolet Silverado HD","promoTeaserSmall":"Nothing says “Yes, we can” like this kind of heavy-duty work truck.","promoTeaser":"Nothing says “Yes, we can” like this kind of heavy-duty work truck.","keywords":["2013 Chevrolet Silverado HD"],"metaTitle":"2013 Chevrolet Silverado HD Buyer's Guide -

We at Jean Knows Cars don’t generally give a lot of thought to the finer points of torque, but consider the Silverado HD’s 765 pound-feet of torque, which is what gives this engine its massively competent trailer-toting strength. It’s also the reason that this truck gets a heavy-duty Allison automatic transmission—which can be shifted manually by the driver when the going gets dicey. In addition to that 397-horsepower V-8 diesel, there’s a choice of bi-fuel compatible or standard V-8 power, still nothing to sneeze at. There are even heavier-duty 2500HD and 3500HD versions, three-quarter-ton and one-ton, respectively. If you are interested in a truck that can run on compressed natural gas (CNG), get the extended-cab version of the 2500HD. Like its more normal-sized sibling, the regular Silverado, the HD comes in Ruby Red and Blue Topaz metallic exterior paint for 2013.

This mid-size sedan is available either as a four-cylinder/electric hybrid or with a standard or turbocharged four-cylinder engine, all of which are paired with a fuel-friendly six-speed automatic transmission. The hybrid version, called the Malibu Eco, has General Motors’ eAssist lithium-ion battery setup, giving the sedan a 37-mpg highway fuel economy rating. That’s impressive, but not the best you can do in today’s eco-competitive marketplace. The Eco model has been dressed up with metallic, chrome, or wood accents in the cockpit, plus ice blue ambient lighting and—surprise—a swiveling radio face that hides a six-inch-deep secret storage compartment. Chevrolet calls this “the quietest Chevrolet in history,” asking you to notice its use of sound-reducing and sound-absorbing materials inside the Malibu. While you’re enjoying the quiet, note the trendy dual cockpit and the presence of the Chevrolet MyLink information and entertainment system, standard on the Eco model. Even General Motors admits that the mid-size sedan segment is “vanilla,” but the company has worked hard to position the Malibu, now in its eighth generation, as a modern contender.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tHonda Accord<br />\n2.\tHyundai Sonata<br />\n3.\tToyota Camry<br />\n4.\tVolkswagen Passat","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421904,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421904/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items:</strong><br />\n1.\tEco model has eAssist, GM’s lithium-ion battery system.<br />\n2.\tRegenerative braking with Eco model provides up to fifteen kilowatts of energy to charge battery.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421907,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421907/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks: </strong><br />\n1.\tDual cockpit not to everybody’s taste, but different.<br />\n2.\t“Powerdome” hood a little aggressive for a mid-size sedan!","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421964,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421964/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>New for 2013:</strong><br />\n1.\tAll-new four-cylinder engine.<br />\n2.\tMore aerodynamically correct body style.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20498,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Malibu","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"Sedans","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20499,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Malibu","year":2013},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:04:13.323-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865453324 }} },{ "_id":222822,"title":"2013 Chevrolet Impala","subTitle":"Swan song for the current version as an all-new design waits in the wings.","slug":"2013-chevrolet-impala","promoTitle":"2013 Chevrolet Impala","promoTeaserSmall":"Swan song for the current version as an all-new design waits in the wings.","promoTeaser":"Swan song for the current version as an all-new design waits in the wings.","keywords":["2013 Chevrolet Impala"],"metaTitle":"2013 Chevrolet Impala Buyer's Guide -

Part of its appeal this year will be a Luxury Edition package that includes heated leather front seats, a premium Bose audio system with eight speakers, a universal home remote control, and other quality-of-life features. The uplevel LT and LTZ models will be available in a new Crystal Red Tintcoat color to help the old Impala go out with a flourish. The 2013 Impala comes with a 3.6-liter V-6 that makes 300 horsepower, coupled to a six-speed automatic transmission. Despite its old-school size and shape, this sedan gets up to 30 mpg on the highway. The upcoming 2014 model will be available with a choice of three new engines, two four-cylinders (one of which is a mild hybrid) and a V-6, to go with its new look. It’s scheduled to come out in early 2013. The Chevrolet Impala may not get anybody’s heart racing, but it fills the bill just fine if what you want is a traditional big sedan.

The interior is dependable and modern-looking, with blue ambient lighting and a wraparound dashboard with an upright center stack. The exterior has a sleek front end; its raked windshield and sweeping headlamps turn the Equinox into the anti-box. The base four-cylinder engine is no powerhouse, but it can get 32 mpg on the highway if you use the transmission-adjusting Eco mode. For those who want to use their crossover for towing, or just want more power, the newly added 3.6-liter V-6 makes 301 horsepower while adding 37 horsepower over last year’s smaller V-6 engine and, as previously mentioned, with no loss in fuel economy. This front-wheel-drive five-seater may not break any new ground in style or substance, but it is a good choice for anyone seeking a moderate amount of both attractiveness and versatility in a reasonably priced package.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tFord Escape<br />\n2.\tHonda CR-V<br />\n3.\tHyundai Santa Fe<br />\n4.\tToyota RAV4","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech: </strong><br />\n1.\tEco mode on four-cylinder engine. <br />\n2.\tLane departure warning system (option on top LTZ model). <br />\n3.\tNew suspension package for model with 3.6-liter V-6 engine.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks: </strong><br />\n1.\tPower liftgate.<br />\n2.\tNew Champagne Silver Metallic exterior color coming later in model year.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585478,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585478/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>New for 2013: </strong><br />\n1.

You can get it with a turbocharged 1.4-liter engine or a 1.8-liter engine with variable valve timing that makes 138 horsepower and yields 36 mpg on the highway. Beating that is the Cruze Eco model, which has lighter suspension parts and low-rolling-resistance tires, taking top honors for a non-hybrid at 42 mpg highway for the manual-transmission model. Chevrolet has also upped the technology ante on what was already a pretty great interior. Chevy’s MyLink information and entertainment system is standard on most versions, offering Bluetooth streaming audio and voice recognition. There are also two new audio systems on offer, including one with GPS navigation and a seven-inch color touchscreen. Perhaps the most appreciated 2013 addition is an optional Enhanced Safety package with park assist, blind-spot alert, and rear cross-traffic alert systems.

Making no concessions to this late-middle-age number, in 2013 Chevrolet is selling the fastest convertible in the history of the bow-tie brand, the 427 convertible. With its carbon fiber body parts and 505-horsepower 7.0-liter V-8, it’s pretty much a droptop version of the Corvette Z06. GM is calling it a Collector Edition, so keep that in mind. The Z06 coupe comes in a limited Carbon edition that has many of the styling features of its more powerful ZR1 sibling. Speaking of the ZR1, the top Corvette’s supercharged V-8 makes 638 horsepower and lets the Vette go north of 200 mph. The big story for 2013, in addition to the last year the current-generation C6 Corvette is in production, is the Sixtieth Anniversary appearance package. It’s a pretty classy-looking Arctic White exterior with two shades of blue on the leather-wrapped interior. An optional graphics package shouts a bit more loudly about the anniversary, and naturally there is badging inside and out to make this package more special. Corvette buyers looking for something a little less pricey may prefer the lower-frills Grand Sport, still with a sub-four-second 0-to-60-mph time close to that of its pricier stablemates. Add to that the base coupe and convertible models, and you’ll see that there’s a Corvette at price points just above $50,000 to a bit over $100,000.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 9","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tAudi R8<br />\n2.\tLotus Evora<br />\n3.\tPorsche 911","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items:</strong><br />\n1.\tCarbon fiber body panels, including fenders and hood, on the 427 convertible.<br />\n2.\tMagnetic ride control.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks:</strong><br />\n1.\tSixtieth Anniversary Design package: two-tone blue seating, racing stripes.<br />\n2.\tLightweight Cup wheels on 427 convertible.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585478,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585478/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>New for 2013:</strong><br />\n1. 427 convertible is new model.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20506,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Corvette","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"Coupes","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20507,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Corvette","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"Convertibles","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20508,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Corvette","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"Convertibles","classGroup":"Sports","color":"","id":18393,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Corvette","year":2013},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"Coupes","classGroup":"Sports","color":"","id":18743,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Corvette","year":2013},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":11},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:04:15.876-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865455877 }} },{ "_id":222849,"title":"Me and My Fast Friends","subTitle":"","slug":"me-and-my-fast-friends-auto-journalists","promoTitle":"Me and My Fast Friends","promoTeaserSmall":"My female auto journalist friends and I talk about working in a (supposedly) man's world.","promoTeaser":"My female auto journalist friends and I talk about working in a (supposedly) man's world.","keywords":["Friends"],"metaTitle":"Me and My Fast Friends -

I'm lucky enough--or foolish enough--to be able to turn most of my avocations into something resembling a vocation. Except for motherhood, but that's its own reward, right?\n\nI was a record store geek back when there were record stores, and worked at the venerable (and late, lamented) Schoolkids' Records in Ann Arbor through college, while spinning jazz records at WEMU to the taxi drivers, barflies and night owls who listened during the wee hours. I then spent a dozen years as the corporate jazz buyer for the Borders Books & Music chain, a job that even in hindsight seems too good to be true.  After the music business--and Borders-imploded, I pursued another passion and joined the staff of AnnArbor.com as a food writer and community content coordinator. I spend a lot of time cooking, eating and writing, which also often feels too good to be true.\n \nAnd now cars. I’ve been a car geek since I could walk. I caught the bug from my dad, who saved up the paychecks he earned pumping gas as a teen in western New York until he could afford a gorgeous vintage 1939 Oldsmobile. My first car was my parents’ old Dodge Spirit--an innocuous-looking car that hid a turbocharged V6 under the hood. That car took me all over the country--and fast. If I shoved a Kleenex in the tape player to stop the rattling, I could easily cruise at 120 mph, a thought that now--as a mom--strikes fear in my heart.","fileMasterId":39817187,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39817187/39817187.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T12:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41118322/decompress-your-music-in-the-car+ipod-music-promo-large.jpg","fileMasterId":41118322,"fileName":"decompress-your-music-in-the-car+ipod-music-promo-large.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2190},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":3888}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T12:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41118319/decompress-your-music-in-the-car+ipod-music-promo-header.jpg","fileMasterId":41118319,"fileName":"decompress-your-music-in-the-car+ipod-music-promo-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2188},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":3888}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T12:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41118394/decompress-your-music-in-the-car+ipod-music-promo-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":41118394,"fileName":"decompress-your-music-in-the-car+ipod-music-promo-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1270},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":3888}}},"pages":[{"id":239644,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Music and cars have long gone hand in hand.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

This full-size SUV seats seven and comes in standard and extended-length forms and in rear- or all-wheel-drive versions. All are powered by a 5.4-liter V-8 that makes 310 horsepower, teamed with a smooth-shifting six-speed automatic transmission. Its towing capacity is a very capable 9,000 pounds, and it holds 128.2 cubic feet of stuff if you fold down the second row of seats. But practicality is only part of the story with the Navigator. Let’s start with the “responsibly harvested” walnut interior trim and go on upscale from there. A voice-activated touchscreen navigation system is standard, along with Sync AppLink that interacts with your smartphone, and the standard audio system is a THX II surround-sound system with fourteen (count 'em) speakers. The front seats are heated and cooled, the running boards are power deployed, and the pedals are adjustable. Safety equipment includes roll stability control with the added benefit of curve control, which maintains your hold on the Navigator when taking this big boy around curves quickly. Forward and reverse sensing systems both keep you apprised when you’re getting too close to objects. Here Lincoln gives a nod to “the full-size reality of the Navigator.”  No doubt about that! This is one large and in charge luxury vehicle for those who want to live the same way.

Lincoln Drive Control is standard. As for safety features, the MKZ gets a lane-keeping suite that includes a rearview-mirror-mounted camera to read lane markers up ahead, and there’s adaptive cruise control, blind spot alert, and a collision warning system that puts on the brakes for you if you’re about to hit something. For the back-seat passengers--and you can invite them along without guilt thanks to the interior spaciousness--there are inflatable rear seatbelts on top of the eight airbags this car already has as standard; those inflatable belts are a class exclusive, Lincoln points out. All-wheel drive is an option, and active park assist is the icing on this already very well-accessorized cake.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong>:<br/>\n1.

It actually adjusts the suspension twenty times per second to get that job done. The EcoBoost 3.5-liter V-6 engine has been upgraded for 365 horsepower (it was 355 hp last year). Curve control to keep you in charge of this big vehicle when going around curves, plus lane keeping technology, are welcome additions for 2013.

On the outside, the grille gets the new, somewhat aggressive-looking treatment similar to that of other Lincolns this year, and wheels are available in nineteen- and twenty-inch sizes. Ford’s Sync system is available in an expanded version with WiFi hotspot capability.

And when I got accepted to grad school in New York, that Escort took me across the country and into the rest of my life.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":44037138,"fileName":"why-be-like-me-and-work-on-your-first-car+1982-ford-escort-engine","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44037138/why-be-like-me-and-work-on-your-first-car+1982-ford-escort-engine","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":170},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":44037141,"fileName":"why-be-like-me-and-work-on-your-first-car+jenn-dunnaway-and-a-stripped-1982-ford-escort","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44037141/why-be-like-me-and-work-on-your-first-car+jenn-dunnaway-and-a-stripped-1982-ford-escort","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":170},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":44037144,"fileName":"why-be-like-me-and-work-on-your-first-car+1982-ford-escort-on-lift","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44037144/why-be-like-me-and-work-on-your-first-car+1982-ford-escort-on-lift","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":170},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":5,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>So what would I advise you to do?</h3>Getting an older vehicle that's a bit marginal is a great place to start, especially when you're a girl.

And how to prevail over your doubters.

And even as your car teaches you self-sufficiency, it also teaches you symbiosis. You keep this fragile old creature running happily, and in return it gets you to school and work each day, and it's all miraculously rewarding.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":40296071,"fileName":"why-be-like-me-and-work-on-your-first-car+jen-dunnaway-with-tool-box","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40296071/why-be-like-me-and-work-on-your-first-car+jen-dunnaway-with-tool-box","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":170},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":44037147,"fileName":"why-be-like-me-and-work-on-your-first-car+stripped-1982-ford-escort","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44037147/why-be-like-me-and-work-on-your-first-car+stripped-1982-ford-escort","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":170},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":44037150,"fileName":"why-be-like-me-and-work-on-your-first-car+jen-dunnaway-with-her-1982-ford-escort-article","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44037150/why-be-like-me-and-work-on-your-first-car+jen-dunnaway-with-her-1982-ford-escort-article","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":170},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":8,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":9,"text":"Though it seems impossible, my Escort now wears collector-vehicle plates and I’ve owned it for nearly twenty years.

But what you're paying for is the happy disconnect known as “peace of mind,” which isn’t the same as wisdom or patience or skill. These things can be given to you by a humbler car with a much lower price. If you're up for a bit of adventure, don't buy something that's so fancy that you're locked out of even changing the oil on it; try your hand at a good used car instead. You don't need to be able to fix everything. Initially, you don't even need to know how to hold a wrench.
