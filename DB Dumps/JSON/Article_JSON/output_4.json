Although the big box may not boast up-to-the-minute looks, it’s as stalwart a work companion as ever. The E-Series comes in a plethora of types, similar to the F-Series truck lineup. E-150, E-250 Super Duty, and E-350 Super Duty versions are available in both standard and extended lengths and in both wagon (passenger vehicle) and van (work truck) versions. In wagon form, there are side windows, while the van version’s sides are an unbroken expanse of sheet metal other than the front-seat side windows. Even though the E-Series has been around forever, there are modern conveniences including anti-lock brakes, a navigation system with 6.5-inch touchscreen, and Ford’s SYNC hands-free telematics system. The Crew Chief system is an option that helps commercial users manage a fleet of vehicles and the related data such as fuel usage and maintenance records. There’s nothing lyrical about an E-Series, unless you have a whole lot of stuff to cart around, in which case its capaciousness could just be music to your ears.

My first articles focused on efforts by legislators to make once heavily polluting cars run cleaner. When I moved back to Michigan, that became my focus as I contributed extensively to the Detroit bureaus of both the New York <em>Times</em> and <em>Newsweek. </em>I became fascinated by how the automobile impacts so many aspects of our lives and reflects our styles and preferences. \n\nOver the past two dozen years as a freelancer, I've covered the auto industry for a wide variety of publications, including <em>Popular Mechanics, Scientific American,</em> iVillage, A<em>utomotive News, Ad Age, Hemispheres, Technology Review,</em> and <em>AARP. </em>I've also contributed pieces on air to public radio. My coverage has focused on such issues as the ways domestic automakers will respond to increasingly tough mandates for fuel-efficient cars while still designing vehicles that appeal to consumers, and my firsthand—and slightly scary—experience driving an autonomous car.

A set of five bars, similar to those indicating cell phone reception, appear in the dashboard. When those bars diminish to two, drivers will hear an audible chime, similar but lower in volume to a door chime, and will get a written warning in the instrument panel that says \"time for a break\" along with a coffee cup. Volvo was aiming for a more \"gentle\" sound that wouldn't scare and alarm the driver, which could cause an abrupt reaction in driving, said Adam Kopstein, who manages the North American Safety Office of Volvo Cars North America. He says the system is helping Volvo to achieve its ambitious long-term goal of designing a vehicle that doesn't crash.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>Mercedes-Benz</h4> Mercedes rolled out drowsiness detection in 2009, in the 2010 E-Class. Its \"Attention Assist\" creates a driver profile within 20 minutes of driving, which forms the baseline in determining how the driver operates the vehicle.  The system uses a steering sensor, along with software that tracks 70 inputs, including such details as where the vehicle is in the lane, how often the driver adjusts the radio controls and moves the steering wheel, and how long they've been driving. The algorithm constantly compares how the driver performs to the baseline to decide when to set off the alert. When the system identifies erratic steering corrections attributable to drowsy driving, it triggers an audible warning and a \"Time for a Rest\" message with a coffee cup on the instrument panel. The system is standard on all 2013 C-, CL-, E-, GL-, GLK-, M-, S-, SL-, and SLK-Class vehicles. Kaity Aurilio, assistant product manager of infotainment and safety technology strategy at Mercedes-Benz USA, said the inputs were gathered through 10,000 hours of testing on driver simulators by 640 students in Germany, which identified the key indicators of fatigue.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h4>Ford Motor Company</h4> Ford's \"Driver Alert\" is packaged with a lane keeping system and is offered on the 2013 Fusion and Explorer Limited as well as the 2013 Lincoln  MKS and MKT. It's also in the 2013 MKZ. It's offered as part of a $1,000 driver assist option on the Fusion and a $4,600 Lincoln technology package option that includes several high-tech features. It uses a forward-facing camera mounted behind the rear view mirror that tracks the lane lines. Driver Alert uses an algorithm to determine how much you're weaving and has five different vigilance levels. If you get to the fifth one, an alert will pop up on the instrument cluster that says \"rest suggested\" along with a coffee cup icon. If the driver continues the same pattern of erratic driving, a secondary warning says \"rest recommended\" with the coffee cup. Ford decided to package this with its lane keeping alert and lane keeping aid system because it uses the same sensor. Extensive testing of drivers who went without sleep for 24 hours and then used a driving simulator demonstrated that \"erratic driving in and out of a lane was the most robust indicator of drowsiness,\" said Jeff Greenberg, Ford's senior technical leader of research and advanced engineering. He says Ford decided to go with a suggestion for rest because NHTSA found only two strategies that effectively addressed drowsiness: caffeine and a nap of 20 minutes or more. \"We can't advise you to take a nap but we can advise you to take a break,\" he said. Ford nixed an audible alarm, since \"there is enough beeping at you in the car,\" he said.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>BMW of North America</h4> BMW offers \"Attention Assistant\" as standard on its 2013 7 Series.

Greenberg says though the scientific basis of eye closure systems is very sound, \"technically and practically being able to implement that and accurately focus the camera on the driver's eye to yield an appropriate calculation is quite challenging.\" He says there are also issues with older drivers who have droopy eyelids, where it's tough to get a clear picture of the eye.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"The technology that most suppliers and automakers are developing is based on lane tracking, not monitoring the driver's face, said David Zuby, chief research officer at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

Kay Stepper, director of driver assistance engineering, said the company has a “vision of accident-free driving” and hopes that technology like this can reduce the number of crashes--currently up to 90 percent--that are due to driver error.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"After a lunch break came the driving.

A five-speed manual transmission is standard on four-cylinder models, along with an optional five-speed automatic transmission or six-speed manual transmission for the rest of the lineup. The two-wheel-drive Frontier with the four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual transmission returns good fuel economy at 19 mpg in city driving and 23 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA.  The Frontier has a maximum towing capacity of 6,500 pounds, making it a decent workhorse. Serious truckers can opt for four-wheel-drive models with a locking rear differential, tough Bilstein shock absorbers, and skid plates. The Frontier has a smooth ride and better driving dynamics than many of its rivals, but the cabin looks dated with its cheap trim. The Frontier offers plenty of truck for the money, with a fully boxed chassis, steel construction, and leaf-spring rear suspension.

It wasn't until I headed to Washington, D.C., and began working for an environmental trade journal that I got an up close and personal look at what it takes to design an automobile. My first articles focused on efforts by legislators to make once heavily polluting cars run cleaner. When I moved back to Michigan, that became my focus as I contributed extensively to the Detroit bureaus of both the New York <em>Times</em> and <em>Newsweek. </em>I became fascinated by how the automobile impacts so many aspects of our lives and reflects our styles and preferences. \n\nOver the past two dozen years as a freelancer, I've covered the auto industry for a wide variety of publications, including <em>Popular Mechanics, Scientific American,</em> iVillage, A<em>utomotive News, Ad Age, Hemispheres, Technology Review,</em> and <em>AARP. </em>I've also contributed pieces on air to public radio. My coverage has focused on such issues as the ways domestic automakers will respond to increasingly tough mandates for fuel-efficient cars while still designing vehicles that appeal to consumers, and my firsthand—and slightly scary—experience driving an autonomous car. But my stories are less about the vehicle than the person driving it. I'm most intrigued by the way people shape cars and cars shape those who drive them.","fileMasterId":43710669,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43710669/43710669.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1562,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.juliehalpert.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Maintenance & Service Center","id":1023755,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T18:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40484222/dealer-vs-mechanic+promo-large.jpg","fileMasterId":40484222,"fileName":"dealer-vs-mechanic+promo-large.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":251},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":445}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T18:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41124436/dealer-vs-mechanic+header.jpg","fileMasterId":41124436,"fileName":"dealer-vs-mechanic+header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T18:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40484219/dealer-vs-mechanic+homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":40484219,"fileName":"dealer-vs-mechanic+homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":239855,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"\tWhen Nancy Baum and her husband were in the market for a new car, one of the most important criteria was \"whether it could be serviced by Joe.\" Joe is Joe Bird, the owner of Japanese Auto Professional Service, Ltd., an independent repair shop in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where Baum and her husband have been taking their Hondas and Toyotas for ten years. Their interest in buying local caused them to consider purchasing their first American car, a Ford Fusion. \"But then we realized Joe's only does Japanese cars,” Baum said. So, just before Labor Day weekend, they bought a 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid instead.

Bill Moss, owner of Ferris EuroService in Warrenton, Virginia, and a board member of the Automotive Service Association, says at independent shops, consumers will likely speak to an owner who has a stake in the service experience. The average ASA member consists of companies with under five employees. He also says he has less overhead than the dealer: \"I'm not paying for all the tinted glass and marble floors,\" he says, so his prices tend to be ten percent less.

She said there's such a range in the independent sector, it's hard to know the quality you're getting, while at the dealer, you can be assured the service is top-notch.

The ASE certification is the gold standard, designed to provide a yardstick for consumers to be able to identify the individuals that have the knowledge necessary to repair their vehicles properly the first time, says Tony Molla, a spokesman for The National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence, the organization providing the certifications. He says over 370,000 technicians working in both dealerships and independent repair shops have this certification. While dealers represent only 30 percent of the repair business, a larger proportion of dealer technicians are certified.

The top-of-the-line model gets a 272-horsepower 3.7-liter V6 engine linked to a six-speed automatic transmission.

Rear- or four-wheel-drive models are available, and in standard and extended lengths, light-duty or heavy-duty versions, and passenger or cargo versions. In its most extended form, the Express can seat  fifteen people; in its most muscle-bound form, it can tow 10,000 pounds. Its fully boxed frame gives it strength, if not beauty. The cargo version of the Express can be equipped with a compressed natural gas package, and the Express lineup also includes a choice five gas/flex-fuel engines and a turbo-diesel. Some modern touches, including a backup camera, a navigation-capable radio, and ultrasonic rear parking assist, have been added for 2013; all are optional. The chrome appearance package and optional Sirius XM satellite radio make the workday go more pleasantly, but this is no consumer-market minivan, nor does it try to be.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 3","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.\tFord E-Series<br />\n2.\tGMC Savana<br />\n3.\tNissan NV","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech Items:</strong><br />\n1.\tDedicated CNG version.<br />\n2.\tComputer-controlled glow plugs start turbo-diesel engine in less than three seconds in temperatures as low as negative twenty degrees Fahrenheit without a block heater.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855945,"fileName":"Looks.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855945/Looks.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":36},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":65}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>Looks:</strong><br />\n1.\tDoor choices include 60/40 split-folding passenger’s and driver’s door.<br />\n2.\tWheatland Yellow a new exterior color choice. <br />\n3.\tChrome appearance package.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585478,"fileName":"New.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585478/New.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":53},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":56}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>New for 2013:</strong><br />\n1.\tRear park assist, backup camera (optional).<br />\n2.\tNavigation radio (optional).","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"Crossover","color":"","id":20600,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Express","year":2013},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":8},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:04:32.991-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865472993 }} },{ "_id":223006,"title":"2013 Chevrolet Sonic","subTitle":"Don’t let its small size and cute appearance fool you: this car is not bad at all.","slug":"2013-chevrolet-sonic","promoTitle":"2013 Chevrolet Sonic","promoTeaserSmall":"Don’t let its small size and cute appearance fool you: this car is not bad at all.","promoTeaser":"Don’t let its small size and cute appearance fool you: this car is not bad at all.","keywords":["2013 Chevrolet Sonic"],"metaTitle":"2013 Chevrolet Sonic Buyer's Guide -

Available in both sedan and hatchback body styles, the U.S.-built Sonic weighs a pretty imposing 2,600 pounds and has ten standard airbags, so it’s no lightweight either literally or figuratively. Its four-cylinder engine choices are the same as those on the larger Cruze. There’s also a turbocharged RS sport hatchback, new this year, which will go on sale in late 2012. The RS’s sportiness is telegraphed by four-wheel disc brakes, a lowered ride height, more assertive chassis and transmission setups, and a leather-trimmed interior, plus red accents and aluminum pedals. You could actually plan to carry back-seat passengers without apologizing, thanks to a relatively roomy interior. An optional Connectivity and Cruise package adds a USB port, Bluetooth audio, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, and cruise control, and Chevrolet’s MyLink information and entertainment system is available on the uplevel LTZ model and the RS.

As with the Camry, the Venza is a very good car that offers Lexus-like quietness and a spacious and nicely assembled and somewhat austere cabin. It is available in three trim levels and behind its new headlamps and gaping, chrome-drenched grille is the choice of fuel-efficient four- or six-cylinder engines. Something the Venza does not inherit from the Camry is a hybrid version, but it does trump its sedan sibling by offering all-wheel drive. The Venza also provides its occupants with a taller-than-usual seating position for excellent outward vision, at least to the front (rear vision is hampered by thick pillars), while ample storage awaits out back. Families needing a third-row seat and/or an even better view of the road ahead could look at the Highlander (which, incidentally, is also Camry-based) but they won’t get as car-like an experience as offered by the Venza.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 4","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong>:<br/>\n1.

Introduced last year as all new, the hatchback was more of a “top hat” redesign replacing the previous Yaris’s body but not the low-powered 1.5-liter engine or the somewhat dated four-speed automatic/five-speed manual transmission choices. As a result, the Yaris is underwhelming, especially considering how strong most of its competition—namely the Ford Fiesta, Chevrolet Sonic, Hyundai Accent, and Kia Rio—has become. Not helping its cause is that it falls short of the magic 40-mpg EPA highway rating, which has become something of the gold standard against which tiny cars are measured these days. That said, the Yaris looks reasonably good, especially in five-door SE form, a trim level that also brings with it some effective performance upgrades that liven up the driving experience considerably. The interior is about as fancy as you’d expect at the sub-$15,000 price point, perhaps even less. But the Yaris does appear to have something of an airbag fetish, as no fewer than nine of the inflatables come standard, including a rare-for-the-class driver’s-side knee bag. New for 2013 is the standard fitment of last year’s audio package. Otherwise, it’s more of the same.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 3","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong>:<br/>\n1.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

It wasn't until I headed to Washington, D.C., and began working for an environmental trade journal that I got an up close and personal look at what it takes to design an automobile. My first articles focused on efforts by legislators to make once heavily polluting cars run cleaner. When I moved back to Michigan, that became my focus as I contributed extensively to the Detroit bureaus of both the New York <em>Times</em> and <em>Newsweek. </em>I became fascinated by how the automobile impacts so many aspects of our lives and reflects our styles and preferences. \n\nOver the past two dozen years as a freelancer, I've covered the auto industry for a wide variety of publications, including <em>Popular Mechanics, Scientific American,</em> iVillage, A<em>utomotive News, Ad Age, Hemispheres, Technology Review,</em> and <em>AARP. </em>I've also contributed pieces on air to public radio. My coverage has focused on such issues as the ways domestic automakers will respond to increasingly tough mandates for fuel-efficient cars while still designing vehicles that appeal to consumers, and my firsthand—and slightly scary—experience driving an autonomous car. But my stories are less about the vehicle than the person driving it. I'm most intrigued by the way people shape cars and cars shape those who drive them.","fileMasterId":43710669,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43710669/43710669.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1562,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.juliehalpert.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Soapbox","id":1034787,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/soapbox","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Safety ","id":1023754,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/car-safety","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T18:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44264742/texting-and-driving+promo-large.jpg","fileMasterId":44264742,"fileName":"texting-and-driving+promo-large.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":349},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":619}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T18:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44264739/texting-and-driving+header.jpg","fileMasterId":44264739,"fileName":"texting-and-driving+header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-16T18:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41124499/texting-and-driving+homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":41124499,"fileName":"texting-and-driving+homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":240862,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"There's no doubt that texting while driving is hazardous to the health of both drivers and others around them. That explains why thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws banning the practice. Now the question is: how effective have those laws been in deterring the behavior?","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"First, let's underline the problem, although we're sure you are already well aware that texting while driving is a very bad idea. Drivers who text while driving are six times more likely to crash than those who don't, according to a 2009 study by the University of Utah. It's difficult to determine precisely how many crashes are the direct result of texting and driving, since motorists are reluctant to admit that was the cause. But the National Safety Council found that in 2010, three percent of all crashes involved texting and driving, while 21 percent of crashes involved talking on a cell phone. Although that number may seem small, \"that risk didn't exist ten years [ago], so this is a big deal,\" said Dave Teater, the National Safety Council's senior director of transportation initiatives.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Washington State was the first to ban texting while driving, in January 2008. The penalties for violating the law vary widely, as does the enforcement. The state of Wisconsin assesses a fine of up to $400 for the first offense, while in Kentucky a first offense carries only a $25 fine. The state of New York has issued 20,000 tickets for texting while driving, but others say the laws are often difficult to enforce. A 2010 study by the Highway Loss Data Institute found no decrease in crash risk when laws against handheld cell phones were enacted. \"We don't see any evidence that texting bans are likely to make a difference in reducing crashes,\" said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"But Russ Martin, a AAA spokesman, disagrees. \"We know these laws have a significant impact on driving behavior,\" he says, pointing to laws mandating seatbelt use and drunk driving prohibitions as examples. He expects that the laws on texting and driving will ultimately have the same deterring effect, although he acknowledges that identifying drivers who text, then proving it in court, continues to be challenging.\n\nScott Kristiansen, a sergeant with the Buffalo Grove Police Department in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, knows that first hand. His state prohibits any use of electronics while driving, including texting. He says it's often difficult to see if someone is texting in a car, so he and his colleagues employ covert methods, such as having officers stand at street corners dressed as solicitors and watch people in their cars as they approach the intersection. Another tactic officers use is sitting up high in unmarked pickup trucks, from which they can look down to catch violators in their cars. He says that, as more people realize there are undercover police officers on the corners, it's likely many will change their texting behaviors.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Rader says that crash avoidance technologies being used by automakers will do far more to prevent crashes than laws banning texting while driving. One such system, forward collision warning, detects potential hazards ahead and can automatically brake if the driver doesn't react to a signal. Many car companies offer this technology under various names. Among them are Ford, Honda, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, and Volvo. Rader says the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety plans to reward manufacturers that have this available in its safety ratings, and indeed the IIHS already provides a searchable list of automakers and shows which cars have which of six forms of safety technology, including forward collision warning.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Martin agrees that these technologies could be helpful and says there is no single solution. \"Texting while driving is so ingrained in American culture. It's not a surprise people are doing it while driving,\" he says. He says a multi-pronged effort, involving driver education and strong enforcement of the law, will be the best way to prevent the practice. And these days, with everyone from AT&T to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons telling people to put the cell phone down and stop texting while driving, Martin just might get his wish.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"","images":[],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":6,"textWrap":"","type":"imagegroup","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":""}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/features/car-safety/texting-and-driving/index.html","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:04:36.812-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865476813 }} },{ "_id":223007,"title":"2013 Lexus CT200h","subTitle":"A slickly styled, reasonably priced Lexus.

Six grand less expensive than the next-cheapest Lexu-brid, the ES300h sedan, the CT200h blends Lexus luxury, value, and high fuel economy together in equal measure. While its overall rating of 42 miles per gallon is nowhere near that of Toyota’s iconic Prius, it represents a far more comfortable and sexy way to get your green on, with its nicely padded interior rendered in premium materials and the slew of available premium upgrades such as LED headlamps, radar-based cruise control, and an updated navigation system operated by Lexus’s innovative “Remote Touch” interface. Lexus calls the CT200h fun to drive, and for a hybrid, it kinda is, so long as your notion of “fun to drive” does not make acceleration a big priority. Even with the gas pedal pushed to the floor, getting up to highway speeds is a leisurely and noisy affair. The CT200h does have somewhat lively handling (again, for a hybrid), particularly with the tighter F-Sport package, which adds a snug suspension, sportier wheels, a mesh grille, metal pedals, and available black leather seats with white perforations. And the seats are decidedly sporty in the way they cup one’s bum. Still, the CT200h is for hybrid shoppers more interested in gaining access to Lexus-grade luxury and cachet than sportiness or hypermiling.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 4","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Highlights of the ES’s exterior include Lexus’s new spindle grille, flanked by predatory headlamps underscored by a row of LED running lamps. The slab-like sides are complimented by side windows outlined in chrome, while ES wraparound LED taillamps dress up the rear. Inside, passengers face a new two-tiered dashboard design with an available navigation system operated by Lexus’s mouse-like Remote Touch interface, while those in back enjoy more than four inches of added legroom. The ES350’s soft-spoken V-6 engine and silky six-speed automatic transmission are largely carryovers from the previous ES350, so don’t expect much of a character change from previous ES models. More significant is the addition of the first-ever hybrid to the ES lineup called ES300h, which swaps the base V-6 for a four-cylinder engine mated to supplemental electric power, resulting in a combined EPA fuel economy rating of 40 miles per gallon.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Truckier than the slinky RX crossover, but not quite as grandiose as the ginormous LX570, the GX460 is nearly as comfortable on the interstate as a full-size luxury car while offering nearly as much off-road dexterity as a Land Rover LR4, not that many GX460s (or Land Rovers, for that matter) are destined to venture off-road—ever. The GX seats up to seven in leather-lined luxury, though you might want to think twice before you stick your boss in the tight third-row seat. On non-carpool days, the power third-row seat folds flat to open up some much-needed cubes of cargo space, and that space becomes even greater with the second-row seats folded nice and flat. The throaty, 4.6-liter V-8 has sufficient power, but the big news for 2013 is the installment of Lexus’ new, somewhat redundantly named Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System, designed to counteract body lean both on the road and off. That’s a good thing, considering how top-heavy the GX460 is. But style-wise, the GX remains one of the only Lexuses not to feature the company’s new form vocabulary; hence, it suddenly looks old. Still, the GX460 offers a luxo-ute experience which offers as much ruggedness as comfort, all assembled with the exquisite execution for which Lexus has become famous.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Like its most direct competitor, the BMW 3-Series, the IS is compact inside and out and is tuned to provide a clear connection between the driver and the road. Also like the 3-Series, the IS is available in hardtop convertible form. Both the IS sedan and the IS-C droptop are available with a choice of two engines: one with a miserly 204 horsepower and the other with a gutsier 306 horsepower, while all-wheel drive is offered on sedans as a boon to customers who happen to live where white stuff drops from the sky every now and then. Perched atop the IS range is the brutally fast, sedan-only IS-F, powered by a monstrous 414-horsepower V-8 and riding on a road-scraping suspension. A domed hood, two pairs of vertically stacked tailpipes, a rear spoiler, and aggressively bolstered front seats round out Lexus’s efforts to sportify the IS-F. If that seems interesting but excessive, Lexus makes some of the IS-F’s visual and handling excitement available in an F Sport package for regular IS sedans and convertibles. All that said, the IS has been around for a long time, and next to its competitors, including the redesigned BMW 3-Series and the all-new Cadillac ATS, the 2013 IS feels, well, old. A redesigned IS is expected in 2013 as a 2014 model, but in the meantime, this is as sporty as it gets at the Lexus store.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>:  7 (IS); 9 (IS-F)","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

A true feast for the eyes, the LFA’s coupe-gone-wild styling is highlighted by massive air ducts and grilles all over the car, exquisite details like arrow-themed headlamps and spear-like boomerang-shaped taillamps, and a trio of exhaust pipes in the middle of the rear bumper. But the LFA’s wild styling only hints at the unbelievable experience that awaits any one lucky enough to slip behind the wheel on a long stretch of open road. The purpose-built V-10 rivals any Italian supercar in its thrust and song, while the steering serves up road feel as if on a silver platter. Two racing-style seats are all that fit in the LFA’s sexalicious interior and reconfigurable LCD gauges are truly state-of-the-art. Certainly, we’ll see that technology pop up on other Lexus models in the future, hopefully on vehicles less costly than the LFA, which Lexus brazenly slapped with a base price of $375K. For that coin, exclusivity also comes standard: production has been capped at 500 for the world, all sold as 2012 models. So why is this car listed in a 2013 buyer’s guide?

Is Lexus out of touch? If you have to ask, you’re obviously not among the “one-percenters” at whom the LX570 is aimed. Compared to Toyota’s (slightly) cheaper Land Cruiser, with which the LX570 shares many of its dirty parts, the LX570 gains distinction primarily because of its elegant Lexus styling (complete with Lexus’s new spindle grille and LED taillamps) and fancy-schmancy interior, thus allowing it to compete with high-profile status symbols such as Cadillac’s blingy Escalade and Land Rover’s legendary Range Rover. Of course, a truck this massive requires a huge engine with huge power, which, not surprisingly, comes at a cost in the form of abysmal fuel economy. Then again, that particular point tends to be more of a concern for the ninety-nine-percenters; this vehicle’s target market will be much more interested in the new Parchment leather option, spacious seven-passenger seating, and the refreshed interior with mahogany wood trim and black chrome accents. They may not even care about the pittance of cargo space behind the third-row seat. For luxury SUV buyers for whom decadence and Armageddon-grade capability are important, Lexus has a ride for you.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

As a crossover and not a trucky SUV, and with only two rows of seats and not three (like Lexus’s other two luxury utes), the RX is spacious but not excessive, capable but not corpulent, comfortable but not conspicuously consumptive. In other words, for most moderately well-to-do households with a kid or two and a dog, it is just right. Now in the middle of its product cycle, Lexus has seen fit to give its popular RX a thorough face-lift, blessing the mug with the company’s new hourglass-shaped grille and LED daytime running lamp spears, complimented by new taillamps and tailgate details. The interior is slightly upgraded with some new color and trim choices and added technology such as Bluetooth connectivity and Lexus’s new Enform suite of in-car apps, including Pandora, Bing, Facebook, and more. With driving dynamics about as benign as your great aunt Matilda, the RX has never been too exciting to drive, though a new-for-2013 F-Sport model livens things up with its tightened suspension and paddle-shifted eight-speed transmission. And of course, the hybrid RX model (which, as Lexus proudly reminds us, was the industry’s first hybrid SUV) receives the same styling and interior enhancements as the standard model with considerably better fuel economy (30 mpg versus 21 mpg combined), albeit at a steep $6,600 premium. At least a laundry list of safety features come standard on all, most notably ten air bags, including knee airbags for the driver and front passenger.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

More Hummer than Camry, the FJ Cruiser features cartoonish, Tonka toy (Tonka Toyota?) styling, making it something of a life-sized version of the knobby-tired toy trucks you may have played with in the sandbox as a youngster. Its most direct competitor is the Jeep Wrangler, to give you an idea of the FJ’s overall attitude, and with its locking rear differential, awesome ground clearance, and torquey, 260-horsepower V-6, the FJ is suitably fantastic off-road. (Side note: why Toyota never made a topless version of the FJ is simply beyond us.) On-road, it’s somewhat less at home, with horrendous blind spots, bump-a-long ride quality, and a slim, wide windshield that requires three wipers to clear. For an SUV, it also isn’t the most practical, thanks to its rear-hinged rear doors and modicum of cargo space. And don’t get us started on its fuel economy. That said, even though the FJ Cruiser is getting up there in years, we still love the way it looks.

The massive interior offers plenty of room to spread out, with a max capacity of eight hearty souls. Only one engine, a 381-horsepower V-8, does the tugging, channeling its power through a six-speed automatic, making the towing of a large travel trailer or boat an easy affair. For 2013, not much has been changed or added except for the optional navigation system (which now features Toyota’s new EnTune apps) and a new Blu-ray player for rear-seat entertainment system. Three trim levels remain on the menu: SR5, Limited, and Platinum, the latter the only Toyota other than the pish-posh Land Cruiser to cross the $60K mark.

Mazda is in something of a holding pattern with the Mazda 6 at this point, since a fully redesigned model is coming out for 2014. In the meantime, there are no significant changes to the Mazda 6. The current-generation sedan has a striking presence, with a long hood and flared front fenders. Mazda pitches it as \"sexy, yet sensible.\" The base model is nicely equipped with standard air conditioning, power accessories, cruise control, and a stereo system with six speakers. The base Mazda 6 is equipped with a 170-horsepower 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine linked to a six-speed manual transmission. The top-of-the-line model gets a 272-horsepower 3.7-liter V-6 engine linked to a six-speed automatic transmission. There are numerous options, including a rear spoiler, remote engine start on automatic-transmission models, pearl exterior paint, and a power moonroof. A $1,785 technology package bundles several items, including LED rear lights, heated side mirrors, and a power front passenger’s seat. On the downside, there is no hybrid option as there is with some of the competition.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":29,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":58,"text":"<strong>Competitors</strong>:<br/>\n1.

It also delivers better gas mileage than many of its competitors, including the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, and Ford Escape. The CX-5 with the 155-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and six-speed manual delivers 26 mpg in the city and 35 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The CX-5 uses Mazda’s new Skyactiv Technology that reduces fuel consumption and emissions without compromising driving performance. But the small Japanese SUV is far from being just a sensible pair of shoes. The shapely CX-5 is for style-conscious buyers who like Jimmy Choo and Jason Wu. There is a full complement of standard safety features, including six air bags, antilock brakes, stability control, and traction control. Options include a blind spot monitoring system and adaptive front headlights. The CX-5 doesn’t break much new ground in the cabin, but it is one of the most affordable small SUVs on the market.

Taller drivers may feel cramped with the top up and the narrow two-seat cabin may leave some feeling slightly claustrophobic. The trunk is Lilliputian. The base car comes with a manual-folding soft top; a power-retractable hard top is optional. The power top is the way to go if you live in a cold-weather state. It goes without saying that the MX-5 Miata is a blast to drive, even though the engine puts out a relatively modest amount of power. A 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine delivers 158 horsepower when mated with the optional six-speed automatic transmission. When equipped with the five- or six-speed manual transmission, it produces 167 horsepower. Models with the five-speed manual transmission deliver 22 mpg in city driving and 28 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. Standard features include air conditioning, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and cloth upholstery. Expect to pay in the neighborhood of around $25,000 for a base model.

He contributed to several books, including the entire text of the well-reviewed <em>Auto Legends</em>, now available in five translated editions -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Polish in addition to the original English version. In 1985, <em>Automobile Magazine</em> founder David E. Davis, Jr., invited him to be one of two executive editors when <em>Automobile</em> was in the planning stages. Cumberford demurred, saying he knew nothing about magazine production and claims he still doesn’t, except that it’s important to meet deadlines. He contributed features from the beginning and began his popular “By Design” column in the sixth issue, September 1986.  \n<br><br>\nIn car design, Cumberford was even more a youthful prodigy. He sketched the body for the first car ever built to his designs when he was a fifteen-year-old Los Angeles high-school student. That car, the Parkinson Jaguar Special, is still active in historic racing sixty years after it was created. Hired directly by General Motors’ legendary Vice President of Design, Harley J. Earl, Cumberford became a professional car designer at nineteen. Leaving Detroit, he returned to California to attend UCLA to study philosophy. He rejoined the automotive world in the early 1960s and has continued to create new automotive shapes since then, always as an independent design consultant. He has lived and worked in six of the fifty United States and in France, Mexico, and Switzerland. The range of his design projects includes both racing and touring cars, trucks, aircraft, boats, hovercraft, and even ecological architecture. \n<br><br>\nHe is known worldwide for strong opinions but is well-respected in the design world because it is known that he is always completely honest in his views, with no agenda other than respect for good design and good designers. “There’s no ad hominem,” he says, “I judge the design, not the designers. There are designers I really like personally who’ve been credited with designs I heartily dislike -- for reasons I always state very clearly -- and designs I love done by people with whom I have absolutely no affinity. Except that we both like their work.”","fileMasterId":74354961,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74354961/74354961.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2022,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"rcumberford@gmail.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044,6202077]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-17T15:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Mercedes-Benz Furniture","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44299878/Pleyel-2-300-x-169.jpg","fileMasterId":44299878,"fileName":"Pleyel-2-300-x-169.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-17T15:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Mercedes-Benz Furniture","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44299776/Pleyel-Piano-Header-622-x-350.jpg","fileMasterId":44299776,"fileName":"Pleyel-Piano-Header-622-x-350.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":333},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-10-17T15:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Mercedes-Benz Furniture","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41153251/Pleyel-1-980-x-320.jpg","fileMasterId":41153251,"fileName":"Pleyel-1-980-x-320.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":623}}},"pages":[{"id":241244,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"There is undoubted romance to cars, never better expressed than by Ned Jordan’s classic advertisement for his Twenties Playboy roadster saying “Somewhere west of Laramie there’s a bronco-busting, steer-roping girl…” There’s romance to pianos, too, beautifully explained in Thad Carhart’s <em>The Piano Shop on the Left Bank,</em> subtitled “Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelier.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Despite that similarity, if you try to draw a link between automobiles and pianos — or vehicles and any musical instrument, for that matter — most people cannot see any possible connection. In fact, there have been quite a few surprising associations, beginning in the nineteenth century and continuing to the very latest international motor show, the Mondial de l’Automobile in Paris this month. Along with an exotic concept car, Peugeot showed a prototype piano conceived with the aid of the venerable piano maker Maison Pleyel, which, like Peugeot itself, was founded more than 200 years ago. Pleyel is the oldest piano maker in the world, and although it is not as well known as Baldwin, Bechstein, Bosendorfer, or Steinway and Sons, it is highly respected by musicians everywhere.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>The Steinway-Daimler Connection </h3>The first automobile-piano connection was between the Steinway piano company and Gottlieb Daimler. In 1888, when the American piano manufacturer William Steinway was traveling in Europe, he heard of Daimler’s motorized quadricycle. Intrigued, he went to Cannstatt, a district in Stuttgart, Germany, to experience the vehicle for himself. He was impressed enough by his “cross country” ride that he undertook a license to build Daimler’s engines, used first for boats and streetcars and then for trucks. That led to the New York City manufacture under license of a few Mercedes-Benz cars in 1905, a venture stopped by a factory fire in 1907.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>The Pleyel-Chopin Connection</h3>Ignaz Pleyel, a student of Joseph Haydn and, in his own right, an accomplished musician and composer (forty-one symphonies, hundreds of string quartets and quintets), established his piano works in 1807 as an adjunct to his musical publishing house, Maison Pleyel. His purpose was to create instruments that enhanced the capabilities of musicians, including the virtuoso Chopin. Pleyel was a constant innovator and the first to make pianos with metal frames, as opposed to the all-wood structures used previously. That history of creation and change was one of the inspirations for the collaboration of the firm he founded with today’s Peugeot Design Lab, an ancillary part of the car company’s design operation dedicated to work for clients outside the automotive group.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>2005: BMW 507 Designer Tries Hand at Steinway Type A</h3>In recent years, there have been other exercises wherein car designers have tackled piano design.

It was classical in appearance and very beautiful, with different textures and shades of black finish, but it broke no new technical ground. As the model A-188, it is available today at an unchanged price, $77,400.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>2007: Porsche Design's Bosendorfer Grand Piano</h3>Two years later, F.A. Porsche Design proposed another classically shaped grand piano for German piano maker Bosendorfer, this time with some functional changes from the concert grand piano pattern established in 1875 by Henry Englehard Steinway. The lid was made of a honeycomb-core material, lightweight but stiff enough to reflect sounds into the concert hall. The price is $120,000, about the same as a well-equipped Porsche 911 Carrera coupe, and it looks to weigh about the same as well.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>2009: Audi Design's Bauhaus-Inspired Bosendorfer</h3>Then, in 2009, Audi Design stylists did another Bosendorfer, this time taking the backboard almost all the way to the floor. The form was clearly inspired by Bauhaus concepts from the 1920s, with carefully delineated discrete shapes for each distinct component of the whole, including the keyboard and its cover, the pedal lyre in aluminum, and the pedals themselves. Apart from the fact that the lid is hinged below the upper perimeter of the piano, there are few changes from the classical form. This piano is commercially available for about $140,000 — again, comparable to the prices of top Audi car models.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":44299797,"fileName":"Pleyel 6 622 x 350.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44299797/Pleyel 6 622 x 350.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":44299827,"fileName":"Pleyel 3 622 x 350.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44299827/Pleyel 3 622 x 350.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":44299875,"fileName":"Pleyel 2 622 x 350.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44299875/Pleyel 2 622 x 350.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":44299785,"fileName":"Pleyel 7 622 x 350.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44299785/Pleyel 7 622 x 350.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":44299815,"fileName":"Pleyel 5 622 x 350.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44299815/Pleyel 5 622 x 350.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":41153245,"fileName":"Pleyel 622 x 350.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41153245/Pleyel 622 x 350.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":7,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":8,"text":"<h3>2012: Peugeot and Pleyel Advance the Art</h3>But, as shown in the <strong>photos above,</strong> none of the efforts in the time since William Steinway went into the car business have so completely altered the idea of what a grand piano should be as the Peugeot-Pleyel project. True to Ignaz Pleyel’s open mind in moving piano design forward, the new design incorporates advanced materials — carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics, principally — with a radical repositioning and reproportioning of the technical elements of the piano. The entire sound-producing set of strings has been lowered so that it is on a level with the keyboard. Thus, the pianist’s hands can be seen by the audience, and the artist himself or herself benefits from a better sound experience.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"Instead of three legs, the piano is supported by a single pedestal formed of an aerodynamically styled carbon fiber molding.

The lid is carbon fiber, but it does not require a prop to hold it open. Instead, gas struts and a clever mechanical linkage allow the lid to be opened and positioned by one hand.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"Like the other three contemporary car-designer pianos, the Pleyel by Peugeot Design Lab is available for purchase.

I'm lucky enough--or foolish enough--to be able to turn most of my avocations into something resembling a vocation. Except for motherhood, but that's its own reward, right?\n\nI was a record store geek back when there were record stores, and worked at the venerable (and late, lamented) Schoolkids' Records in Ann Arbor through college, while spinning jazz records at WEMU to the taxi drivers, barflies and night owls who listened during the wee hours. I then spent a dozen years as the corporate jazz buyer for the Borders Books & Music chain, a job that even in hindsight seems too good to be true.  After the music business--and Borders-imploded, I pursued another passion and joined the staff of AnnArbor.com as a food writer and community content coordinator. I spend a lot of time cooking, eating and writing, which also often feels too good to be true.\n \nAnd now cars. I’ve been a car geek since I could walk. I caught the bug from my dad, who saved up the paychecks he earned pumping gas as a teen in western New York until he could afford a gorgeous vintage 1939 Oldsmobile. My first car was my parents’ old Dodge Spirit--an innocuous-looking car that hid a turbocharged V6 under the hood. That car took me all over the country--and fast.

The study, administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI), involves nearly 3,000 cars outfitted with special communication devices for research. The cars interact with one another and with signals posted permanently at intersections, on sharp curves, and on the M-14 and US-23 freeways. The study focuses on the northeast area of Ann Arbor, and participants will have the testing equipment installed in their cars over a twelve-month period. This connected vehicle study just got under way several weeks ago, part of a thirty-month overall research project. The UMTRI's director, Peter Sweatman, has said, “We feel honored to be hosting the national test environment for vehicles that don’t crash.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Connected vehicles are getting more and more buzz lately, and for good reason. The UMTRI believes that the technology has the potential to reduce up to 80 percent of \"unimpaired crashes,\" according to Francine Romine, director of communications at UMTRI. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that there are more than 10 million car crashes yearly on American roads. In 2009, the most recent year for which there's data, there were 10.8 million accidents.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"Of the cars participating in the study, the vast majority--about 2,800--carry a Vehicle Awareness Device, or VAD, which emits a signal that can be picked up by similar devices in other cars. Only about 300 cars carry a device that can both send and receive signals. Drivers of those cars get warnings when they are following another study-equipped vehicle too closely, when they may need to brake unexpectedly, or when they are approaching a sharp curve, among other things. Jim Sayer, UMTRI’s project manager for the study, says \"the real benefits will come from [devices] that both transmit and receive,\" but in order to get that data, the cars need a large pool of signals to react to.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"David Cahill, pictured here, is one of the Ann Arborites who volunteered for the connected vehicle study, and he told Jean Knows Cars about his experience. The vehicle awareness device in his car is one of the transmit-only variety.  He told us that, when the device was installed in early August, the other more advanced devices \"were not yet ready or working.\" Although the study's piece of equipment equipment, a GPS antenna taped to his windshield and shown with this article, came unstuck the day after it was installed, UMTRI told him that signal transmission would not be interrupted, and they eventually repaired the device. Aside from that issue, Cahill says the device is \"completely innocuous\" and has not interfered with his driving at all.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Cahill became interested in the study after reading about it online. He says he is \"really impressed with anything that will improve traffic safety and move toward automation,\" adding that he favors any technology that takes \"second-to-second control of a two-ton vehicle\" out of the hands of drivers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"At the end of the yearlong study, participants will receive $200. Cahill said this didn't have an impact on his choice to  participate. An interesting angle the study organizers took was to recruit among parents in the Ann Arbor Public Schools in the northeast side of town being studied, with the $200 being donated to school at the end. Romine of UMTRI said the study considered stay-at-home parents ideal candidates because of the amount of time they spend driving in the study area. Romine noted that parents often travel \"12,000 to 13,000 miles a year just driving their kids.\"","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"A few commercial vehicles have also been outfitted, and UMTRI's Sayer says there is the potential for applications to be developed that could help long-haul truck drivers to find places to park overnight. Those applications don’t exist yet, but researchers at UMTRI and other institutions are looking into developing them.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"Many in the industry and elsewhere consider connected vehicles as a crucial steppingstone to autonomous cars, although there is no reliable estimate for when cars could kick humans out of the driver’s seat. Sayer, for his part, expects that \"there will be radar-based wireless and vehicle-based systems for a long time\" before the leap to automation.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"If the idea of hooking your car up to a wireless network concerns you, rest assured that a lot of effort has gone into making sure the network is secure. When signing up for the study, Cahill was assured that all data gathered from him or his vehicle would be kept private.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"Sayer says that privacy concerns are not the biggest issue, since many of the devices used in the study do not store data. Rather, the concern is that \"someone could introduce some rogue signals\" into the environment, which could cause the devices to behave erratically. Sayer says that both device manufacturers and the federal government have worked to make the system secure.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"It will take time to hear about the results of the study.  After collecting data from vehicles at several points throughout the year, UMTRI will send the data to the Department of Transportation for analysis. No matter what the results tell us about the future of driving and traffic safety, the study’s placement in Ann Arbor is meaningful to Michigan residents, who have faced years of hard times and doubts about the future of the auto industry in this state. Cahill says he is \"delighted\" that this largest-of-its-kind study has a home here.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"And so are we!

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

She learned about cars at the kitchen table from her father Robert, the late editor of <em>Automotive News</em>. At the age of eighteen, she bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, Jennings went to Chrysler’s test track where she worked as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, she was hired as a writer at <em>Car and Driver</em> magazine when she was laid off her Chrysler job, and in 1985 she left to establish <em>Automobile Magazine</em> with David E. Davis, Jr., as its first executive editor. She became Editor-in-Chief in 2000 and added the title of President of <em>Automobile Magazine</em> in 2006.<br><br>\nJennings has won awards for her feature writing, for her car reviews, and for her monthly <em>Automobile Magazine</em> column “Vile Gossip.” She was the recipient of the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism. Jennings has the unique experience, sensibility, and personality to connect with women and to give them voice in the male-dominated automotive space.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

What can all the fuss possibly be about, with both options having been around for decades? Well for one thing, today's computer-mediated automatic is hardly your grandma's slushbox: the increasing technological sophistication of modern automatics is one factor that is reinvigorating and galvanizing the debate. But even as robotically precise dual-clutch automatics and trippy continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) appear to be taking over the market, the sturdy manual trans is making a modest comeback, as I reported <a href=\"http://autoholics.com/2012/05/02/-Could-The-Manual-Be-Making-a-Comeback---632074\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">earlier this year. </a>News reports last spring showed a near doubling in the “take rate” for manual transmissions, bringing the percentage of stick-equipped cars sold to the highest it’s been in five years. This may seem odd, especially since the eventual phasing-out of the manual has long been seen as a foregone conclusion.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"So why the resurgence in interest? As it turns out, the good old stick shift has a number of enduring benefits that are, as they say, recession proof. And although there isn't a lot to say about the issue at this stage that's really news, all of us who have owned or loved a car equipped with a manual gearbox have at least a handful of ironclad reasons why they are the superior choice. Here are mine:","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>1. Mechanical simplicity.</strong> If you've done your homework, you're well versed in all the technobabble associated with the modern automatic transmission. But this is one area where it's possible to have too much of a good thing. A lot of the more cutting-edge innovations are still in their relative infancy, and driving vehicles that are so equipped, you can definitely feel it: you might think of the CVT, for example, as the new early-1990s airbag. Plus, there's no telling whether the new gadgetry will stand the test of time; as with touch screens and \"smart\" crash-avoidance systems, it’s impossible to know what kind of shape all that electronica will be in ten years down the road. While tech-loaded trannies can do some impressive things, they certainly require increasing levels of esoteric knowledge to work on, and there's something a little disconcerting about being so locked out of your own car. On some new automatics, you can't even check the fluid level anymore. By contrast, a manual gearbox is pretty much the same creature that it was forty years ago. Sure, they can come with glitchy tech, too, like hill-hold or skip-shift nannies, but for the most part these features are not integral to the unit's functioning. And unless you've ended up with the rare truly defective manual transmission, there's a whole lot less that can go wrong over the lifetime of your vehicle.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<strong>2. Extra cash.</strong> While it used to be that opting for the manual would guarantee you better gas mileage, today's computer-controlled automatics are optimized for fuel economy and shift more precisely to that end than any human being ever could. When you look at fuel mileage ratings between automatics and manuals for the same model, you'll find that, industry-wide, it's pretty much a wash: sometimes the manual still yields an edge of one or two mpg, sometimes the auto has the upper hand. So although saving money at the pump is no longer a big part of the conversation, a manual-equipped vehicle still has the ability to put extra money in your bank account at least twice during its lifetime: when you buy it, and when you get it serviced. A car with a stick shift still rings in at several hundred dollars cheaper than its automatic-equipped counterpart. The gap can become even more pronounced when you're shopping used cars, as dealers will often discount limited-market manuals deeply to move them out the door. As for service, see point number one above. A manual transmission is almost always more durable, uses fewer parts, and demands less frequent and less complicated service, and if anything ever goes seriously south, guess which unit you'd rather pay to replace.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<strong>3. Theft deterrence.</strong> Admittedly, the evidence for this claim is more anecdotal than anything, but a number of high-profile thwarted carjackings suggest that as manual proficiency declines among the general population, it becomes less and less likely that a criminal will know how to operate a vehicle so equipped. I'm more comfortable leaving my five-speed car idling unattended in my driveway than any  automatic-equipped car, because I'm confident that any malcontent passing by won't even be able to figure out how to get it out of the driveway (for one thing, I swapped in a five-speed gearbox in place of the car's original four, so the pattern depicted on the shift knob is deceitfully inaccurate, but that's another story). Car thieves look for easy targets and paths of least resistance, and a manual trans is neither.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<strong>4. Less texting.</strong> Let's face it, it's a lot harder to twiddle on your mobile device when your right hand is otherwise occupied. Or balance a venti latte. Or juggle a batch of drive-through takeout, or do any of the other dumb-driver things that put your accident risk through the roof. While the mechanical aspect of this issue is a no-brainer, the benefits of driving a manual go beyond eliminating physical distractions. It's become a cliche for enthusiasts to claim that in a manual-equipped car you’re \"more connected to the road,\" but it happens to be true: it's a different plane of driving, one that engages both your body and your mind. You become more focused; you burn more calories. Your parallel parking becomes an art form. Revolutions per minute and torque suddenly become a lot more meaningful. You're negotiating the subtle balance of throttle and clutch, <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/features/car-safety/ships-that-pass-in-the-night/\" \"target=\"_blank\">as associate editor Annie White noted,</a> and it forces you to pay more attention to traffic variables and road conditions, not to mention the propensities and limits of your particular vehicle. And since there are some things that are way harder to do when you're driving stick, like texting, you stop doing them and concentrate on the road instead.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<strong>5. Driving pleasure.</strong> As gas prices go up and family budgets go down, smaller and smaller fuel sippers are increasingly becoming the order of the day. No matter what other features you might consider important in a car, everyone wants the most fuel-efficient vehicle possible. The only problem is that, equipped with an automatic, most of these fuel-sipping compacts have about as much get up and go as a sack of rotten apples. But throw in a manual trans, and the balance of power shifts (!). Even the most apathetic and wheezy econobox will get an infusion of guts once you're able to drive it the way you want to, breathing new life into even the most lethargic commute. I mean, come on: if you can chirp the tires off the line in your Hyundai Accent, or throw a nice downshift to beat it through a yellow light when you’re five minutes away from the start of your first meeting, you know it's going to be a good day.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>Start Your Engines</h3>\nIf you don't know how to drive stick yet, don't sweat it. People always speak solemnly about how they're \"going to learn how to drive standard\" like they're working themselves up to apply to law school, but it's really not all that big a deal. While the best way to learn manual <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/features/car-safety/how-i-learned-to-drive-a-stick-shift/\" \"target=_blank\">as executive editor Laura Brown discovered</a> under duress, any immersion situation will do. Borrow a friend's manual-equipped car for a week and drive yourself to work in it every day. Or, if no one will lend you one, spend a few hundred bucks on a Craigslist junker and tool around in a parking lot until you get the hang of it (you can always sell it afterwards). And then don't be afraid to buy your forever car with the manual trans even if you haven't fully mastered it yet. When you look at the whole picture, driving manual is really just a way of beating the system while still playing by the rules. Sure, you can still be a goody two-shoes and drive a fuel-efficient car, but, by gum, you'll get some fun out of it. You'll spend less and enjoy more. And you'll get more  in all those ways that don't have anything to do with money.

She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn’t as dry as a piece of chalk…And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there. Not only am I a bibliophile, but I’m also a self-proclaimed Anglophile who loves Shakespeare and Elizabethan verse and one day plans to see the Houses of Parliament, visit the Tower of London, and, perhaps most important, eat real fish and chips.

My first articles focused on efforts by legislators to make once heavily polluting cars run cleaner.

My coverage has focused on such issues as the ways domestic automakers will respond to increasingly tough mandates for fuel-efficient cars while still designing vehicles that appeal to consumers, and my firsthand—and slightly scary—experience driving an autonomous car.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Check this by taking out your dipstick, wiping it off, reinserting it, pulling it back out, and making sure that the level is at or near (but not above) the maximum level indicated on the stick.

In the name of science, we tested each car in the same categories: voice and manual entry of a point of interest (we used a favorite nearby lunch spot, Zingerman’s Bakehouse), voice and manual control of the radio, voice and manual adjustments to climate control, Bluetooth pairing of a phone, voice and manual control of the phone, and voice and manual selection of a song from an iPod.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>The Talking Car Is Real</strong><br/>\nThe first system we tested was Cue, from Cadillac.

Usually, it’s best to start with the general category or device you want to use. If you’re looking for directions, commands like “destination,” “point of interest,” or “navigation” will usually set you on the right path.

However, this did give us the opportunity to test the versatility of Internet search functions. Of the six systems, Audi's MMI and BMW's iDrive were able to find the Bakehouse with an impressively low amount of fuss. MMI integrates an online search into the Point of Interest menu. Once we were online, it was smooth sailing. BMW’s iDrive doesn’t connect to the Internet, but it does appear to have the most extensive POI database. Toyota's Entune was also able to find the Bakehouse by piggybacking onto the Internet provided by my iPhone to search Bing. Internet connectivity runs about $30 a month for Audi owners, and Entune services cost up to $45 per month, but only after a generous and free three-year subscription. The other systems failed to find the Bakehouse, altough if you happen to be driving a Cadillac equipped with OnStar (we were), you can make a phone call and have directions downloaded to your car’s navigation system quite quickly.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"I had my biggest battle on the navigation front with the beleaguered MyFord Touch system, which was able to find Zingerman’s Delicatessen (a sister restaurant), but stumbled on the final command.

All but two of the systems we tested used touchscreens for control of the infotainment system, with Audi MMI and BMW iDrive using rotary dials (combined with a PDA-like touchscreen with MMI which allows you to spell out words using your fingers). I far prefer using the rotary dial to select letters and move through the system, which I found to be substantially easier and less distracting than the touchscreen. (Let me now take a moment to remind you that entering text into your infotainment system while driving is a horrible idea. I know most people do it, but you shouldn’t.) That said, most of the touchscreens were acceptably responsive and precise, so it’s really just a matter of preference.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"For most of our other tests, the systems were all fairly competent. Audi MMI does not allow you to use voice commands to control an iPod or other music device, but it does allow you to select a song manually; if you fill up the in-car hard drive with music you can ask for a song by voice. I often had a hard time finding my way around the radio systems, but if you drove any of these cars every day you would become accustomed to its quirks quickly. Ford’s Sync system (separate from, but included with, MyFord Touch) and Cadillac’s Cue were particularly skilled at quick, seamless music selection.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"All the systems had easy, reliable steps for Bluetooth phone pairing.

It was the least frustrating and most intuitive to use, and it has a cool head-up display that displays your next navigation steps discreetly on the windshield so you can look like you know where you’re going even if you don’t.

I still drive my first car, a beloved orange Chevy HHR that has been through the war and keeps on chugging. After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-11-01T06:22:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44930457/Malibu-Collection-3300-x-169-.jpg","fileMasterId":44930457,"fileName":"Malibu-Collection-3300-x-169-.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-11-01T06:22:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44930454/MalibuCollection01-622-x-350.jpg","fileMasterId":44930454,"fileName":"MalibuCollection01-622-x-350.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}},"pages":[{"id":243382,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"High fashion may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of the 2013 Malibu, but don’t tell that to the folks at Chevrolet.

I really don't. The freedom of getting behind the wheel of a car and just taking off can't be compared with anything else. You really feel that you’re in charge: in charge of the car, in charge of the road, and in charge of your life. Why on earth would you want someone else to drive you around when you could do it yourself? It’s so liberating! Obviously, I love driving. I suppose that isn't a particularly original statement for a Detroit native, but it's true. I was a little late getting my driver's license because of that pesky parallel parking, but once I got it, nothing could stop me. It doesn't matter if I have to chauffeur my grandmother to the bank less than a block from our house or drive across town. If I have my green Chrysler LHS--affectionately christened \"Betsy\" by my mother--and some gas in the tank, and if I am somehow able to avoid getting pulled over for driving just a little too fast, I'm good to go.\n\nSince I graduated from the University of Michigan, in April 2012, Betsy has taken me everywhere. She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn’t as dry as a piece of chalk…And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there. Not only am I a bibliophile, but I’m also a self-proclaimed Anglophile who loves Shakespeare and Elizabethan verse and one day plans to see the Houses of Parliament, visit the Tower of London, and, perhaps most important, eat real fish and chips.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

He’s thrilled. I’m stunned. I’ve spent a good portion of the past sixteen years buckling Cole and his younger sister, Ava, into car seats, booster seats, and backseats to keep them from dying in car accidents. And, according to AAA, car crashes are the leading cause of death for teenagers. Still, he passed the test, and the state says he is ready to drive alone. But he and I are in a standoff. He has his hand out expecting me to drop the keys into it. But relinquishing those keys goes against every one of my maternal instincts. As we circle each other, I know that I can’t make him stop racing headlong toward adulthood. I have to let go of these keys so he can learn this one last lesson from me on the road to adulthood. But here are five things I did first and that I suggest you do, too.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h4>1.\tAlways ride shotgun.</h4>\nFor the past year, Cole has been driving with a permit, and I’ve handed him the keys every time we got in the car. I’ve made him drive in every circumstance – poor weather, freeways, at night. Sometimes I drag him away from his computer for a run to the store just so he can drive. I know he will never be as careful or attentive as he is when I’m in the car, but I wanted to build up some muscle memory of not-reckless driving. And I have no intention of stopping. I’ll keep right on riding shotgun for as long as possible – even if that means dragging myself away from a comfy chair just for a ride along.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h4>2.\tHave his or her vision checked.</h4>\nWhile Cole was driving at night a few months ago, it became clear to me that Cole couldn’t see street signs in the distance as well as I could. He had passed a vision exam during a physical but -- after relentless pestering from me – admitted that he has trouble seeing the details in movies or on blackboards if he sits in the back. A trip to the ophthalmologist confirmed that glasses would help his distance vision, especially at night. Vanity does not trump safety. And when he saw how hot he looked in the glasses, he agreed.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>3.\tLook into defensive driving courses.</h4>\nThe research is mixed on whether defensive driving schools that let teens test the limits of their attention, speed, and conditions on a closed track are a good idea. The experience gives some a taste for speed. But I sent mine to the B.R.A.K.E.S. (Be Responsible and Keep Everyone Safe) defensive driving school, which is a nonprofit program run by National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) drag racing star Doug Herbert, who lost both of his sons to a freeway car accident.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<br>I know Cole. He often listens more seriously to an adult expert who isn’t me or his dad, and I knew Herbert’s real-world tragedy would help him understand why I was being such a drag. Sure enough, he came home from that school humbled and more aware of the limits of his skills and the dangers of the road. He even lectured his sister on the dangers of texting and driving.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"But I leave nothing to chance. I also asked Cole to watch the heart-wrenching documentary<em> The Last Text,</em> in which friends and family share the last text their teen sent before dying in or causing an accident. I asked him to install an app on his phone that stops him from texting and driving, but I think it’s best to use a carrier-implemented one. Doing so would ensure that he would be unable to uninstall it, and I’m sure the arrival of a girlfriend on his social scene would provide just enough temptation to try to uninstall any app that comes between them.\nThe downside to this (for me, at least) is that our service provider doesn’t sell an app like this. As soon as our cell carrier makes this a feature, I will subscribe.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h4>4.\tMake him sign on the dotted line…in blood!</h4>\nMy son’s hand, held out hoping for the keys, is a unique opportunity for me. At this moment, he will do anything to get that car. So I made him sign an agreement detailing my rules for driving. I actually used the rules on AAA’s site <a href=\"http://teendriving.aaa.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Keys2Drive,</a> which offers lots of advice for parents and teens on driving, because it was easier – and the rulers were more thorough – than anything I would have come up with. (You can download an agreement customized for your state here.) We read it through together and signed it before I let those keys drop from my fist to his.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h4>5.\tEnforce the rules and embrace curfews!</h4>\nThere are quite a few things to think about when your teen gets behind the wheel of a car. When teen drivers have teen passengers, the rate of car accidents increases exponentially. The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety says accident risk goes up 44 percent if a sixteen- or seventeen-year-old driver has just one person under twenty-one riding with him or her. This is why Cole’s provisional license limits passengers. Not surprisingly, driving at night is also hazardous. (Yeah, I know it’s not like he’s driving to school, work, or the library at that hour, but it’s dangerous just the same.) Using a cell phone is banned by good sense, me, and the state. And then there is the list of rules detailed in our AAA agreement. Also, many of his friends drive and I don’t want him to contribute to the staggering statistics about teen passengers who die when teens are driving. So I issued a curfew to keep him out of crazy, late-night choices that involve driving. I also set up some rules on how far from home I want him to go in that car without permission.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"Yep.

(Most carriers offer a feature like this.)","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<h4>6.\tFind the right car.</h4>\nI’m letting Cole drive the ancient minivan we bought when he was born because it is gutless and uncool. He won’t be able to go very fast or far in that beater, and it won’t offer much in the way of bragging rights with his friends. But as soon as he discovers that a minivan can be a lifestyle boost for a savvy teen -- it has lots of room to …err… spread out, and it seats five, which makes it great for tailgating parties -- I will go shopping for a newer car with state-of-the-art safety features. I’ll want a small car with every possible airbag and passenger protection. I probably also want OnStar (which I can add to whatever car I choose) so he can get turn-by-turn directions without using his phone and fast help if he gets into an accident. But accident rates – and insurance premiums – go way up when teenagers own their own car. So whatever car he drives, he will remain a secondary driver on it – with control of those keys clutched securely in the grasp of his control-crazed parents – for as long as possible.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"<h4>Epilogue:</h4> So far, so good. I gave Cole the car keys before the ink was dry on our written agreement. And he broke one of my rules: he failed to call when he was an hour late, within seventy-two hours of getting the keys.

It wasn't until I headed to Washington, D.C., and began working for an environmental trade journal that I got an up close and personal look at what it takes to design an automobile. My first articles focused on efforts by legislators to make once heavily polluting cars run cleaner. When I moved back to Michigan, that became my focus as I contributed extensively to the Detroit bureaus of both the New York <em>Times</em> and <em>Newsweek. </em>I became fascinated by how the automobile impacts so many aspects of our lives and reflects our styles and preferences. \n\nOver the past two dozen years as a freelancer, I've covered the auto industry for a wide variety of publications, including <em>Popular Mechanics, Scientific American,</em> iVillage, A<em>utomotive News, Ad Age, Hemispheres, Technology Review,</em> and <em>AARP. </em>I've also contributed pieces on air to public radio. My coverage has focused on such issues as the ways domestic automakers will respond to increasingly tough mandates for fuel-efficient cars while still designing vehicles that appeal to consumers, and my firsthand—and slightly scary—experience driving an autonomous car. But my stories are less about the vehicle than the person driving it.

A host of sophisticated new safety technologies are allowing cars to become occupant protectors, and that's keeping drivers far safer behind the wheel. The technologies focus on a variety of situations, allowing you to detect pedestrians in your path and avoid forward collisions. In some cases, your car will even apply the brakes for you in an emergency situation.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Each one of these technologies \"solves a piece of the larger crash problem. They really are making a difference,\" said Paul Green, a research professor at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI). A study out in July from the Highway Loss Data Institute (HDLI) that analyzed insurance claims found that these types of technologies have proven successful in avoiding crashes. In particular, there were far fewer claims filed for vehicles that had forward collision systems with autonomous braking than for those without the technology, said HLDI vice-president Matt Moore. Yes, these active safety systems started out on higher-end vehicles, but don't rule them out if you're on a budget: they are now filtering down to more mainstream cars. There is even a chance that pedestrian-detecting technology could be common as soon as the next several years. If that’s the case, Honda is already well on the way to implementing that. More than 94 percent of its 2013 model lineup will be equipped with rear-view cameras, including 100 percent of the truck lineup.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"If you are as intrigued by active safety technology as we are, you might enjoy the following rundown of what's available in several automakers' lineups, and at what price.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"Audi Pre Sense.","fileMasterId":45239733,"fileName":"Audi PreSense 622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45239733/Audi PreSense 622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":620}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"BMW lane departure warning.","fileMasterId":41078456,"fileName":"BMW Lane Departure Warning 622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41078456/BMW Lane Departure Warning 622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":348},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Cadillac Safety Alert Seat.","fileMasterId":45239730,"fileName":"Cadillac Safety Alert Seat 622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45239730/Cadillac Safety Alert Seat 622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":345},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":619}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Chrysler ParkView.","fileMasterId":45239658,"fileName":"Chrysler ParkView 622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45239658/Chrysler ParkView 622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Ford Curve Control.","fileMasterId":41111516,"fileName":"Ford_Curve_Control_Full_Size_Image_622_x_350.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41111516/Ford_Curve_Control_Full_Size_Image_622_x_350.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Honda LaneWatch.","fileMasterId":45239655,"fileName":"Honda LaneWatch 622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45239655/Honda LaneWatch 622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Mercedes-Benz Pre-Safe system.","fileMasterId":41068046,"fileName":"Mercedes Pre-Safe 622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41068046/Mercedes Pre-Safe 622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":348},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":616}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Volvo's Pedestrian Detection.","fileMasterId":41849443,"fileName":"Volvo Pedestrian Detection 622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41849443/Volvo Pedestrian Detection 622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":618}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Volvo City Safety seen in action.","fileMasterId":41849440,"fileName":"Volvo City Safety 622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41849440/Volvo City Safety 622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":8,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":621}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Subaru's EyeSight suite of safety tech.","fileMasterId":45231276,"fileName":"Subaru EyeSight 622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45231276/Subaru EyeSight 622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":9,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":349},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":4,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>Audi\r\n</h4>Audi provides a lane departure warning system available on the 2013 <strong>A8,</strong> which makes the steering wheel vibrate if the driver leaves the lane.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Walmart is currently offering a <a href=\"http://www.walmart.com/ip/Boss-Audio-637UA-In-Dash-AM-FM-CD-MP3-Receiver-with-USB-Port-and-Front-Panel-AUX-Input/15780050\"  rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Boss Audio in-dash radio</a> with AM/FM radio, a CD player, MP3 compatibility, and a USB port for $49.00, a savings of $20.99.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h4>Portable DVD Player</h4>\nIf visual stimulation is what your car is missing, look no further than Target’s sale papers.

This is fine if you’re driving a new or nearly new car, many of which come with standard Bluetooth connectivity. But if your car is more mature,  a hands-free kit can help you avoid a pesky ticket. For just $37.71 (down from $79.99) Amazon will sell you a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CLYJ2I/ref=s9_al_bw_g422_ir04?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-3&pf_rd_r=0N4ZTEBSMQEZR0F515FK&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1421662262&pf_rd_i=1077068\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">device </a>that plugs into a car’s cigarette lighter and generates a Bluetooth connection that will allow you to talk on the phone, braid your hair, and drive the car all at the same time.

This also meant that I was the jump starter of choice for girls who had forgotten to turn off their headlights and had run out the batteries in their car. You wouldn’t believe how often this happened. If you’ve got an absent-minded driver in the family, you can save people like me a lot of trouble by buying them a portable Jump-Start system. It's not as heavy duty as the ones AAA will use if you call them when your battery dies in a drive-in parking lot, but it can make the difference between stranded and started in a pinch. These kits can be charged in a wall outlet and then used to jump a car battery in just a few minutes, offering peace of mind if you or loved ones are traveling in remote or dangerous areas.

After a 115-degree desert crossing, we bore north to San Francisco, then took the northern route back through Utah and Montana. We had no itinerary, no hotel reservations, and no specific goals.
