Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-10T10:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gamer-girl-homepage","title":"forza motorsport girl","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68334651/gamer-girl-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68334651,"fileName":"gamer-girl-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2403},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":4920}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-10T10:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gamergirl-03","title":"forza motorsport girl","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68334678/gamergirl-03.jpg","fileMasterId":68334678,"fileName":"gamergirl-03.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-10T10:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gamer-girl-homepage","title":"forza motorsport girl","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68334651/gamer-girl-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68334651,"fileName":"gamer-girl-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2403},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":4920}}},"pages":[{"id":635681,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Have you ever played a game called <em>Forza Motorsport</em>?

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-11T17:22:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"altima-homepage","title":"2014 nissan altima","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823333/altima-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66823333,"fileName":"altima-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-11T17:22:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"altima-header","title":"2014 nissan altima","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823330/altima-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66823330,"fileName":"altima-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-11T17:22:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"altima-homepage","title":"2014 nissan altima","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823333/altima-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66823333,"fileName":"altima-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":617882,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2014 Nissan Altima 2.5 SL</h3>\n<strong>Price:</strong> $28,550 (base price of this model, including destination)<br>\n$30,625 as tested (including destination)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.5-liter four-cylinder, 182 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Continuously variable (CVT)<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 27 mpg city/38 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Heated leather-wrapped steering wheel<br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Lane departure warning (part of $1,090 Technology package)<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Easy Fill Tire Alert, remote start<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Blind spot warning, land departure warning, moving object detection, and a navigation system, all included in the $1,090 Technology package; Moonroof ($800)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Toyota Camry<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2014 nissan altima","caption":"","fileMasterId":66823312,"fileName":"altima-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823312/altima-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":1,"text":"I associate Nissan with slightly quirky design—think Cube, Juke, Leaf, and even Murano.

It would be hard for me to sail past those at the dealership in favor of the rather bland Altima, but it just might be the right thing to do.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"I appreciated the heated seats, steering wheel, and outside mirrors in the Michigan winter.","fileMasterId":66823318,"fileName":"altima-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823318/altima-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"The LED taillights are attractive on the 2014 Nissan Altima.","fileMasterId":66823321,"fileName":"altima-05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823321/altima-05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Nissan Altima.","fileMasterId":66823327,"fileName":"altima-07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823327/altima-07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Nissan Altima.","fileMasterId":66823312,"fileName":"altima-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823312/altima-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Nissan Altima.","fileMasterId":66823309,"fileName":"altima-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823309/altima-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Nissan Altima.","fileMasterId":66823315,"fileName":"altima-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823315/altima-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Nissan Altima has a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel.","fileMasterId":66823324,"fileName":"altima-06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66823324/altima-06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":13,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":39183,"make":"Nissan","model":"Altima","year":2014},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:12:58.503-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865978505 }} },{ "_id":485135,"title":"5 Tips from Winter Driving School","subTitle":"My day at Bridgestone's school showed me the cold, hard facts about driving well in ice and snow.","slug":"winter-driving-school","promoTitle":"5 Tips from Winter Driving School","promoTeaserSmall":"My day at Bridgestone's school showed me the cold, hard facts about driving well in ice and snow.","promoTeaser":"My day at Bridgestone's school showed me the cold, hard facts about driving well in ice and snow.","keywords":["Winter Driving School"],"metaTitle":"5 Tips from Winter Driving School - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Bridgestone Winter Driving School","Lexus","Bridgestone Blizzak tires","winter driving tires","winter tires","snow tires","driving in the snow","driving on ice"],"metaDescription":"5 Tips from Winter Driving School: My day at Bridgestone's school showed me the cold, hard facts about driving well in ice and snow.

Tires</h3>\n Maintaining proper traction is a challenge in winter conditions, so if you live where there is heavy snow, consider purchasing snow tires for the season. If you're counting on all-season tires to get you through, they won't be as useful if you have let the tread wear down. “If any tire has less than 3/32 inch of tread,” cautions Calkins, “it should be replaced.”  Also, tire pressure drops along with temperatures, so make sure yours are properly inflated.  Appropriate PSI for your tires can be found on the driver’s door frame, or check your owner's manual.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"winter maintenance 4 musts","caption":"","fileMasterId":66920701,"fileName":"winter-maint-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66920701/winter-maint-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":2,"text":"<h3>2. Battery</h3>\nBatteries become less efficient with colder temperatures so if your charge wasn’t optimal in the first place you may have trouble starting the car once the winter chill begins in earnest.

Brakes</h3>\nOn icy roads, we put an almost unreasonable amount of faith in our brakes.  Give yours a fighting chance by having them checked.  Calkins reminds us, “Brakes that tend to grab or pull on dry roads are likely to lock on ice or snow-covered pavement, resulting in a loss of stopping power and/or steering control.”  So, if you had questions about your brakes in the summer, don’t bet on them getting you safely through the winter months.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"winter maintenance 4 musts","caption":"","fileMasterId":66920704,"fileName":"winter-maint-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66920704/winter-maint-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":4,"text":"<h3>4.

If your wipers are streaking and missing sections of the glass they should be replaced.  In a long snow season Calkins says to consider winter wipers like the new \"beam\" type designed to discourage ice and snow buildup.  Remember to use an antifreeze washer fluid and keep some extra handy.  Speaking of visibility, don’t forget to clear off your car’s head- and taillights so you can see, and be seen, during winter’s dreary days and dark nights.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Once you’ve gotten the car in good working order, throw a well-stocked <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-maintenance/lists-to-survive-winter/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Winter Emergency Kit</a> in the back, and a shovel, since at some point in all our lives there’s a snowbank with our name on it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<em>Images: wipers from artist-unlimited/iStock/Thinkstock; batteryfrom Winai Tepsuttinun/iStock/Thinkstock; brakesfrom koufax73/iStock/ThinkStock</em>","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:13:00.013-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865980014 }} },{ "_id":485391,"title":"Nissan NV200: Big Yellow Taxi","subTitle":"600,000 riders take New York taxis each day.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-13T08:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cab-homepage","title":"nissan taxi story","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68436153/cab-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68436153,"fileName":"cab-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-13T08:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cab-header","title":"nissan taxi story","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68436138/cab-header.jpg","fileMasterId":68436138,"fileName":"cab-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-13T08:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cab-homepage","title":"nissan taxi story","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68436153/cab-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68436153,"fileName":"cab-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":635967,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"nissan taxi story","caption":"","fileMasterId":62113064,"fileName":"cab-07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62113064/cab-07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"<em>Photography by Susan Campbell</em><br>\n<br>When you picture traffic on the streets of New York City, it's unthinkable not to imagine yellow taxis.

I found it quite comfortable on my ride, but I would have preferred the NASA-inspired seats that have popped up in other Nissan vehicles. Since the average cab is in service for three years and will likely have well over 150,000 miles before it retires, I am thinking that the seat comfort will be greatly reduced as the miles pile on, but that would happen with any seat. And be sure that wooden bead seats will be quickly installed for many. Bluetooth is standard, but note that New York City's laws forbid a driver from using a phone while driving, even hands-free. So rest assured  no driver will use this function.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":17,"text":"<h3>How Cabdrivers Will Use It</h3>\nEvery taxi in New York City has a distress button the driver can push that lights up on the exterior of the cab to alert police or savvy observers that something is amiss in the cab.

If you are spending half your day in a vehicle, you are going to customize it to make it work for you. The NV200's front passenger's seat folds down to create a flat surface that I imagine many cabdrivers will love. There is no center console, so the cup holders, mirror adjusters, and lighting controls are way down between the seats. I assume the drivers will want to take advantage of that space and get the cup holders up to a more convenient level. The steering-wheel-mounted controls for audio and cruise control are a nice touch, and the intercom can be turned off from either cabin. There is a hearing loop system for the hearing impaired.

The New York Taxi & Limousine Commission is interested in a hybrid, Nissan's Parman says, but \"additional consultation\" still has to happen before the wheels are set in motion to bring a hybrid version of the NV200 here as a taxi. \n\nUntil that time, it doesn’t seem like hybrid buyers are going to want to eat into their profits to make the experience nicer for customers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":20,"text":"<h3>The Passenger's Point of View</h3>\nWe swung into the Amtrak parking lot to drop off our guest passenger, a full three hours ahead of his co-workers whom he had abandoned at Union Station.

The passenger compartment in the new cab is roomy and well appointed, and the big, wide sliding door is a certainly the right solution for a quick pickup in front of Chicago's Union Station. Driver Molly had to just slow down for me to jump in, and away we went. Eastward, ho! <br>\n<br>\nIn transit at highway speeds—which admittedly most taxi riders won't experience—the ride is not exactly Checker soft, suffering from highway hop on Michigan's cruel roads, but this Nissan cab is certainly quieter than any Checker ever was and feels solidly built. In my quiet, partitioned-off cabin, I was able to catch up on work as the miles rolled past, making calls and connecting with old friends and associates. Riding home from Chicago in a taxi was a novelty indeed and is now a story I am glad to have.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-13T12:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"valentine-homepage","title":"our valentine playlist","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66919222/valentine-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66919222,"fileName":"valentine-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-13T12:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"valentine-header","title":"our valentine playlist","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66919219/valentine-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66919219,"fileName":"valentine-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-13T12:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"valentine-homepage","title":"our valentine playlist","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66919222/valentine-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66919222,"fileName":"valentine-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":635933,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Time flies.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-22T10:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"runway-ford-homepage","title":"Ford Rent the Runway","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67448208/runway-ford-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67448208,"fileName":"runway-ford-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-22T10:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"runway-ford-header","title":"Ford Rent the Runway","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67448205/runway-ford-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67448205,"fileName":"runway-ford-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-22T10:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"runway-ford-homepage","title":"Ford Rent the Runway","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67448208/runway-ford-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67448208,"fileName":"runway-ford-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":597644,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"When Ford announced a one-year partnership with Rent the Runway (RTR), I was slightly confused.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Fast Women","id":1034957,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know/fast-women","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-18T12:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lafemme-homepage","title":"dodge la femme","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62285903/lafemme-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62285903,"fileName":"lafemme-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-18T12:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"la-femme-08","title":"dodge la femme","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68589819/la-femme-08.jpg","fileMasterId":68589819,"fileName":"la-femme-08.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-18T12:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lafemme-homepage","title":"dodge la femme","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62285903/lafemme-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62285903,"fileName":"lafemme-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":636378,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"dodge la femme","caption":"","fileMasterId":62285891,"fileName":"la-femme-1956.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62285891/la-femme-1956.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"Few people appreciate or even remember the La Femme, the auto industry’s first attempt to market directly to women.

Google did a refresh of the mobile version of Google Maps early in 2013, but today, if you use it from a Web browser, you will find it cleaner, prettier, more organized, better informed, and more integrated with your phone.

If a flight is available to your destination, it will do a quick calculation—based on actual flights—and include the time and cost of that option in your directions.

Most of us here aren’t racecar drivers -- we’re writers and reporters. It probably helps if you’ve attended journalism school, as I did at the University of Maryland, or worked for some periodical. That said, deputy editor Joe DeMatio now claims he was more intrigued by my second degree in Jewish studies, even though he’s never once asked me to write about the exploits of Simon bar Kochba. <br>\n2)\tKnow how to operate a manual transmission. Seems obvious, but I actually did not upon being hired. I taught myself during my first month on the job by visiting six Ann Arbor dealerships to test drive stick-shift economy cars. My sincere apologies to whoever ended up buying that Ford Focus. <br>\n3)\tLearn everything you can about cars. I grew up pouring over car magazines and memorizing zero-to-sixty times as if they were catechism. People have been asking me for car-buying advice since before I could drive. <br>\n4)\tRealize you actually know nothing about cars. A brief conversation with design editor Robert Cumberford, editor-in-chief Jean Jennings, or any other of the veterans here leaves you humbled and astounded by their wealth of automotive knowledge. It’s truly one of the best parts of working here.  <br>\n5)\tBe persistent. I wrote to <em>Automobile</em>’s editors. And called. And wrote them some more. <br>\n6)\tBe lucky. I really have no idea why then deputy editor Joe DeMatio answered my unsolicited voicemail. I hadn’t even pronounced his name correctly (it’s De-MAY-shee-oh, not De-MAH-tee-oh).

It felt great: powerful, capable, and smooth. I also appreciate all the safety features on board. If this is, as Annie says, \"the car of a wealthy retiree,\" I feel good knowing that's one more older person whose car is looking out for him or her.

The first bike from the San Francisco startup is limited to a forty-vehicle production run and is expected to hit the market in the summer. For $74,000, the Mission RS is a track-tested sport bike that boasts a top speed of 150 mph and a 0-to-60-mph acceleration time of just three seconds.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-21T07:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-homepage","title":"weekly windup 2 21","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62401610/ww-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62401610,"fileName":"ww-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-21T07:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-homepage","title":"weekly windup 2 21","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62401610/ww-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62401610,"fileName":"ww-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-21T07:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-header","title":"weekly windup 2 21","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62401607/ww-header.jpg","fileMasterId":62401607,"fileName":"ww-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-21T07:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-homepage","title":"weekly windup 2 21","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62401610/ww-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62401610,"fileName":"ww-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":636617,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"weekly windup 2 21","caption":"","fileMasterId":62401604,"fileName":"jumping.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62401604/jumping.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>1. </strong>How good are you at driving in reverse?

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

As a young adult I kicked around motor-racing, training to drive while I worked at a Brands Hatch satellite in Miami.  I've been race staff at the Detroit Grand Prix, worked TV coverage of Formula 1, Indy and NASCAR and done the occasional ride and drive program.  Eventually my racing aspirations gave way to a long held interest in filmmaking and I got my B.A. from the University of Michigan's burgeoning film program.  U of M taught me to write and introduced me to my excellent husband.  We spent five adventurous years in Los Angeles in the entertainment and publishing industries before returning to Ann Arbor where our lovely daughter came into the world.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Let's take Ford as an example, since that company was kicked all the way to the basement for 2014, ranking at the bottom of the brand rankings next to Jeep. <em>Consumer Reports</em> put that down to \"widespread reliability problems\" with its infotainment systems, as well as problems with the automatic transmissions in two models, the Focus and Fiesta.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-28T07:32:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"homepage","title":"weekly windup 2 28","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62950121/homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62950121,"fileName":"homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":316},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-28T07:32:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"homepage","title":"weekly windup 2 28","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62950121/homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62950121,"fileName":"homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":316},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-28T07:32:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"header","title":"weekly windup 2 28","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62949983/header.jpg","fileMasterId":62949983,"fileName":"header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-28T07:32:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"homepage","title":"weekly windup 2 28","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62950121/homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62950121,"fileName":"homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":316},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}}},"pages":[{"id":637543,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>1.</strong> <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em> drops the F bomb more than 500 times. <a href=\"http://laughingsquid.com/car-salesman-goes-on-hilarious-foul-mouthed-rant-during-live-tv-broadcast-of-a-commercial-in-1969/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">This video</a> only drops it three times, but it really grabbed my attention.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>2.</strong> If you are a fan of gullwings and suicide doors, you will love<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAtkoje4-eM\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> the disappearing door</a>.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Designer Walkaround","id":1034952,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-03T07:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mustang-homepage","title":"2015 ford mustang gt coupe","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63421502/mustang-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63421502,"fileName":"mustang-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-03T07:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mustang-homepage","title":"2015 ford mustang gt coupe","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63421502/mustang-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63421502,"fileName":"mustang-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-03T07:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mustang-header2","title":"2015 ford mustang gt coupe","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67535716/mustang-header2.jpg","fileMasterId":67535716,"fileName":"mustang-header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-03T07:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mustang-homepage","title":"2015 ford mustang gt coupe","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63421502/mustang-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63421502,"fileName":"mustang-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":637527,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"I met Ford's newest vice-president of design, Moray Callum, in the late 1980s when he worked as a design consultant to Ghia, a design studio in Turin, Italy, owned by Ford.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Teenagers","id":1034773,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/kids-in-the-car/teenagers","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Kids in the Car","id":1034769,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-4-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 4","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65632180/insurance-4-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65632180,"fileName":"insurance-4-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-4-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 4","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65632180/insurance-4-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65632180,"fileName":"insurance-4-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-4-header","title":"insurance tip no 4","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65632177/insurance-4-header.jpg","fileMasterId":65632177,"fileName":"insurance-4-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-4-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 4","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65632180/insurance-4-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65632180,"fileName":"insurance-4-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":616268,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"There's an important talk you probably haven't yet had, but should, with your young teenager.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Insurance agent Nathan Lamb cautions that parents should start thinking about, and budgeting for, teenage drivers when they turn fourteen, not sixteen.

Downside: Your premium will go up for a few years, now that you’ve added a young and inexperienced driver.  The number, of course, depends on the coverage you chose, but in my case, for example, were I to add my sixteen-year-old to my policy with the Fiat 500 as my only car, the total cost of my insurance would increase 65 percent.

The teen will be placed with a higher-risk insurer, which means much higher premiums.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<strong>3. Get your teen his or her own car?</strong> Nathan's advice: keep the old family car for the teen and give yourself the new one.  It costs far less to insure a teen for a clunker than a shiny new Mustang.  I’ll add that, two years ago, when I started talking to my Honda salesman about replacing my 2002 Odyssey, he advised me not to sell it or trade it in but to save it for my daughter, who was at that point fourteen.

Establish responsibility.</strong> Since you are establishing parameters for your driving teen (who is responsible for paying for gas or routine maintenance), set your teen straight on accidents as well.  Discuss how expensive they are, who pays for them, and how auto insurance works.  If you are getting your teen his or her own car, you might consider limited collision. If your teen is in a wreck because of poor choices, the onus on fixing or replacing the car falls on him or her.  Depending on the make and model year, you could be talking a couple of hundred dollars for a ding up to many thousands of dollars for major work.  How you work this with your teen falls to parenting style. I asked Nathan what he was doing with his own upcoming teenage driver.  He smiled and said, “She’ll be driving my old 2007 Camry.  And if she wrecks it, she’ll be walking until she can afford to buy her own car. It’s a one-shot deal in our house.”  That’s my kind of parenting as well, but every parent has to find his or her comfort zone.  Determine that zone before an incident so your teen understands his or her responsibility. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<strong>5.

Over that quarter-century, I went on to write general assignment stories for the <em>Milwaukee Sentinel</em>, became a cop reporter, then schools reporter and film critic for the <em>Quad-City Times</em>, where I also covered Cary Grant’s death in Davenport, Iowa, and then I worked for the <em>San Diego Business Journal</em>, where I became an expert on the arcane America’s Cup Deed of Gift. When I moved to Washington, D.C., where I wrote about the Clinton health care reform plan and other Capitol Hill issues for an inside-the-beltway newsletter publisher, I thought I had found my true calling. Matt DeLorenzo convinced me otherwise, and I moved to Detroit in 1996 to work for <em>AutoWeek</em>. Four years later, Jack Keebler lured me to <em>Motor Trend</em>, where I wrote news and rumors about future cars, voted in a dozen (each) Car of the Year and Sport/Utility of the Year competitions, and blogged as the Motor City Blogman. Detroit is to the global auto industry what Washington is to national politics. It’s easily more fascinating and as frustrating to cover as a journalist. The commute is far more interesting. \n<br><br>\nMy years at <em>Motor Trend</em>, working side-by-side with Technical Director Frank Markus, have been enormously fulfilling. I’ve become fully immersed in the nuts and bolts of cars, and the industry. You have to keep a love for cars and driving in perspective. For me, Donna, our two collies, and my family back in Wisconsin come first. I can be nearly as passionate about politics, movies and art, and the Green Bay Packers, of which I’m a shareholder. My favorite sport is still Formula 1, though.\n<br><br>\n<em>Automobile</em> is about living with cars, both the good ones and the bad ones, but most importantly, the most interesting ones. With autonomous cars on the near horizon, we face the greatest threat to our enthusiasm since the malaise and oil embargoes of the ‘70s, the era when I earned my driver’s license. With Jean, Joe and their crew, <em>Automobile</em> already has the best, most interesting writers to explain why you should put down that mobile phone and grab the steering wheel. I’m thrilled to become part of this team and I look forward to helping place the cars and the way we drive them in context.","fileMasterId":67554677,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67554677/67554677.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2031,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"todd.lassa@automobilemag.com"},{"id":2032,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/am_lassa"}],"websiteIds":[3002,3006,10009,40064,6202044,6202059,6202060,6202077,6202083,6202085,6202090]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-05T09:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"geneva-homepage","title":"report from geneva","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67606657/geneva-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67606657,"fileName":"geneva-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-05T09:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"geneva-homepage","title":"report from geneva","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67606657/geneva-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67606657,"fileName":"geneva-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-05T09:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"geneva-header","title":"report from geneva","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69237702/geneva-header.jpg","fileMasterId":69237702,"fileName":"geneva-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-05T09:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"geneva-homepage","title":"report from geneva","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67606657/geneva-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67606657,"fileName":"geneva-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":637977,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"From the land of Swiss army knives and overpriced watches comes the 84th International Salon de l’Auto, every car fan's favorite show.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Most of us here aren’t racecar drivers -- we’re writers and reporters. It probably helps if you’ve attended journalism school, as I did at the University of Maryland, or worked for some periodical. That said, deputy editor Joe DeMatio now claims he was more intrigued by my second degree in Jewish studies, even though he’s never once asked me to write about the exploits of Simon bar Kochba. <br>\n2)\tKnow how to operate a manual transmission. Seems obvious, but I actually did not upon being hired. I taught myself during my first month on the job by visiting six Ann Arbor dealerships to test drive stick-shift economy cars. My sincere apologies to whoever ended up buying that Ford Focus. <br>\n3)\tLearn everything you can about cars. I grew up pouring over car magazines and memorizing zero-to-sixty times as if they were catechism. People have been asking me for car-buying advice since before I could drive. <br>\n4)\tRealize you actually know nothing about cars. A brief conversation with design editor Robert Cumberford, editor-in-chief Jean Jennings, or any other of the veterans here leaves you humbled and astounded by their wealth of automotive knowledge.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Driving Tips","id":1034956,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-driving-tips","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-13T08:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-car-rental-homepage","title":"car insurance for rentals","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63942398/insurance-car-rental-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63942398,"fileName":"insurance-car-rental-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-13T08:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-car-rental-homepage","title":"car insurance for rentals","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63942398/insurance-car-rental-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63942398,"fileName":"insurance-car-rental-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-13T08:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-car-rental-header","title":"car insurance for rentals","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69630735/insurance-car-rental-header.jpg","fileMasterId":69630735,"fileName":"insurance-car-rental-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-13T08:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-car-rental-homepage","title":"car insurance for rentals","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63942398/insurance-car-rental-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63942398,"fileName":"insurance-car-rental-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":616269,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"January of one of the worst winters in decades, and the unthinkable happens: a Saturday morning phone call, a death in the family, and we need to drive to Washington, D.C., immediately.

Yet, on the return leg, as I was driving on the Ohio Turnpike in some of the worst conditions I have ever experienced—a highway covered in snow, whiteout visibility, and the side of the road littered with cars and semis having hit ice and one another—I wondered, with a slight pit in my stomach, about the “loss of use” policy I had heard an agent hawking to a young couple next to me at the Hertz counter. My first phone call on my return was to my agent, Nathan Lamb, to talk about insurance and car rentals.  Here are five questions I had answered.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>1. What is covered by your own insurance when you drive someone else’s car or a rental car?</h3>\nIf you have comprehensive coverage, your insurance policy extends to any car you are driving: your personal vehicle, your friend’s pickup truck, or the cute little convertible you chose to rent on your weekend getaway. Damage to your friend’s pickup would be covered by his policy; your policy covers you for your liability while driving his car. The cute convertible? You will have the same coverage for the rental convertible that your policy provides for your own car. It's a good idea to check your car insurance policy to make sure before you rent.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>2. What about “loss of use” coverage?</h3> \n“Loss of use” extends above and beyond most people’s insurance.  While your personal policy will provide you the same coverage for an accident in a rental car that it would for your own vehicle, it does not cover the losses the rental car agency experiences by having one of the cars in their fleet out of service.   They can’t rent out a car that is in the shop, hence “loss of use.”  “Loss of use” policies offered by the rental car agency protect you against the daily charge, which varies by vehicle, that rental agencies charge to recoup their losses while the rental vehicle is out of commission.  That charge can be as much as $100 per day. The rate you would pay for “loss of use insurance” is calculated by the number of days for which you rent the vehicle.  If it’s $8 a day, and you are looking to rent the car for ten days, you are adding $80 onto your rental bill. That might seem a little steep, but Nathan pointed out that this winter many body shops have two-to-three-week wait. We had a foot of snow while we were in the Washington area, and Virginia drivers are not known for their winter driving skills.  What if the person sliding through that stop sign had actually hit me?  It may have been a small dent, but the body shop could have taken fifteen days to get to it.  Suddenly, I could have been looking at $1,500 to the rental car agency for “loss of use,” even though the accident wouldn’t have been my fault.  $80 seems like a bargain compared with the $1,500 I could have been out.  Nathan’s recommendation: always get the “loss of use” insurance.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>3. How old do I have to be to rent a car?</h3>\nWe recently did an article about <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/young-people-rental-cars/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">millennials renting vehicles</a> to test them out for lifestyle fit. Note that those drivers were in the twenty-five-to-thirty-four-year-old age range. Many agencies do not rent to drivers under twenty-five, a policy that gave me fits two decades ago as my driving record was spotless compared to my “responsible” friends a couple of years ahead of me. If the agencies do rent to younger drivers or allow the second driver to be younger, most require the driver to be at least twenty-one, and the price for those in the under-twenty-five bracket is higher than for those twenty-five and above. There are some benefits to getting older.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>4. Who can drive the rental vehicle?</h3> Typically, any driver who is not a spouse or a domestic partner should be listed on the rental contract. That said, rental companies often require verification of licenses for all drivers, including spouses or domestic partners.  Moreover, some companies charge an additional fee for additional drivers, but that varies by company and state law. Additional drivers must meet the minimum age requirements. There go my sixteen-year-old daughter’s dreams of getting in some highway driving in the rental car when we do the East Coast college tour in April.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>5. Are bereavement rates a decent savings?</h3>\n I was actually at a hockey tournament in Downriver Detroit when I received that phone call, so my dear and savvy friend Simone took care of arranging the rental car details for me.  She discovered that many of the national rental agencies offer bereavement fares.  You have to be a direct relation and be prepared to have the name of the deceased and the hospital or coroner’s information.  It may be the last information you want to think about at times like this, but the savings are substantial.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"We made it back safely from our unexpected January journey east.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-12T11:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"3-7-2014-homepage","title":"weekly windup 3 14","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69603201/3-7-2014-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69603201,"fileName":"3-7-2014-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-12T11:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"3-7-2014-homepage","title":"weekly windup 3 14","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69603201/3-7-2014-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69603201,"fileName":"3-7-2014-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-12T11:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"3-7-2014-header","title":"weekly windup 3 14","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69603198/3-7-2014-header.jpg","fileMasterId":69603198,"fileName":"3-7-2014-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-12T11:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"3-7-2014-homepage","title":"weekly windup 3 14","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69603201/3-7-2014-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69603201,"fileName":"3-7-2014-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":638239,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"weekly windup 3 7","caption":"","fileMasterId":63610022,"fileName":"3-7-2014-wrx.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63610022/3-7-2014-wrx.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>1.</strong> Subaru WRX STI vs. Stick Bomb: I had never heard of a StickBomb, but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvQ9InhEKu0\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">now</a> I am obsessed. \n See the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXOhyn1Lq54\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">behind-the-scenes video</a>; it is just as mesmerizing. <br>\n<br>\nNow you need to see the <a href=\"http://www.lunatim.com/kinart/stickhistory.htm\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">details</a> on StickBombs.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>2.</strong> Sinkhole Saga: You can follow the recovery process from the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/corvettemuseum\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sinkhole at the Corvette Museum</a>.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Soapbox","id":1034787,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/soapbox","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-17T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driver-license-homepage","title":"argument on teen driving","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69772155/driver-license-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69772155,"fileName":"driver-license-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-17T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driver-license-homepage","title":"argument on teen driving","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69772155/driver-license-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69772155,"fileName":"driver-license-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-17T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driver-license-header","title":"argument on teen driving","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69772152/driver-license-header.jpg","fileMasterId":69772152,"fileName":"driver-license-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-17T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driver-license-homepage","title":"argument on teen driving","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69772155/driver-license-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69772155,"fileName":"driver-license-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":638249,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>Molly Says: No!

But I cannot ignore that, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, teen drivers' crash rates are three times higher per mile driven than those of drivers aged twenty years and older. As a parent (that's me with my daughter, Elle), that statistic is staggering. Am I alone in wondering if shifting the age higher means saving lives? Perhaps it is worth giving teenagers another reason to think adults are unreasonable?","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"As teenagers move toward independence, their frontal lobes are still developing. In fact, research suggests that it continues to develop into the twenties and even thirties.

I know many of my peers would acknowledge that we made dangerous decisions almost every day of the week when we were young drivers. Even when we lost several of our classmates it didn’t stop our risky driving. Obviously, it is against the law for members of this age group to drink, but a significant portion of teens do. Again, remember the developing impulse control, reasoning, and judgment.  Once you mix in alcohol, even good kids make bad choices. If the driving age is moved by just a year or two it may allow the maturity to keep the two separate.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<strong>My formative years of driving were in the dark ages, and by that I mean before mobile phones</strong> and the complicated infotainment options available today.

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (<a href=\"http://www.nhtsa.gov/Driving+Safety/Teen+Drivers\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">NHTSA</a>), “For drivers fifteen to nineteen years old involved in fatal crashes, 21 percent of the distracted drivers were distracted by the use of cell phones.” <br>\n<br>\n\n<strong>There are plenty of campaigns that stress no texting, but they gloss over the dangers</strong> with other smartphone functions such as apps that control stereos. My daughter promises that she will not be lured by her phone, but I question whether she will be able to keep that promise. I know that I am not setting a good example of resisting the urge to use the phone while driving. I lamely explain that I have years of experience behind the wheel. Not only does that argument not hold water, but I am sure that it goes in one ear and out the other. I do believe that more time behind the wheel in a supervised setting will provide her a better understanding of the importance of giving driving her full attention.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"I am conflicted about raising the age, but if I were starting from scratch in creating a system to develop great drivers I would start with a year of supervised driving time, followed by a comprehensive written test, and a rigorous road test.

A parent can easily and naturally take the lead in answering questions, setting examples, and participating in the driving education experience.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety feels strongly that the older teenagers are when they start driving, the fewer accidents they will get in. If you want your eyes opened, spend some time on the IIHS's <a href=\"http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/laws/gdl_calculator?topicName=teenagers \" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">risk calculator</a> for teen drivers.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Today's Kia Rio is a great little car. Ten years ago,  the Rio, for a throwaway car, was pretty damn good, but as it approached its next timing belt replacement called for by maintenance, it was gliding on its path down to where everything that needed to be repaired cost $500. So, rather than be $500ed to death, I went into buy-a-used-car mode and decided I'd donate the old Kia to charity, which I eventually did (as you see from the photo).

The paperwork they gave me was Experian’s version of Carfax, which looked on the up and up, so I decided to take the used car for a quick ride around the parking lot, and the noise it made was horrendous.

But she had a couple of new things to show me.<br>\n<br>\nIt was a snowy evening. Beth had Carfax reports waiting for me. The cars that I looked at were super clean, and she gave me a sheaf of papers to go with them, including the checklist that her dealership goes through when a used car comes in and the service papers that detailed every single thing they did to the car in response to the checklist.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-21T10:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-homepage","title":"rosie the riveter","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68614264/rosie-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68614264,"fileName":"rosie-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-21T10:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-homepage","title":"rosie the riveter","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68614264/rosie-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68614264,"fileName":"rosie-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-21T10:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-header","title":"rosie the riveter","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70394427/rosie-header.jpg","fileMasterId":70394427,"fileName":"rosie-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-21T10:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-homepage","title":"rosie the riveter","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68614264/rosie-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68614264,"fileName":"rosie-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":640200,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Red-and-white polka dot bandana?

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding.

With the Technology package (a $3,000 option), you get “smart” cruise control, blind spot detection, and lane departure warning. The blind spot detection lights up a red symbol on the side mirrors when another vehicle is near yours—which can quickly become a can’t-live-without feature once you are used to it. The lane departure warning feature is enabled with a switch to the left of the steering wheel. Choose it, and it will make an annoying “beepbeepbeep” when you even think about getting up on the center line or close to the edge of the road. The biggest magic, though, is found in the “smart” cruise control. I set it to 71—the cops in Indiana are ruthless—and enjoyed the way it showed an image of my car on the dash in front of me, then added an image of the car in front of me whenever there was one anywhere in range. Then, as soon as I got any closer than the computer’s idea of safe following distance, the car overrode the cruise control and slowed me down—all the way to 60 mph, at which time I overrode it myself by accelerating and passing the sedate Subaru that was, in my mind, plenty far ahead of me the whole time. For those of you who like to speed up on slower cars and pass them—just about everybody—you might call this frustrating. But put these three safety features together, and you are not going to be in any danger of rear-ending anybody, straying out of your lane, or missing a car, bicyclist, or motorcyclist in your blind spot. Even the heated steering wheel shepherds you along, since it's only heated in the center where your hands are supposed to be, not at the top or bottom.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"Do you see why I’d love to see my eighty-five-year-old father signing a deal to buy one of these?

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Things to Buy","id":1034789,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/things-to-buy","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-24T17:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mini-accessories-homepage","title":"decorate your mini","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68769049/mini-accessories-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68769049,"fileName":"mini-accessories-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-24T17:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mini-accessories-homepage","title":"decorate your mini","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68769049/mini-accessories-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68769049,"fileName":"mini-accessories-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-24T17:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mini-accessories-header","title":"decorate your mini","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68769085/mini-accessories-header.jpg","fileMasterId":68769085,"fileName":"mini-accessories-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-24T17:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mini-accessories-homepage","title":"decorate your mini","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68769049/mini-accessories-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68769049,"fileName":"mini-accessories-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":640367,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"I know the awkward feeling of arriving at an event wearing the same dress as another attendee and, to make matters worse, she indeed is wearing it better.

As a young adult I kicked around motor-racing, training to drive while I worked at a Brands Hatch satellite in Miami.  I've been race staff at the Detroit Grand Prix, worked TV coverage of Formula 1, Indy and NASCAR and done the occasional ride and drive program.  Eventually my racing aspirations gave way to a long held interest in filmmaking and I got my B.A. from the University of Michigan's burgeoning film program.  U of M taught me to write and introduced me to my excellent husband.  We spent five adventurous years in Los Angeles in the entertainment and publishing industries before returning to Ann Arbor where our lovely daughter came into the world.

Know your type.</strong>\nThere are many variations on the tire theme beginning with three basic categories. All-season tires, the little black dress of the tire world, are suited to a variety of driver demands. Built for longevity, they go from dry to wet to snow, all while keeping the ride quiet and the handing sufficient in most conditions. Winter tires have a unique tread that notches or bites into the snow and ice for better traction, but on clear roads, grip can suffer. Performance tires are designed for drivers who toss their cars through the corners expecting superior grip and handling in wet or dry conditions. The downside to racy performance is a softer tread that will wear more quickly and a ride you might feel in your backside.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<strong>3. Consider your climate.</strong>\nThompson says all season tires will likely do the job year round for those of us in sections of the country with moderately cold seasons and snowfall.  For dwellers in the great white north where severe winters and consistently frigid temps are the norm, she urges, “There is no substitute for winter tire usage for safe mobility.” If serious rainfall is your main weather challenge, seek out tires with a tread designed to maximize water evacuation for a reliable wet grip.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"5 rules of tire shopping","caption":"","fileMasterId":70676781,"fileName":"tire-shopper-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70676781/tire-shopper-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>4.

Some of the brand names are Michelin HydroEdge with Green X, Continental ProContact with EcoPlus Technology, Goodyear Assurance Fuel Max, and Kumho eco Solus HM KR22.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-27T09:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"bmw-x1-homepage","title":"2014 bmw x1","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70762221/bmw-x1-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70762221,"fileName":"bmw-x1-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-27T09:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"bmw-x1-homepage","title":"2014 bmw x1","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70762221/bmw-x1-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70762221,"fileName":"bmw-x1-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-27T09:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"bmw-x1-header","title":"2014 bmw x1","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68899354/bmw-x1-header.jpg","fileMasterId":68899354,"fileName":"bmw-x1-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-27T09:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"bmw-x1-homepage","title":"2014 bmw x1","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70762221/bmw-x1-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70762221,"fileName":"bmw-x1-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":641015,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Price:</strong> $33,425 base price (including destination), $41,075 as tested (including destination) <br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, 241 horsepower <br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Eight-speed Steptronic automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 22 mpg city/33 mpg highway <br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> The turbocharged four-cylinder engine<br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> The entire Ultimate package ($6,150), especially the moonroof and the power front seats<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Bluetooth connectivity, halogen fog lights, roof rails, leather-wrapped steering wheel<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Cold weather package ($700) includes heated steering wheel and front seats, retractable headlight washers; Ultimate package ($6,150) includes Homelink, keyless entry and ignition, rearview camera, panoramic moonroof, auto-dimming rearview mirror and exterior mirrors, power front seats with lumbar support, front and rear parking assist, navigation, SiriusXM satellite radio and traffic with one-year free subscription, BMW Online, BMW Apps<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Buick Encore, Ford Escape, Mini Cooper Countryman, Volkswagen Tiguan<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2014 bmw x1","caption":"","fileMasterId":70733196,"fileName":"bmw-x1-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70733196/bmw-x1-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":1,"text":"America is smitten with sport-utility vehicles of every size.

Over that quarter-century, I went on to write general assignment stories for the <em>Milwaukee Sentinel</em>, became a cop reporter, then schools reporter and film critic for the <em>Quad-City Times</em>, where I also covered Cary Grant’s death in Davenport, Iowa, and then I worked for the <em>San Diego Business Journal</em>, where I became an expert on the arcane America’s Cup Deed of Gift. When I moved to Washington, D.C., where I wrote about the Clinton health care reform plan and other Capitol Hill issues for an inside-the-beltway newsletter publisher, I thought I had found my true calling. Matt DeLorenzo convinced me otherwise, and I moved to Detroit in 1996 to work for <em>AutoWeek</em>. Four years later, Jack Keebler lured me to <em>Motor Trend</em>, where I wrote news and rumors about future cars, voted in a dozen (each) Car of the Year and Sport/Utility of the Year competitions, and blogged as the Motor City Blogman. Detroit is to the global auto industry what Washington is to national politics. It’s easily more fascinating and as frustrating to cover as a journalist. The commute is far more interesting. \n<br><br>\nMy years at <em>Motor Trend</em>, working side-by-side with Technical Director Frank Markus, have been enormously fulfilling. I’ve become fully immersed in the nuts and bolts of cars, and the industry. You have to keep a love for cars and driving in perspective. For me, Donna, our two collies, and my family back in Wisconsin come first. I can be nearly as passionate about politics, movies and art, and the Green Bay Packers, of which I’m a shareholder. My favorite sport is still Formula 1, though.\n<br><br>\n<em>Automobile</em> is about living with cars, both the good ones and the bad ones, but most importantly, the most interesting ones. With autonomous cars on the near horizon, we face the greatest threat to our enthusiasm since the malaise and oil embargoes of the ‘70s, the era when I earned my driver’s license. With Jean, Joe and their crew, <em>Automobile</em> already has the best, most interesting writers to explain why you should put down that mobile phone and grab the steering wheel. I’m thrilled to become part of this team and I look forward to helping place the cars and the way we drive them in context.","fileMasterId":67554677,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67554677/67554677.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2031,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"todd.lassa@automobilemag.com"},{"id":2032,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/am_lassa"}],"websiteIds":[3002,3006,10009,40064,6202044,6202059,6202060,6202077,6202083,6202085,6202090]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-27T21:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"dog-aid-homepage2","title":"nissan loves detroit dogs","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68939686/dog-aid-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":68939686,"fileName":"dog-aid-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-27T21:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"dog-aid-homepage2","title":"nissan loves detroit dogs","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68939686/dog-aid-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":68939686,"fileName":"dog-aid-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-27T21:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"dog-aid-header2","title":"nissan loves detroit dogs","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70800588/dog-aid-header2.jpg","fileMasterId":70800588,"fileName":"dog-aid-header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-27T21:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"dog-aid-homepage2","title":"nissan loves detroit dogs","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68939686/dog-aid-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":68939686,"fileName":"dog-aid-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":641023,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"You may remember “Mister K” and his “dogs love trucks” commercials for the Nissan Frontier pickup some sixteen years ago.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding.

His race report on the 12 Hours of Sebring was published when he was an eighteen-year-old Art Center student in 1954. Subsequently he has published thousands of articles on cars and airplanes, in American, Asian, English, European, and South American magazines. He contributed to several books, including the entire text of the well-reviewed <em>Auto Legends</em>, now available in five translated editions -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Polish in addition to the original English version. In 1985, <em>Automobile Magazine</em> founder David E. Davis, Jr., invited him to be one of two executive editors when <em>Automobile</em> was in the planning stages. Cumberford demurred, saying he knew nothing about magazine production and claims he still doesn’t, except that it’s important to meet deadlines. He contributed features from the beginning and began his popular “By Design” column in the sixth issue, September 1986.  \n<br><br>\nIn car design, Cumberford was even more a youthful prodigy. He sketched the body for the first car ever built to his designs when he was a fifteen-year-old Los Angeles high-school student. That car, the Parkinson Jaguar Special, is still active in historic racing sixty years after it was created. Hired directly by General Motors’ legendary Vice President of Design, Harley J. Earl, Cumberford became a professional car designer at nineteen. Leaving Detroit, he returned to California to attend UCLA to study philosophy. He rejoined the automotive world in the early 1960s and has continued to create new automotive shapes since then, always as an independent design consultant. He has lived and worked in six of the fifty United States and in France, Mexico, and Switzerland. The range of his design projects includes both racing and touring cars, trucks, aircraft, boats, hovercraft, and even ecological architecture. \n<br><br>\nHe is known worldwide for strong opinions but is well-respected in the design world because it is known that he is always completely honest in his views, with no agenda other than respect for good design and good designers. “There’s no ad hominem,” he says, “I judge the design, not the designers. There are designers I really like personally who’ve been credited with designs I heartily dislike -- for reasons I always state very clearly -- and designs I love done by people with whom I have absolutely no affinity. Except that we both like their work.”","fileMasterId":74354961,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74354961/74354961.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2022,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"rcumberford@gmail.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044,6202077]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Soapbox","id":1034787,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/soapbox","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-28T14:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"homepage","title":"memories of bertone","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70853235/homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70853235,"fileName":"homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-28T14:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"homepage","title":"memories of bertone","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70853235/homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70853235,"fileName":"homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-28T14:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"header","title":"memories of bertone","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64854905/header.jpg","fileMasterId":64854905,"fileName":"header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-03-28T14:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"homepage","title":"memories of bertone","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70853235/homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70853235,"fileName":"homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":640366,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"1967-Jaguar-Bertone-Pirana-Coupe","caption":"","fileMasterId":46228245,"fileName":"1967-Jaguar-Bertone-Pirana-Coupe-badge.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46228245/1967-Jaguar-Bertone-Pirana-Coupe-badge.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":938},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1500}},"order":0,"text":"Carrozzeria Bertone, the very last of the great Italian coachbuilders who led world car design from 1946 to circa 1986, was forced to close its doors this year, 102 years after its founding in Turin, Italy.

That is true for the Korean group that makes Hyundai and Kia cars. Peter Schreyer, a German with a distinguished past with the Volkswagen Group, was hired first to put some spark into Kia. He was so successful that he was named head of all design for both nameplates in January 2013. Fiat do Brasil has a design team headed by Peter Fassbender, another German who had extended experience in Italy. These successful professionals have taught successive generations of native designers the practices of the most competent car design departments in the world, so there is no longer any advantage for a company to go to Italian firms, as was the case as recently as the 1990s, when Peugeot and Citroën relied on Pininfarina and Bertone, respectively.

We can regret, lament, celebrate the past, but there is no foreseeable future for Italian car design.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"Bertone Alfa Romeo Pandion, 2010.","fileMasterId":26944145,"fileName":"stile-bertone-alfa-romeo-pandion-top.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/26944145/stile-bertone-alfa-romeo-pandion-top.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":469},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":750}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Pininfarina's classic Ferrari 250GT berlinetta from 1959.","fileMasterId":42040148,"fileName":"Sergio-Pininfarina-ferrari-Berlinetta-250GT.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42040148/Sergio-Pininfarina-ferrari-Berlinetta-250GT.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":938},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1500}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Italdesign Giugiaro Parcour concept, 2013.","fileMasterId":62855313,"fileName":"ItalDesign-Giugiaro-Parcour-front-three-quarters-3-623x389.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62855313/ItalDesign-Giugiaro-Parcour-front-three-quarters-3-623x389.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":389},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":623}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":46228245,"fileName":"1967-Jaguar-Bertone-Pirana-Coupe-badge.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46228245/1967-Jaguar-Bertone-Pirana-Coupe-badge.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":938},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1500}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Enzo Ferrari (left) with Sergio Pininfarina.","fileMasterId":42040145,"fileName":"Sergio-Pininfarina-and-Enzo-1966.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42040145/Sergio-Pininfarina-and-Enzo-1966.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":938},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1500}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Sergio PIninfarina.","fileMasterId":56987957,"fileName":"Sergio-Pininfarina-Studying-Car.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56987957/Sergio-Pininfarina-Studying-Car.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":938},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1500}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Pininfarina Chevrolet Corvette Rondine, 1963, by an American designer working at Pininfarina,  Tom Tjaarda.

This is the reason why, this time, we are very astonished by the many inaccuracies and false statements in his story. \n<br>\nFirstly, we are disappointed by such little respect towards the Pininfarina family. Unfounded personalized criticisms, such as the ones addressed to Mr. Andrea Pininfarina, and statements about Mrs. Lorenza, do not deserve any comments. The role of the third generation has been - and still is - central for the Company.<br>\n <br>\nUnder Paolo Pininfarina’s chairmanship, the Company is perpetuating the image of a brand that is still perceived as synonymous with excellence. Pininfarina continues to cooperate with a great number of automakers and has undertaken new collaborations expanding the range of business from automotive to boating, aeronautics, industrial design, interior design and architecture, as evidenced by the many recent successful projects in the United States, Latin America and Asia. <br>\n<br>\nThe global crisis occurred in the latest years, in particular to automotive industry, is an undeniable fact. However, the crisis did not hit only companies organized around families, as confirmed by the bankruptcy of giants like GM and Chrysler. Pininfarina has gone through difficult years as many others but continues on its path offering the world its interpretation of creativity, as borne out by the Gran Lusso created with BMW and the acquisition of new customers from among the world's top 10 car manufacturers. <br>\n<br>\nGrowth in the engineering sector has been achieved mostly in Germany and Asia, in particular in Japan and India. On the Italian market, important projects underway in collaboration with Ferrari and its Styling Centre are evidence of the strong, long-lasting ties between the two companies. <br>\n<br>\nBesides design, Pininfarina provides all-round support to automotive companies by engaging in a variety of activities: engineering, product development, testing, prototype construction. More generally, we do not share Mr. Cumberford’s opinion when he argues that \"there is no longer any advantage for a company to go to Italian firms.\" Prestigious clients such as Ferrari and BMW continue to rely on Pininfarina’s creativity. The models on display in Geneva this year showcase the role of Pininfarina as the standard bearer for the aesthetic values of Italian design in the world and strengthen the brand, the firm's true distinctive character. The new Ferrari California T, together with the F12 berlinetta, the FF and many other recent projects, are part of a history that has generated the finest cars of all times through an evolution that started over 60 years ago and shows no sign of waning. And the Gran Lusso confirms our mission not only as global designers, but also as makers of exclusive high-quality cars.<br>\n<br>\n Mr. Cumberford is right when he says that the era of coachbuilders as contract manufacturers is over. However, today Pininfarina continues to dedicate resources and talents to the creation of unique pieces, reinterpreting its artisan roots. The dream of the Ferrari Sergio is becoming true for a few collectors thanks to Pininfarina skills and experience. At our style and engineering center in Cambiano we continue, as ever, to conceive, develop and manufacture one-off models and small series.<br>\n<br>\n It's a job that is so noble and so peculiar to the Turin area. It is a return to our origins, to a niche that is fully keeping with our vision, our history. Pininfarina, in essence, is still a strategic partner with which the internal OEM styling centers continue to compete on all the proposed designs. Being considered a reference point in style is testified by the many awards received also in recent times, such as the 2012 Interior Design Award of the Year for the Cambiano, the Best Design Study 2013 for the Sergio, the GOOD DESIGN™ Award 2013 and German Design Award 2014 for the BMW Pininfarina Gran Lusso Coupè.<br>\n<br>\nDespite the “de profundis” sung by Mr. Cumberford, Pininfarina is more alive than ever. We kindly invite your readers to follow us on <a href=\"www.pininfarina.com\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.pininfarina.com</a> and <a href=\"www.facebook.com/PininfarinaSpA\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.facebook.com/PininfarinaSpA</a>. There they will see how vital our company is. Thank you very much in advance for publishing this note. <br>\n<br>\nBest regards. Pininfarina Communication Department<br></em>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":22,"text":"<h3>Robert Cumberford Responds to Pininfarina:</h3>\nSo the Pininfarina Communications Department is unhappy with me. That was to be expected. Anything less than panegyric enthusiasm always distresses them. Too bad.<br>\n<br>\nI have frequently praised designs carrying Pinin Farina and Pininfarina labels, specifically mentioning the purity, beauty, and classicism of cars made during the past eighty-three years that featured those badges, but that does not change my view of the problems visited upon Pinin’s proud house—or Nuccio Bertone’s—by the founding family’s third generation miring those companies in debt. <br>\n<br>\nIt is easy to blame “outside forces” but the bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler cited here by Pininfarina came from the same causes: incompetent management, arrogance, and unwillingness to see the world as it is, not as desired to be by those who made the bad decisions.<br>\n<br>\n\nI hope Pininfarina SpA will indeed continue to exist and prosper, but as it does so it will be under the direction and control of others, not Battista’s descendants, whatever their titles and roles in the enterprise. <br>\n—Robert

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Of course, different doesn’t have to be bad, as the Ridgeline stands out from other pickups on the market with a design that gives it the air of an SUV with a chunk missing.  It bucks another pickup tradition by being the only mid-size truck on the market with a cab and truck bed built in one piece, meaning that the sections don’t bounce around separately while driving.  This gives the Ridgeline a smoother ride than most of its rivals, while still maintaining the convenience of an open-bed truck. It is, however, significantly more expensive than many of its competitors, with a base price range in the $30,000s. The Ridgeline has a one choice of engine, a 250-horsepower V-6, and is rated to tow 5,000 pounds. Another desirable feature is the standard four-wheel drive. It has four doors and two rows of seats, so the Ridgeline can seat five, although the cabin is not appointed quite as well as the rest of Honda’s fleet. As if the Ridgeline needed any more cargo space, there is a lockable in-bed trunk with 8.5 cubic feet of storage for anything you don’t want flying around the truck bed.  Reliability and good driving character are the hallmarks of Honda vehicles, and the Ridgeline follows suit.  Opt for the Sport edition to add some welcome style to an already competent and roomy utility vehicle.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>Competitors:</h3>\r\nToyota Tacoma<br>\r\nNissan Frontier<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>Cool Tech:</h3>\nIn-bed trunk locks up your tools.<br>\nStandard rearview camera.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>Looks:</h3>\r\nHalf SUV, half truck looks like nothing else on the road.<br>\r\nBlack mesh grille on Sport model adds some flash.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>New for 2014:</h3>\r\nA new special black trimmed edition adds some much needed visual appeal.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":37450,"make":"Honda","model":"Ridgeline","year":2014},{"id":"8bfe9141-264d-3530-adde-b612c376b580","type":"mediaTag","name":"Trucks","path":"/Main/Trucks"},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"c5978325-a9dc-3f8e-a2f1-72a953d8dce9","type":"articleTag","articleType":"buyer_guide"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":6},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:13:39.403-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866019403 }} },{ "_id":490509,"title":"Motor City Masters","subTitle":"Coming soon: Our own Jean Jennings in a reality TV series.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Lunacy","id":1034778,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-lunacy","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-01T11:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"motor-city-masters-homepage","title":"ferrari ff to the spa","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65067164/motor-city-masters-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65067164,"fileName":"motor-city-masters-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":312},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":639}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-01T11:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"motor-city-masters-homepage","title":"ferrari ff to the spa","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65067164/motor-city-masters-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65067164,"fileName":"motor-city-masters-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":312},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":639}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-01T11:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"motor-city-masters-header","title":"ferrari ff to the spa","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65067167/motor-city-masters-header.jpg","fileMasterId":65067167,"fileName":"motor-city-masters-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":359},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":565}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-01T11:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"motor-city-masters-homepage","title":"ferrari ff to the spa","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65067164/motor-city-masters-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65067164,"fileName":"motor-city-masters-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":312},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":639}}},"pages":[{"id":641678,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"This website and <em>Automobile Magazine</em> generally take up enough of Jean's day, but this past month, she has added a new item to her portfolio: reality-show star.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":17086,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Simone Samano","firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Samano","jobTitle":"Writer","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"I was born a suburban Detroit gal where the preoccupation with cars is practically genetic.

Eventually my racing aspirations gave way to a long held interest in filmmaking and I got my B.A. from the University of Michigan's burgeoning film program.  U of M taught me to write and introduced me to my excellent husband.  We spent five adventurous years in Los Angeles in the entertainment and publishing industries before returning to Ann Arbor where our lovely daughter came into the world.

His race report on the 12 Hours of Sebring was published when he was an eighteen-year-old Art Center student in 1954. Subsequently he has published thousands of articles on cars and airplanes, in American, Asian, English, European, and South American magazines. He contributed to several books, including the entire text of the well-reviewed <em>Auto Legends</em>, now available in five translated editions -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Polish in addition to the original English version. In 1985, <em>Automobile Magazine</em> founder David E. Davis, Jr., invited him to be one of two executive editors when <em>Automobile</em> was in the planning stages. Cumberford demurred, saying he knew nothing about magazine production and claims he still doesn’t, except that it’s important to meet deadlines. He contributed features from the beginning and began his popular “By Design” column in the sixth issue, September 1986.  \n<br><br>\nIn car design, Cumberford was even more a youthful prodigy. He sketched the body for the first car ever built to his designs when he was a fifteen-year-old Los Angeles high-school student. That car, the Parkinson Jaguar Special, is still active in historic racing sixty years after it was created. Hired directly by General Motors’ legendary Vice President of Design, Harley J. Earl, Cumberford became a professional car designer at nineteen. Leaving Detroit, he returned to California to attend UCLA to study philosophy. He rejoined the automotive world in the early 1960s and has continued to create new automotive shapes since then, always as an independent design consultant. He has lived and worked in six of the fifty United States and in France, Mexico, and Switzerland.

Watch out for pedestrians in areas where one would least expect them to be, like busy, dimly lit thoroughfares.</h3>\nTo start, it’s commonly believed that roadways are for car, truck, and bicycle traffic.  Some disagree, and hopefully, you won’t run into those folks (literally). Case in point is my twelfth caller, who sees a pedestrian dressed in dark clothing walking in the roadway on a busy street with fast-moving traffic.  A squad was sent to check on him.  They determined this pedestrian’s demonstrated aversion to using the city’s sidewalk infrastructure meant he might not survive if left to his own devices and transported him home. Likewise, call fifty-three was about a male staggering in traffic. The guy was intoxicated, as it turned out, and decided that he was going to hail a cab by floundering around in the middle of an intersection.  Regardless of how much a person has to drink, nobody wants to see anyone come to harm via the business end of an automobile, so the police helped him get a taxi.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>2. Be alert in gas station parking lots, which serve as venues for all kinds of odd behavior, including romantic.</h3>\nMaybe it’s not shocking that roadways are not a safe place to hang out.  Would it be surprising to learn that the common gas station can also serve as a setting for unexpected mayhem and mystery?  Such was the case for my fourth caller, who found himself on the losing end of a minor brawl near the gas pumps.  He didn’t know the woman who smacked him in the face, and I got the sense that he felt embarrassed.  Still, assault is assault even if it’s a woman throwing the punches.  This incident seemed to stem from a territorial dispute over who had first dibs on that particular gas pump.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Caller sixty-one was at a different filling station, and was watching a guy in the parking lot attack a car occupied by two women.  The suspect was trying to punch out the windows with his fists.  It’s not clear if he was angry at the car or its occupants, and the story never did come to light, because both the vehicle and the guy took off before the police arrived.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Call 101 came from a gas station employee who was growing increasingly concerned about three vehicles in the parking lot of the business.  One car was sitting at the pumps for almost an hour.  Two other cars were occupied and parked in front of the store for nearly as long.  Police checked it out.  The first one was sitting at the pumps for so long because its owner accidentally locked the keys inside and walked home to retrieve a spare set.  The other two vehicles belonged to a male and female who were meeting in person for the first time after becoming acquainted online.  They chose to meet at the gas station because it was a public place where both felt safe.  The suspicious vehicles turned out to be perfectly benign, but their occupants could just as easily have been up to something, so the clerk’s vigilance and willingness to call 911 are still good in my book.\n\t\n<h3>3. Keep your hands off people inside the car or anywhere else, either.</h3>\nOf course, there are worse places to be than a gas station parking lot, and not just for first dates.  Near the top of that list would be in the back seat of a squad car on its way to jail. Call sixty-four was about an incident that generated a flurry of calls from neighbors with a one-block radius.  Information was vague, but reports indicated that people were fighting and screaming outside an apartment building.  Several people saw a Jeep on the scene, in which the driver was attempting to strangle the passenger. The next caller wanted police to know that the Jeep was speeding away even as squad cars were closing in. Cops didn’t locate the Jeep, but if they had, that driver would probably have spent the night in jail, while his Jeep would likely have been towed to impound.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>4. Hypervigilance and caution may be called for when performing even seemingly routine tasks, like walking down the street, walking to your car, or loading groceries into the car.</h3>\nThings can get much worse when weapons are brought into the mix. I've taken calls in which cars are involved as a bone of contention, as a backdrop for a murder, and as a means of escape.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"First up is caller thirteen, who reports that a man has just brandished a handgun at a woman in her eighties outside a grocery store and carjacked the woman’s aging Honda sedan. Ironically, the vehicle this suspect has chosen to take at gunpoint sports a “War Is Not the Answer” bumper sticker. The Honda most certainly went right to a chop shop, and its frame and some of its less valuable pieces, like the plastic bits, will likely turn up abandoned behind a vacant property eventually. For whatever reason, I really hope that bumper sticker survives this ordeal somehow.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"When I return from my lunch break, I learn that there has been a fatal shooting just a few blocks from where I live. This type of thing makes me especially wary of my surroundings when I pull in my driveway after work, and I scanned the call screen for any descriptions of suspects or vehicles to keep an eye out for on the drive home. Information indicated that the victim was walking to his car from a party when he was approached by a male who may have been trying to rob him.  He died in the street outside his vehicle. When paths cross between two people, one of whom is willing to put their immediate wants and fulfillment of their whims over another person’s very life, the result is a senseless thing like this. These kinds of calls make me cringe, and when they’re in my own neighborhood, they’re even scarier and more depressing than usual, because there’s always that worry that the victim could be a neighbor or friend.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"Call 109 is the last call I answer on this shift, and it’s a shooting.  The phones light up as a wave of incoming calls about this same thing hits all at once.   My caller witnessed two men shoot a third guy, who fell down to the ground.  The shooters walked away, but then turned around, walked back, and shot the third man two more times before running away.  As police were headed to the scene, a fourth man came along and dragged the shooting victim into a van, which took off.  I don’t know if the victim in this shooting ever turned up at the hospital, but it is certain that the van he was loaded into was not an ambulance.   Regardless, I hope he survived.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<h3>5.  Leaving the car running unattended may seem like a good way to warm it up, but some people interpret this to mean “Hey, free car!”</h3>\nThe victims in these calls likely couldn’t have done much to prevent what happened to them without having some kind of sixth sense.  In certain cases, though, people unwittingly fling open wide the windows of opportunity for folks with bad intentions to climb right through.  This is the case in call thirty-eight, an auto theft report.  The owner of the vehicle had what must have seemed like a good idea at the time: he started his car and left it idling and unattended to warm it up.  Turns out that car thieves are more than happy to take a joyride in a toasty warm car. Which leads me to rule number six:","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"<h3>6. Learn how to properly use (or not use) the fancy emergency technology that’s built into your car so that the vehicle doesn’t end up crying wolf to the monitoring company and the police.</h3>\nThat story above was a case of user error, you might think, but what if your car is loaded with enough technology to take care of itself and a small colony of astronauts?  Take call forty-six, for example, from a company that handles mobile dispatching for Infiniti brand automobiles. They called to have officers check on one of their vehicles in which the panic/SOS button push signal was activated.  The monitoring company was unable to get a response from inside the car, nor could they get an answer on the phone that was linked to the account.  Police located the vehicle unoccupied, locked, and completely intact.  Perhaps the driver or an occupant mashed the panic button without even realizing it?  Or perhaps this car was lonely. You be the judge.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<h3>7. An argument over car keys can sometimes escalate until police intervention is called for.  It may be best to avoid loaning out the car altogether.</h3>\nIf you can’t trust strangers or technology with your car, surely you can trust your friends, right?   Well, if call ninety-eight is any indication; you can’t.   In this instance, two women were having a very spirited argument over one loaning her car keys to the other, who refused to return them.  There was talk of escalation and profanity galore from both parties as this battle of words raged on over the phone lines.  However, when the one with the keys realized that the police really were going to come out to chat with her, the two managed to bury the hatchet.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"<h3>8.  If enough people spot you driving a car like you stole it, eventually, somebody is going to share that information with the police.</h3>\nSome people’s driving techniques are better suited for competing in a demolition derby than for commuting. Caller number ten wants to tell me about a reckless driver in an old Cadillac sedan that was swerving over lane lines and nearly striking pedestrians.  Caller sixty-seven reported a black Chevy pickup truck that was speeding and blowing through stop signs and red lights.  This kind of driving is really dangerous and puts a lot of people at risk.  In both calls, I gathered vehicle information and direction of travel, ran the license plates, then sent a message to the squads on duty so they could track down the vehicles and their drivers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"<h3>9. Drive defensively, but if you do get in a wreck, try to get a plate number, just in case the other guy takes off.</h3>\nSometimes, careless drivers leave a trail of wreckage in their wakes.  In call twenty, it’s in the form of a multiple-vehicle accident.  This mess was initiated by a black sedan that struck my caller’s Saturn, knocking it out of its orbital trajectory and shoving it, coincidentally, into another Saturn, which then hit a Pontiac parked along the side of the road.  The black sedan fled the scene, making this a hit and run.  Call twenty-nine involved two SUVs.  One of them turned into the path of the other, causing the initial collision.  The one that caused the accident then fled the scene, striking a third vehicle while fleeing.  I can relate to how my callers felt, because my own car was struck by a hit-and-run driver a few years ago on my way home from work.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"Hit-and-run calls are extremely common; enough that one’s faith in humanity would be destroyed if it hinged solely on whether or not people stayed on the scene of an accident.  Who knows if that other driver has an invalid license, lacks insurance, has active warrants, may be intoxicated, or all of the above?  Well, you don’t.  But I bet the officer answering the call does.  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":17,"text":"<h3>10. If you’re feeling lost, try going to your left.  It works for some people.  Just don’t forget to stop when you get to where you are going.</h3>\nIt’s always good to have a sense of direction while navigating through whatever city you’re in, even if you’re on foot.  Take it from the new operator sitting across the aisle from me.  I overheard him talking to one of our frequent callers: a woman who tends to drink in excess, then wander about until she’s lost downtown or gets kicked out of a business for stumbling around and pestering patrons. My co-workers and I start to worry about her if several days pass without a call from her. This call was our new guy’s first time dealing with her, and he didn’t know where to send help because she didn‘t know where she was. In the years that I’ve been taking calls from her, the only instruction I’ve ever been able to get her to follow is to walk to her left until she finds a street sign that she can read.  I advised the new guy to try this technique, and he did get a cross street out of her so she could find a corner to wait for police.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":18,"text":"Even if each of the calls we receive at 911 involved something awful (which would not be the case, thanks to accidental dials, non-emergency calls, and people who let their babies and toddlers play with the phone), the odds are still in your favor to avoid disaster.

We had picked up a brand-new 2014 GMC Terrain for our cushy ride. It proved to blend in well with all the other sport-utility vehicles and trucks in this trendy Texas town.

Instead of having to stop at the light there is a separate lane to the far right where drivers slow down and then yield as they merge into traffic. In Michigan, you can turn right on red but you need to make a complete stop first.

While they were drilling one of the test holes, the bit suddenly fell twenty-six feet, and that's how the cavern was discovered. The gift shop and ticket office looked like they were straight out of the Sixties, but once underground I was impressed. The tour guide was funny and informative. The tour took us on a one-mile loop, and at the very bottom we were more than seventy feet underground, and it was close to eighty degrees. Definitely worth the time and the $19.95-per-person fee.

The neighborhood made me nervous, but since I was with my mom, I was okay. It was actually a cabin in the back yard of an art gallery that was super cute and artsy.

It also had areas for dogs, fountains to play in, and a play area for kids. Shockingly, there were not many people in the park.

In fact, I would say the whole car exceeded my expectations.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"A little helpful information from Honda.","fileMasterId":71708151,"fileName":"Honda-Fit-Legroom.png","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/71708151/Honda-Fit-Legroom.png","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":364},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"More infographic details from Honda.","fileMasterId":69428446,"fileName":"2015-Fit-Cargo.png","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69428446/2015-Fit-Cargo.png","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":364},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":620}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Roofline spoiler is new on the 2015 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":69428485,"fileName":"Back-of-Fit.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69428485/Back-of-Fit.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":624}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"The 2015 Honda Fit is actually 1.6 inches shorter but has more interior space.","fileMasterId":69428497,"fileName":"Back-of-Honda-Fit.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69428497/Back-of-Honda-Fit.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":396},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"With the seats folded flat, the 2015 Honda Fit has tons of space.","fileMasterId":69428527,"fileName":"Fit-Back-Seat-2.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69428527/Fit-Back-Seat-2.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":394},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":624}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"CVT models get a dash-mounted Econ button to optimize transmission, engine and other powertrain elements as a fuel-saving measure.","fileMasterId":69428542,"fileName":"Fit-Front.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69428542/Fit-Front.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":623}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"There's 4.8 inches more rear-seat legroom in the 2015 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":69428536,"fileName":"Fit-Back-Seat.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69428536/Fit-Back-Seat.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":396},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":624}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"USB comes on EX and EX-L models of the 2015 Honda Fit, but everybody gets the cupholders and smartphone holder.","fileMasterId":69428545,"fileName":"Fit-Int-2.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69428545/Fit-Int-2.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Seven-inch touchscreen is standard on EX and EX-L models.","fileMasterId":71708148,"fileName":"Fit-Int-3.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/71708148/Fit-Int-3.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":8,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":623}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Sunroof with sunshade (which can be closed manually) is standard on EX and EX-L models.","fileMasterId":69428779,"fileName":"Moonroof.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69428779/Moonroof.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":9,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":417},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Honda's 2015 Fit started with a \"bullet\" design in the concept version;
