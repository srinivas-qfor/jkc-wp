I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding.

I can’t talk too much about the future – the SUV is on its way and will be ready Oct ’15, early ’16. As with any dogmatic statements, there are a lot of “buts” and “ifs” around it.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-18T04:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gmc-terrain-homepage","title":"2014 gmc terrain denali awd","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69685819/gmc-terrain-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69685819,"fileName":"gmc-terrain-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-18T04:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gmc-terrain-homepage","title":"2014 gmc terrain denali awd","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69685819/gmc-terrain-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69685819,"fileName":"gmc-terrain-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-18T04:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gmc-terrain-header","title":"2014 gmc terrain denali awd","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69685816/gmc-terrain-header.jpg","fileMasterId":69685816,"fileName":"gmc-terrain-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-18T04:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gmc-terrain-homepage","title":"2014 gmc terrain denali awd","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69685819/gmc-terrain-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69685819,"fileName":"gmc-terrain-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":666188,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"If you are in the market for a sport-utility vehicle, you've already noticed how many there are to choose from.

The Terrain is a relative newcomer, though, having made its debut for the 2010 model year, and the Denali version has only been out since 2013. To be honest, I had forgotten that the Terrain existed.

It also comes standard with a programmable power liftgate so that it can be set to open lower for vertically challenged drivers or shorter garages.

The extra power will cost a little in fuel economy but is still decent at 16 mpg city and a respectable 23-mpg highway. The Terrain Denali has dual-flow dampers that deliver a smoother ride.

I easily stuffed in a camera, two phones, a small purse, several chargers, and enough candy to birth a cavity.

We included the rear-seat entertainment system that is built into the rear of the front seats for $1,295. It seems like a must for anyone with kids, but obviously a pass for empty nesters. The trailering package adds $350,  and the cargo management package that includes luggage crossbars, a rear cargo area net, and a cover costs $235.

Driving is eating up our free time.</h3>\r\nTwo-thirds of Americans spend at least thirty minutes commuting, which is more time than they are exercising. \r\n<h3>The cure: The mind/body connection.</h3> \r\nMake the extra effort to plug in exercise before or after your journey; you’ll feel so much better. Eating a healthy diet is key.

Multitasking is common.</h3>\r\nAs the Ford survey shows, commuters do things other than drive while they're on the road. They listen to the news, radio, podcasts or e-books.

To help commuters do this, Ford has developed a Do Not Disturb feature to block calls. The idea is to let you disconnect on the way home and thereby decrease your stress levels. If you don’t drive a Ford, you can just elect to turn off your phone.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Aftermarket","id":1034783,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/aftermarket-car-parts","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-22T12:42:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driveguard-homepage","title":"bridgestone run flat tires","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69802672/driveguard-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69802672,"fileName":"driveguard-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":669},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1371}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-22T12:42:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driveguard-homepage","title":"bridgestone run flat tires","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69802672/driveguard-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69802672,"fileName":"driveguard-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":669},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1371}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-22T12:42:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driveguard-header","title":"bridgestone run flat tires","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69802663/driveguard-header.jpg","fileMasterId":69802663,"fileName":"driveguard-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-22T12:42:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"driveguard-homepage","title":"bridgestone run flat tires","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69802672/driveguard-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":69802672,"fileName":"driveguard-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":669},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1371}}},"pages":[{"id":666479,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"bridgestone run flat tires","caption":"","fileMasterId":69802675,"fileName":"driveguard-tread.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69802675/driveguard-tread.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":845},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1330}},"order":0,"text":"Do you know what to do if one of your tires blows out while you are driving?

The one caveat is that the vehicle must be equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"My mind flashed back to a recent scare with my octogenarian parents, who experienced a blowout in a remote area and were stranded until a kind motorist stopped.","type":"blockquote"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"bridgestone run flat tires","caption":"","fileMasterId":69802561,"fileName":"driveguard-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/69802561/driveguard-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2805},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":4416}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Bridgestone recently invited me to drive cars at a track to compare the DriveGuard with conventional tires.</strong> They released all of the air in the front left tire right in front of me and then told me to take a lap and to make sure I hit 50 mph.

But also remember that you are literally sitting on arguably the most important safety feature in your car: the tires. The contact patch—the part of the tire that actually touches the road—is only about the size of your hand.

It's huge.</h3> The Safety Pilot program started in late 2012 and enlisted 2,800 participants (including me) who have allowed UMTRI to install devices in their cars. Most, like mine, send and receive signals without doing anything you can see, hear, or detect from inside the car. A few are equipped to alert the driver about safety issues such as impending collisions or traffic issues. All the devices store data that researchers are using as a rich mine of information to help develop connected-vehicle technology.  From 2012 until now, these devices have collectively recorded 3.9 million trips or 24.6 million miles on the roads, and they've sent out 30 billion basic safety messages through the technology. And about 80 percent of the time when the participating cars are on the road, they've come into contact with another connected vehicle. Kind of amazing considering the small size of the participant group! But really, this whole thing is similar to, but more interesting than, the gathering of market data that Disney is looking for when it hands out those Magic Bands.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>2. It's diverse.</h3> Among the participants are six motorcycles, which ran up 4,676 connected miles from May to November last year. During that time, they encountered another connected pilot vehicle 4,376 times. They've collected useful data on kinematics and motorcyclist behavior that University of Michigan engineering students are analyzing as we speak.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"A participant about to hit the roads next week is a bicyclist. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<h3>3. It's growing.</h3> The project put out a call to grow the number of participating vehicles to 9,000. On the day an article appeared on the local Ann Arbor newspaper's website, 500 people called to volunteer. The next step is to expand the program from one part of Ann Arbor outward to all of southeastern Michigan, with a planned participant base of 20,000 vehicles.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<h3>4. It has a really important point.</h3> Mike Shulman of Ford is technical lead of the Crash Avoidance Metrics Partnership (CAMP), which is a consortium of several automakers working on connected-vehicle technology.  . \"If drivers are pretty good most of the time,\" he says, \"every once in a while, not so much, and when you aggregate over the whole population you see 32,000 fatalities.\" He notes that early estimates suggested vehicle-to-vehicle communication could help avoid 80 percent of crashes. That's a persuasive argument.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<h3>5. It's going to be complicated.</h3>\nUMTRI's Sayer says it's no good creating connected vehicles that become obsolete, noting that every device in the Safety Pilot program had to come in for at least one software update this year. \"We need something that drivers, passengers, and pedestrians are going to maintain,\" he said. <br>\n<br>\nAutomakers, through the CAMP consortium and other efforts, are working together on setting standards, test procedures, and safety requirements. Such things as retrofitting existing vehicles or selling the connected technology as an aftermarket product? That's all still up in the air. So is figuring out how the devices would be maintained and updated.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"<h3>6. It's going to be expensive to set up.</h3> Shulman commented: \"We can demonstrate a bunch of operations, but the infrastructure guys are really broke, and they've got to be convinced this is a good thing to invest their money in. Is Montana going to do this? We need the data that enables people to make those investment decisions.\"<br>\n<br>\nNHTSA is looking at the cost over a forty-year time horizon. That's some amortization table. Does the benefit outweigh the cost? The agency is slated to release a decision paper and analysis soon that should have some answers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<h3>7. It has all kinds of possibilities.</h3>  For example, UMTRI principal investigator Jim Sayer said, a couple of temperature/moisture sensors were embedded in the pavement around Ann Arbor to issue an ice formation warning. (It must have gotten quite a workout in this winter of record-setting snowstorms.) This application collected and analyzed conditions and lowered the recommended speed on the roadway in response. People are used to getting warnings from their cars and, as Shulman pointed out, it's not clear how much it will matter to the driver <em>where</em> the warning was generated, only <em>that</em> it was generated in time to get him or her out of potential trouble. And getting drivers out of trouble is what, at its foundation, this whole thing is about.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"<h3>Related story:</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/cool-tech/car-tech-news/privacy-and-your-connected-car/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy and Your Connected Car</a> April 21, 2014","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:14:04.066-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866044068 }} },{ "_id":505636,"title":"50 Years of Ford Mustangs","subTitle":"Celebrating the pony car's every permutation with the Mustang Club of America.","slug":"50-years-of-ford-mustangs","promoTitle":"50 Years of Ford Mustangs","promoTeaserSmall":"Celebrating the pony car's every permutation with the Mustang Club of America.","promoTeaser":"Celebrating the pony car's every permutation with the Mustang Club of America.","keywords":["50 years of Ford Mustangs"],"metaTitle":"50 Years of Ford Mustangs  - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["ford mustang","50 years of mustang","mustang las vegas"],"metaDescription":"50 Years of Ford Mustangs: Celebrating 50 years of  Mustang heritage with the Mustang Club of America on the original pony car's birthday.","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2014-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2014-04-24T05:00:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2014-04-21T11:57:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":true,"url":"/car-life/events/50-years-of-ford-mustangs/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[{"id":4446,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Ronald Ahrens","firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Ahrens","jobTitle":"Contributing Writer","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"When <em>Automobile</em> launched in 1986, my byline appeared on a sidebar to the cover story written by our founding editor David E. Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year.

The sewn pleats in the seat cushions were another surprise-and-delight feature. “The trim in the car would be considered out of the question for even our highest-priced Impala.” The ’68 coupe pictured here still has the lithe body, but with twin 750-cfm four-barrels, a supercharger, and nitrous, it’s a street machine in need of some fat Hoosier tires at the rear.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"\r\nThanks to Knudsen, who became Ford Motor Company president in 1968, the Mustang got pumped up and began to swagger.

As a young adult I kicked around motor-racing, training to drive while I worked at a Brands Hatch satellite in Miami.  I've been race staff at the Detroit Grand Prix, worked TV coverage of Formula 1, Indy and NASCAR and done the occasional ride and drive program.  Eventually my racing aspirations gave way to a long held interest in filmmaking and I got my B.A. from the University of Michigan's burgeoning film program.  U of M taught me to write and introduced me to my excellent husband.  We spent five adventurous years in Los Angeles in the entertainment and publishing industries before returning to Ann Arbor where our lovely daughter came into the world.  Personally, I expend a good deal of energy on K-12 public education advocacy.

Historically, four-wheel drive had been reserved for off-road vehicles like Jeeps and trucks. These heavy-duty vehicles typically weigh far more than road vehicles in order to withstand the stress, so fuel economy suffers even if mobility is improved.

The result is improved traction and reliable handling in all kinds of weather situations. Modern electronics can vary the proportion of driving force front to rear to enhance traction or simply improve fuel economy. The electronics can also vary the power delivery between the left- and right-side wheels to improve handling. Electronics can also decide when to engage based on the detection of wheel slip by a single tire. These days, AWD has become available as an option in mid- and full-size luxury cars to enhance all-weather mobility in places where the winters are hard. AWD systems are not as heavy as they once were; nor do they represent lots of momentum-sapping friction. Even so, there is usually a slight compromise in fuel economy that comes with AWD. In general, such systems are found in vehicles meant for the street, not the trail, and this goes for SUVs as well as passenger cars.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"<strong>Examples of the type:</strong> Audi A8, BMW X1, Cadillac SRX, Ford Flex, GMC Terrain, Infiniti Q70, Porsche Cayenne, Subaru Outback (pictured), Toyota RAV4, Volkswagen Touareg ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<strong>Why you'd want it:</strong> All-wheel drive gives you reassuring versatility for all kinds of road conditions in all kinds of weather.

Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-28T07:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"subaru-homepage","title":"2014 subaru wrx sti","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66306239/subaru-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66306239,"fileName":"subaru-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2809},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":5760}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-28T07:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"subaru-homepage","title":"2014 subaru wrx sti","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66306239/subaru-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66306239,"fileName":"subaru-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2809},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":5760}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-28T07:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"subaru-header","title":"2014 subaru wrx sti","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66306236/subaru-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66306236,"fileName":"subaru-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-28T07:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"subaru-homepage","title":"2014 subaru wrx sti","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66306239/subaru-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66306239,"fileName":"subaru-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2809},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":5760}}},"pages":[{"id":666812,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>Vital Stats</h3>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $27,090 (includes destination)<br>\n<strong>This car's price:</strong> $38,190 (includes destination)<br>\n<strong>EPA fuel economy:</strong> 17 mpg city/23 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>Engine: </strong>Turbocharged 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder, 305 horsepower, 290 pound-feet of torque<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed manual<br>\n<strong>Safety features:</strong> New driver’s knee airbag brings total number of airbags to seven; 2014 and 2015 models not yet tested by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or Insurance Institute for Highway Safety<br>\n<strong>Tech features:</strong> Symmetrical all-wheel drive, multi-mode dynamics control, Intelligent Drive powertrain management system with Intelligent, Sport, and Sport Sharp modes, Brembo performance brakes<br>\n<strong>Chief competitors:</strong> Audi S4, Ford Focus ST, Mitsubishi Lancer Evo GSR","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/UryqHUfPG6E?list=UUKWoLlV8-sE8zQnoWHI9qoA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<em>Subaru boxer engine graphics in video courtesy of Designory.com.</em><br>\n<h3>Key Points</h3> \n•  The WRX STI is Subaru’s performance flagship model–aimed at boy (and girl) racers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"•  The redesigned 2015 Subaru WRX  drops the Impreza name and, at the base level, reflects no price increase over the 2014 model.

And there, like your phone, is a machine that can heal itself.<br>\n<br>\n “If a car is connected,” explains Paul Hedtke, senior director of business development at Qualcomm, \"car manufacturers can gather an enormous amount of data in real time and see how the vehicle is performing under different road conditions. And then they can tweak algorithms and push changes out to the cars to alter the way the car functions. The owner doesn’t have to do anything.” <br>\n<br>\nYour car could improve as you use it. It could get the latest features, heal itself, and improve handling if it sees that it doesn’t perform well in some terrains or environments. It could get better, or at least smarter, as it ages, without you doing anything.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"Your car could improve as you use it.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Apps","id":1034780,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/car-apps","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-30T17:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"uber-homepage","title":"uber comes to ann arbor","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70040926/uber-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70040926,"fileName":"uber-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-30T17:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"uber-homepage","title":"uber comes to ann arbor","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70040926/uber-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70040926,"fileName":"uber-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-30T17:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"uber-header","title":"uber comes to ann arbor","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70040923/uber-header.jpg","fileMasterId":70040923,"fileName":"uber-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-30T17:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"uber-homepage","title":"uber comes to ann arbor","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70040926/uber-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70040926,"fileName":"uber-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":667156,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>It arrived in Ann Arbor just as the trees began to blossom, touting clean cars, clear pricing, fast service.</strong> And the best part: it was free for two weeks.

All of this gives the startup plenty of publicity, but I wanted to know more.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"I like the idea of being able to give a good rating to someone who shows up with a super clean car and a lower grade if I can tell the driver hasn't showered this month.","type":"blockquote"},{"order":4,"text":"<strong>I was immediately reassured when I learned about Uber's rating system,</strong> an interesting twist for a ride service that reminded me of Yelp.

According to the Uber blog, this fee “supports the increased costs associated with our continued efforts to ensure the safest platform for Uber riders and drivers.

I prefer the more zippy ride that the Volkswagen TDI delivers—especially matched with a manual transmission, which you can't get on the Cruze Diesel.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"<h3>Related stories:</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/cool-tech/car-alt-fuel/five-reasons-to-want-diesel/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Five Reasons You Might Want a Diesel</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Chevrolet Cruze Turbo-Diesel","fileMasterId":66546032,"fileName":"cruze-07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66546032/cruze-07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Chevrolet Cruze Turbo-Diesel","fileMasterId":66545945,"fileName":"cruze-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66545945/cruze-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Chevrolet Cruze Turbo-Diesel","fileMasterId":66546020,"fileName":"cruze-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66546020/cruze-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Chevrolet Cruze Turbo-Diesel","fileMasterId":66546023,"fileName":"cruze-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66546023/cruze-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Chevrolet Cruze Turbo-Diesel","fileMasterId":66546038,"fileName":"cruze-11.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66546038/cruze-11.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Chevrolet Cruze Turbo-Diesel","fileMasterId":66546035,"fileName":"cruze-10.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66546035/cruze-10.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Chevrolet Cruze Turbo-Diesel","fileMasterId":66545957,"fileName":"cruze-09.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66545957/cruze-09.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Chevrolet Cruze Turbo-Diesel","fileMasterId":66545954,"fileName":"cruze-08.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66545954/cruze-08.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Chevrolet Cruze Turbo-Diesel","fileMasterId":66545948,"fileName":"cruze-05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66545948/cruze-05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":8,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Chevrolet Cruze Turbo-Diesel","fileMasterId":66545951,"fileName":"cruze-06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66545951/cruze-06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":9,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":16,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:14:09.499-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866049502 }} },{ "_id":506101,"title":"Google, Where's My Car?","subTitle":"Google Now for Android automatically remembers where you parked and flags the spot.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-02T18:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-may-3-homepage","title":"the weekend windup 5 2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73515888/ww-may-3-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":73515888,"fileName":"ww-may-3-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-02T18:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-may-3-homepage","title":"the weekend windup 5 2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73515888/ww-may-3-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":73515888,"fileName":"ww-may-3-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-02T18:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-may-3-header","title":"the weekend windup 5 2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73515885/ww-may-3-header.jpg","fileMasterId":73515885,"fileName":"ww-may-3-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-02T18:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-may-3-homepage","title":"the weekend windup 5 2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73515888/ww-may-3-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":73515888,"fileName":"ww-may-3-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":667403,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"You should have your car smudged of evil <a href=\"https://autos.yahoo.com/blogs/motoramic/woman-blames-distracted-driving-on-boyfriend-s-ghost-151711815.html\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">spirits</a>, or they may distract you.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Mental Floss <a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/56484/32-car-name-origins?bypass=1\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">uncovers</a> the meaning behind car names.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I've been race staff at the Detroit Grand Prix, worked TV coverage of Formula 1, Indy and NASCAR and done the occasional ride and drive program.  Eventually my racing aspirations gave way to a long held interest in filmmaking and I got my B.A. from the University of Michigan's burgeoning film program.  U of M taught me to write and introduced me to my excellent husband.  We spent five adventurous years in Los Angeles in the entertainment and publishing industries before returning to Ann Arbor where our lovely daughter came into the world.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

As a child I would spend hours arranging toy cars in elaborate races on the living room floor, and once spent time on a vacation in France reading the owner's manual to my parents' Ford Mondeo. The first auto show I attended was in Birmingham; after moving to Michigan I began attending the Detroit auto show almost every year. I couldn't wait to take driver's ed., get my driver's license at age 16, and tirelessly polish my slightly rusty first car. <br><br>\n\nBy the time I entered the University of Michigan, I had decided I wanted to pursue journalism and began writing for the student paper. But I also had an internship at <em>Car and Driver</em>, and quickly realized that cars were the only thing I was truly interested in reporting on. After all, countless teachers and professors had passed on the wisdom that you should, \"Write what you know.\" I pursued that interest after graduation and managed to land a job at <em>Automobile Magazine</em>, just down the street from where I'd studied for the prior four years. <br><br>\n\nFast forward to today, and I've been fortunate enough to attend auto shows on three different continents. I've learned to drive sports cars like a Fiat 500 Abarth on a race track, and spent a week eking mileage out of a Nissan Leaf electric car. <br><br>\n\nAlthough I love driving new cars, one of my favorite parts of this job is having the opportunity to meet the people responsible for those cars. Whether it's the executives speaking at launches or engineers revealing tech secrets at auto shows, I love being able to get a feel for how things work behind the scenes. <br><br>\n\nThe most surprising part about this job is that I've become the de facto go-to for friends or family members who have questions or want advice about cars. Surprisingly enough, not everybody I talk to wants to buy a two-seat sports car.","fileMasterId":67554743,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67554743/67554743.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2039,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/AM_Jake"},{"id":2040,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jake.holmes@sorc.com"},{"id":2041,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/u/0/102704652534529580048/"}],"websiteIds":[3002,3005,3006,10009,40064,6202044,6202059,6202060,6202073,6202075,6202076,6202077,6202079,6202082,6202083,6202085,6202090,6202094]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T10:28:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"beaulieu-national-motor-museum-line-of-toy-cars-1","title":"Beaulieu National Motor Museum","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70385113/Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","fileMasterId":70385113,"fileName":"Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1360},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2048}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T10:28:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"beaulieu-national-motor-museum-line-of-toy-cars-1","title":"Beaulieu National Motor Museum","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70385113/Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","fileMasterId":70385113,"fileName":"Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1360},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2048}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T10:28:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"beaulieu-national-motor-museum-line-of-toy-cars-1","title":"Beaulieu National Motor Museum","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70385113/Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","fileMasterId":70385113,"fileName":"Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1360},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2048}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T10:28:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"beaulieu-national-motor-museum-line-of-toy-cars-1","title":"Beaulieu National Motor Museum","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70385113/Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","fileMasterId":70385113,"fileName":"Beaulieu-National-Motor-Museum-line-of-toy-cars-1.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1360},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2048}}},"pages":[{"id":668312,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<em>This article originally appeared on the <a href=\"http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/1405-museum-sets-new-record-for-longest-line-of-toy-cars/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> of Automobile Magazine.</em><br>\n<br>\n<strong>We spent many hours creating races and traffic jams with toy cars,</strong> but never did our exploits reach the lengths achieved by the U.K.'s National Motor Museum.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-10T08:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-homepage","title":"the weekly windup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66839024/ww-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66839024,"fileName":"ww-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-10T08:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-homepage","title":"the weekly windup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66839024/ww-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66839024,"fileName":"ww-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-10T08:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-header2","title":"the weekly windup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66839042/ww-header2.jpg","fileMasterId":66839042,"fileName":"ww-header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-10T08:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-homepage","title":"the weekly windup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66839024/ww-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66839024,"fileName":"ww-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":671958,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"the weekly windup","caption":"","fileMasterId":66839021,"fileName":"ww-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66839021/ww-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"1.

His race report on the 12 Hours of Sebring was published when he was an eighteen-year-old Art Center student in 1954. Subsequently he has published thousands of articles on cars and airplanes, in American, Asian, English, European, and South American magazines. He contributed to several books, including the entire text of the well-reviewed <em>Auto Legends</em>, now available in five translated editions -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Polish in addition to the original English version. In 1985, <em>Automobile Magazine</em> founder David E. Davis, Jr., invited him to be one of two executive editors when <em>Automobile</em> was in the planning stages. Cumberford demurred, saying he knew nothing about magazine production and claims he still doesn’t, except that it’s important to meet deadlines. He contributed features from the beginning and began his popular “By Design” column in the sixth issue, September 1986.  \n<br><br>\nIn car design, Cumberford was even more a youthful prodigy. He sketched the body for the first car ever built to his designs when he was a fifteen-year-old Los Angeles high-school student. That car, the Parkinson Jaguar Special, is still active in historic racing sixty years after it was created. Hired directly by General Motors’ legendary Vice President of Design, Harley J. Earl, Cumberford became a professional car designer at nineteen. Leaving Detroit, he returned to California to attend UCLA to study philosophy. He rejoined the automotive world in the early 1960s and has continued to create new automotive shapes since then, always as an independent design consultant. He has lived and worked in six of the fifty United States and in France, Mexico, and Switzerland. The range of his design projects includes both racing and touring cars, trucks, aircraft, boats, hovercraft, and even ecological architecture. \n<br><br>\nHe is known worldwide for strong opinions but is well-respected in the design world because it is known that he is always completely honest in his views, with no agenda other than respect for good design and good designers. “There’s no ad hominem,” he says, “I judge the design, not the designers. There are designers I really like personally who’ve been credited with designs I heartily dislike -- for reasons I always state very clearly -- and designs I love done by people with whom I have absolutely no affinity. Except that we both like their work.”","fileMasterId":74354961,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74354961/74354961.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2022,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"rcumberford@gmail.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044,6202077]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T12:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"car-design-mag-homepage","title":"italian style magazine","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66764075/car-design-mag-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66764075,"fileName":"car-design-mag-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T12:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"car-design-mag-homepage","title":"italian style magazine","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66764075/car-design-mag-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66764075,"fileName":"car-design-mag-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T12:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"car-design-mag-header","title":"italian style magazine","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66764072/car-design-mag-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66764072,"fileName":"car-design-mag-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-08T12:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"car-design-mag-homepage","title":"italian style magazine","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66764075/car-design-mag-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66764075,"fileName":"car-design-mag-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":667402,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"italian style magazine","caption":"","fileMasterId":70391434,"fileName":"car-design-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70391434/car-design-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"“We can regret, lament, celebrate the past, but there is no foreseeable future for Italian car design.” I wrote that <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/soapbox/r-i-p-carrozzerie-italiane/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> last month, and by so doing brought down the wrath of a great many interested parties who desperately want to believe all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>But, as much as I’d like for them to be correct in their rose-colored views, they aren’t.

Fulvio Cinti, now in his nineties, who retired at the end of last year as editor and administrator of the publication he had imagined, conceived, and guided for decades, was for a long time the sports editor of <em>La Stampa,</em> one of Italy’s most important daily newspapers, based in Turin, as was Fiat in its glory years.

I found a sole copy in Manhattan long ago and cherish it to this day, but the problems of production and distribution and interfering collaborators put an end to it not long after it began. <br>\n<br>\nBut Cinti bided his time, and at the end of the Seventies, he was supported in launching <em>Auto & Design</em> by a group of friends, all movers and shakers in the upper levels of Italian industry and society.

Davis, Jr., in the new adventure, she thought I might be a better fit for Cinti’s magazine. <br>\n<br>\nAnd so it turned out. Cinti and I communicate in less-than-classical French (on both sides), and we have found endless points of convergence and agreement, and some surprising connections. For instance, when the Lancia sports car racing team came to America sixty years ago for the 1954 Sebring 12 Hours race, the first time serious European racing drivers had visited our country since the Gordon Bennett races in the late Thirties, Cinti and I were both there.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"No, we didn’t meet.

That one of my pals had a Volkswagen we could drive nonstop across the U.S., and that I lived in a converted garage in the back yard of the struggling owner of a small car magazine, <em>Road & Track,</em> who wanted coverage and was willing to print my handwritten story of the race—my first-ever publication—meant that we could be in the same place at the same time, but not meet as equals.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<strong>I will never forget the first time I met Fulvio Cinti.

I say that now, but in fact they were really girls, one of them—certainly the most striking—no more than a teenager. She was statuesque, with long coal-black hair hanging well below her waist. In fact, it was cut off exactly at hem height of her (very) miniskirt.

Maria Teresa Fausto (at left in the photo below), the supposed “top model” I’d met in the Eighties, is still at <em>Auto & Design</em> twenty-six years later, responsible for handling subscriptions, back issues, and online activities. Cinti’s successor as Amministratore Unico (C.E.O.), Laura Carpaneto, is new in the post, but she is an architect whose connection with the magazine goes back to the beginning. Her father, whose shares she inherited, was one of the founding investors.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Things to Buy","id":1034789,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/things-to-buy","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-14T07:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"travel-books-homepage","title":"books to make you road trip ready","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70779277/travel-books-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70779277,"fileName":"travel-books-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-14T07:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"travel-books-homepage","title":"books to make you road trip ready","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70779277/travel-books-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70779277,"fileName":"travel-books-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-14T07:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"travel-books-header","title":"books to make you road trip ready","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67099304/travel-books-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67099304,"fileName":"travel-books-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-14T07:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"travel-books-homepage","title":"books to make you road trip ready","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/70779277/travel-books-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":70779277,"fileName":"travel-books-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":672430,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The Internet is now the go-to place to help plan a road trip.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-15T18:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pink-playboy-mustang-homepage","title":"pink car nation","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73960461/pink-playboy-mustang-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":73960461,"fileName":"pink-playboy-mustang-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-15T18:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pink-playboy-mustang-homepage","title":"pink car nation","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73960461/pink-playboy-mustang-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":73960461,"fileName":"pink-playboy-mustang-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-15T18:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pink-playboy-mustang-header","title":"pink car nation","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67150394/pink-playboy-mustang-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67150394,"fileName":"pink-playboy-mustang-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-15T18:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pink-playboy-mustang-homepage","title":"pink car nation","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73960461/pink-playboy-mustang-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":73960461,"fileName":"pink-playboy-mustang-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":672463,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Pink is a powerful mystery.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver.

She had me circle the track at speed, getting the car up to about 55 mph, until I naturally felt the need to lift off. I could feel the car begin to lose grip but corrected in time to avoid a spin. The reverse was true in another Camry that had the worn tires on the back and the new tires in front.

My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Fast Women","id":1034957,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/fast-women","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Teenagers","id":1034773,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car/teenagers","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Kids in the Car","id":1034769,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-20T13:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"landspeed-homepage","title":"land speed record","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67363598/landspeed-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67363598,"fileName":"landspeed-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-20T13:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"landspeed-homepage","title":"land speed record","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67363598/landspeed-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67363598,"fileName":"landspeed-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-20T13:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"landspeed-header","title":"land speed record","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74148582/landspeed-header.jpg","fileMasterId":74148582,"fileName":"landspeed-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-20T13:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"landspeed-homepage","title":"land speed record","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67363598/landspeed-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67363598,"fileName":"landspeed-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":672651,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>When she was four years old, Kaylin Stewart watched her father, Tom, set a land speed record</strong> at the Bonneville Salt Flats, in Utah, and resolved to race on the salt as well.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"A few weeks from now, upon celebrating her sixteenth birthday, Kaylin will begin her quest to become the youngest driver ever to join the <a href=\"http://www.bonneville200mph.org\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">200 MPH Club</a>.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-24T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"may-24-homepage","title":"the weekly windup 5 24","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67597130/may-24-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67597130,"fileName":"may-24-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-24T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"may-24-homepage","title":"the weekly windup 5 24","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67597130/may-24-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67597130,"fileName":"may-24-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-24T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"may-24-header","title":"the weekly windup 5 24","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67597127/may-24-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67597127,"fileName":"may-24-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-05-24T08:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"may-24-homepage","title":"the weekly windup 5 24","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67597130/may-24-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67597130,"fileName":"may-24-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":691380,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>1.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

The Pilot, however, falls squarely in SUV territory with its high stance, nicely tuned suspension and a serviceable five-speed V-6 that will tow up to 4,500 pounds when paired with the four-wheel drive.  Up to eight passengers can fit in three rows and still have 18 cubic feet of cargo space in the way back.  Fold the two passenger rows down and cargo space becomes nearly epic.  A recent and welcome tech upgrade brought new audio and media interfaces plus a rearview camera to modernize the driver’s experience.  Inside and out the look is pleasant but the strength of the Pilot is its utility, reliability and capable handling rather than standout styling presence.  In the asset column is that at 17 to 18 mpg in the city and 24 to 25 on the highway, the Pilot is the highest EPA-rated fuel economy for an eight passenger SUV.  Safety-wise the car is coated with high tech airbags and was rated in 2013 as an IIHS Top Safety Pick.  Expect to pay between $30,000 for the base two-wheel drive Pilot and $40,000 plus for all the bells and whistles, which will be prohibitive for some.  Neither showy nor ground-breaking the Pilot’s versatility has still won over loads of fans who will be looking forward to seeing what a 2015 redesign will add to their favorite SUV.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>Competitors:</h3>\r\nNissan Pathfinder<br>\r\nChevrolet Traverse<br>\r\nFord Explorer<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>Cool Tech:</h3>\r\nMultiple threshold airbags adjust inflation rates according to severity of impact.<br>\r\nVoice recognition allows hands free navigation.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>Looks:</h3>\r\nClean boxy look is particular to the Pilot.  <br>\r\nIntegrated hitch gives bumper a smooth appearance.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:14:29.329-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866069330 }} },{ "_id":405625,"title":"How to Get Elders to Stop Driving","subTitle":"","slug":"get-elders-to-stop-driving","promoTitle":"How to Get Elders to Stop Driving","promoTeaserSmall":"Afraid to ask your aging parents to hand over the keys?

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-19T07:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mazda-cx3-homepage","title":"Mazda Cx3 Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/78976988/mazda-cx3-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":78976988,"fileName":"mazda-cx3-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-19T07:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mazda-cx3-homepage","title":"Mazda Cx3 Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/78976988/mazda-cx3-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":78976988,"fileName":"mazda-cx3-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-19T07:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mazda-cx3-header","title":"Mazda Cx3 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/78976985/mazda-cx3-header.jpg","fileMasterId":78976985,"fileName":"mazda-cx3-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-19T07:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"mazda-cx3-homepage","title":"Mazda Cx3 Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/78976988/mazda-cx3-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":78976988,"fileName":"mazda-cx3-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":875249,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Who would want a basic small sedan after seeing the cheeky 2016 Mazda CX-3?","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Mazda Cx3 01","caption":"","fileMasterId":87616003,"fileName":"mazda-cx3-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87616003/mazda-cx3-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":1,"text":"This crossover, just introduced at the Los Angeles Auto Show, knocks your hat off with its great looks.

I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-20T08:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-hrv-homepage","title":"Honda Hrv Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/84405123/honda-hrv-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":84405123,"fileName":"honda-hrv-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-20T08:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-hrv-homepage","title":"Honda Hrv Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/84405123/honda-hrv-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":84405123,"fileName":"honda-hrv-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-20T08:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-hrv-header","title":"Honda Hrv Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87694330/honda-hrv-header.jpg","fileMasterId":87694330,"fileName":"honda-hrv-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-20T08:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-hrv-homepage","title":"Honda Hrv Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/84405123/honda-hrv-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":84405123,"fileName":"honda-hrv-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":876560,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"We have to confess our disappointment with the 2016 Honda HR-V, which was introduced at the Los Angeles Auto Show.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-25T13:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-apr25-homepage","title":"weekly windup 4 25","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73258914/ww-apr25-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":73258914,"fileName":"ww-apr25-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-25T13:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-apr25-homepage","title":"weekly windup 4 25","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73258914/ww-apr25-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":73258914,"fileName":"ww-apr25-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-25T13:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-apr25-header","title":"weekly windup 4 25","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73258905/ww-apr25-header.jpg","fileMasterId":73258905,"fileName":"ww-apr25-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-04-25T13:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-apr25-homepage","title":"weekly windup 4 25","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/73258914/ww-apr25-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":73258914,"fileName":"ww-apr25-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":666838,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"When researching the Ford Mustang on the top of the Empire State building at the New York Auto Show I stumbled over <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/automobiles/collectibles/when-cars-ruled-the-worlds-fair.html?ref=philpatton&_r=0\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> story about cars and the World’s Fair.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T12:31:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"galpin-rocket-homepage","title":"Galpin Rocket Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87799774/galpin-rocket-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":87799774,"fileName":"galpin-rocket-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T12:31:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"galpin-rocket-homepage","title":"Galpin Rocket Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87799774/galpin-rocket-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":87799774,"fileName":"galpin-rocket-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T12:31:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"galpin-rocket-header","title":"Galpin Rocket Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87799768/galpin-rocket-header.jpg","fileMasterId":87799768,"fileName":"galpin-rocket-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T12:31:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"galpin-rocket-homepage","title":"Galpin Rocket Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87799774/galpin-rocket-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":87799774,"fileName":"galpin-rocket-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":876744,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Henrik Fisker, designer of BMWs, Aston Martins, and the beautiful but ill-fated Fisker Karma, had an idea for a Ford Mustang.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Fisker also had a collaborator in Beau Boeckmann, who says his Galpin Ford dealership in Los Angeles is the nation’s largest.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Editor","Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T06:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cadillac-ats-v-homepage","title":"Cadillac Ats V Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87772609/cadillac-ats-v-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":87772609,"fileName":"cadillac-ats-v-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T06:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cadillac-ats-v-homepage","title":"Cadillac Ats V Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87772609/cadillac-ats-v-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":87772609,"fileName":"cadillac-ats-v-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T06:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cadillac-ats-v-header","title":"Cadillac Ats V Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/84485184/cadillac-ats-v-header.jpg","fileMasterId":84485184,"fileName":"cadillac-ats-v-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T06:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cadillac-ats-v-homepage","title":"Cadillac Ats V Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87772609/cadillac-ats-v-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":87772609,"fileName":"cadillac-ats-v-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":876565,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The Cadillac ATS is sweet to look at, to sit in, and to drive.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T08:28:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"acura-ilx-homepage","title":"Acura Ilx Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/79150376/acura-ilx-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":79150376,"fileName":"acura-ilx-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T08:28:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"acura-ilx-homepage","title":"Acura Ilx Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/79150376/acura-ilx-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":79150376,"fileName":"acura-ilx-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T08:28:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"acura-ilx-header","title":"Acura Ilx Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/87779467/acura-ilx-header.jpg","fileMasterId":87779467,"fileName":"acura-ilx-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-11-21T08:28:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"acura-ilx-homepage","title":"Acura Ilx Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/79150376/acura-ilx-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":79150376,"fileName":"acura-ilx-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":876561,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The 2016 Acura ILX has received significant technology upgrades and minor styling changes as Acura tries to boost its slow-selling, entry-level car.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-12-15T13:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ducati-homepage","title":"Ducati Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/80969990/ducati-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":80969990,"fileName":"ducati-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-12-15T13:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ducati-homepage","title":"Ducati Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/80969990/ducati-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":80969990,"fileName":"ducati-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-12-15T13:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ducati-header","title":"Ducati Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/80970044/ducati-header.jpg","fileMasterId":80970044,"fileName":"ducati-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-12-15T13:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ducati-homepage","title":"Ducati Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/80969990/ducati-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":80969990,"fileName":"ducati-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":879217,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Price:</strong> $8,495-$9,995<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 803cc V-twin   <br>                \t\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed sequential manual<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> USB socket for a smartphone<br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Soft saddlebags with Scrambler logo<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Antilock brakes, LED headlamp and taillamp, electronic fuel injection<br>\n<strong>Notable options:</strong> Interchangeable gas tank side panels, accessory headlamp trim ring, handlebar cross brace, dry-weather and waterproof side and tank bags\n <br>\n<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>After smoldering for forty years, the embers of a unique motorcycling passion</strong> have finally rekindled flames with the introduction of the 2015 Ducati Scrambler.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Lightweight and inexpensive, the Scrambler revives a model produced from 1962 to 1975, a Ducati street bike modified for “scrambles” races on off-road circuits.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"And indeed, as I found during the Scrambler’s press introduction in Palm Springs, California, it delivers the elemental riding experience.
