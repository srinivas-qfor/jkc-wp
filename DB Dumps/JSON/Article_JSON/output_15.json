Regardless of which model you choose, you are assured of the ability to express a glamorous, modern, or sporty aesthetic. For example, there is the new 500 Turbo that fits in between the tame 500 and snarling 500 Abarth. The battery-powered 500e, which is available in California and Oregon, offers range of more than 100 miles in urban driving and can reach 88 mph on the highway. Throughout the line, you choose between coupe or convertible with power-operated cloth top (500e not included) and work from a palette that includes some of the most fashion-forward hues in the automotive realm. Pop, Sport, and Lounge trims differentiate models even further. The Sport includes sixteen-inch wheels, aggressive body pieces, unique seats, and a powerful stereo. Besides these, the limited-production 1957 Edition invokes the Nuova 500 (New 500) that was a European smash hit back then. Cloaked in light blue, shod with matching dish wheels, and furnished within in brown and ivory leather, the 1957 Edition charmingly fulfills the mission of honoring its precursor. The 500 series represents so many things we love about cars: style, personality, economy, and performance. Like the Mini Cooper, it’s more expensive than, say, a Toyota Yaris, but you’re getting something extra special.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nSeven-inch high-definition display, Bluetooth streaming audio, additional USB port, high-definition audio, six-speed automatic transmission in the Abarth.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Fiat 500 interior","fileMasterId":103956485,"fileName":"fiat-500-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103956485/fiat-500-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Fiat 500","fileMasterId":103956428,"fileName":"fiat-500-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103956428/fiat-500-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Fiat 500","fileMasterId":103956479,"fileName":"fiat-500-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103956479/fiat-500-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Fiat 500</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/car-on-the-road/arrivederci-fiat-500/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Arrivederci, Fiat 500</a> September 18, 2013","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43596,"make":"Fiat","model":"500","year":2015},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:11.847-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866231848 }} },{ "_id":673564,"title":"2015 Fiat 500L","subTitle":"All the style of the Cinquecento with more of a body.","slug":"2015-fiat-500l","promoTitle":"2015 Fiat 500L","promoTeaserSmall":"All the style of the Cinquecento with more of a body.","promoTeaser":"All the style of the Cinquecento with more of a body.","keywords":["2015 Fiat 500L"],"metaTitle":"2015 Fiat 500L","metaKeywords":["2015 Fiat 500L; Fiat; crossover; SUV; Italian"],"metaDescription":"All the style of the Cinquecento with more of a body.

It's Fiat's attempt to update the tidy little 500 Giardiniera station wagon introduced in 1960, and it does benefit from Fiat’s innovative approach to design. The available white- or black-painted roof seems to float. Easy, Pop, and Lounge trim groups differentiate the 500L by lifestyle. The newest addition is the Trekking trim group, which suggests adventure in the way that the original Subaru Legacy Outback did. The Trekking has seventeen-inch wheels, unique rugged-looking front and rear fascia designs, flared fenders, and a black-and-brown interior.

Of course it is luxurious. And with a huge V-12 engine making 453 horsepower, it’s not pokey. Yet the Phantom strives foremost to be the ultimate statement of elegance, which Rolls-Royce has always represented. When the new Phantom appeared in 2003, the huge grille—which then seemed over the top—said it all. (Since that debut, many other manufacturers have taken the cue and heavily emphasized their brand heritage with a massive grille.) <br><br>On the Series II model that was introduced in 2012, the front was restyled, adding adaptive LED headlamps and a new bumper. At the same time, the car got an improved infotainment system with an 8.8-inch display, and semi-surround-view cameras were added. Additionally, the eight-speed automatic transmission was fitted into the drivetrain. In addition to the Phantom sedan, there’s an extended-wheelbase version for limo duties. Meanwhile, built on a shorter version of the sedan’s chassis, the Phantom Coupe is available with the Starlight headliner. The Phantom Drophead Coupe—we Americans say convertible—has a lined fabric top and optional teak deck. Overall, though, the Phantom is ready for an update in safety and driver assistance technologies, not to mention working in the infotainment features offered in Rolls’s other cars.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nNine Phantom Drophead Coupe Nighthawk Collection models were built for the U.S. market.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Rolls-Royce Phantom Nighthawk interior","fileMasterId":104024948,"fileName":"rollsroyce-phantom-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/104024948/rollsroyce-phantom-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Rolls-Royce Phantom Nighthawk","fileMasterId":104024849,"fileName":"rollsroyce-phantom-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/104024849/rollsroyce-phantom-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Rolls-Royce Phantom Nighthawk","fileMasterId":104024843,"fileName":"rollsroyce-phantom-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/104024843/rollsroyce-phantom-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":44209,"make":"Rolls Royce","model":"Phantom","year":2015},{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:12.727-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866232728 }} },{ "_id":678883,"title":"2015 Rolls-Royce Wraith","subTitle":"Like nothing else.","slug":"2015-rolls-royce-wraith","promoTitle":"2015 Rolls-Royce Wraith","promoTeaserSmall":"Like nothing else.","promoTeaser":"Like nothing else.","keywords":["2015 Rolls-Royce Wraith"],"metaTitle":"2015 Rolls-Royce Wraith","metaKeywords":["2015 Rolls-Royce Wraith; Rolls-Royce; British; coupe"],"metaDescription":"Like nothing else.

Nevertheless, for all the Wraith’s excess, it is touted as a daily driver for a younger group of buyers. Six-footers fit in the back seat, and three bags of golf clubs go in the trunk. The technology is incredible. Communication between the navigation system and the eight-speed automatic transmission means the road is analyzed to determine the right gear.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

For serious work duty, the van has multiple axle choices and, when properly equipped, can tow as much as 6,700 pounds and carry up to 487 cubic feet or 4,500 pounds of cargo. The wagon is offered in two trims, XL and XLT, and can be outfitted to carry eight, ten, twelve, or fifteen passengers. There are three engine choices, including a diesel five-cylinder and a 3.7-liter V-6 that has flex-fuel and natural gas options. There are also a variety of door setups, including either 60/40 hinged or sliding on the passenger's side, dual sliding, or 50/50 split doors in the rear. Window configurations are abundant, and fleet buyers will appreciate the option of factory-installed auxiliary switches for heavy-duty add-ons. Prices can climb quickly, especially with the addition of the $9,690 diesel engine or the $10,025 cost of increasing the gross vehicle weight rating, but the Transit is still a competitive choice.

Like a minivan, it has sliding doors on both sides, but has the option of hinged rear doors instead of the standard liftgate. Both body styles, are available in two wheelbase lengths, but while the van can only carry two people, the wagon can shuttle five or seven, in short- and long-wheelbase versions, respectively. With the rear seats folded, the short wheelbase can swallow 77 cubic feet of cargo, while the long wheelbase can transport over 100 cubic feet of stuff weighing up to 1,270 pounds. The van’s payload maxes out at 1,600 pounds and, with the appropriate fittings, can tow up to 2,000 pounds. <br><br>While the van is all business, the wagon can be trimmed in leather. Available comfort and convenience options include heated side mirrors, front and rear parking sensors, and Ford’s Sync infotainment system. Owners may also like the programmable MyKey, which allows speed and audio limits to be set for specific drivers. The van can be customized with numerous aftermarket products like bins, shelves, and partitions to create an individually tailored cargo space. There are two four-cylinder engines to choose from: a normally aspirated 2.5-liter and a turbocharged 1.6-liter; the former can be converted to use compressed or liquefied natural gas. A starting price in the low $20,000s makes the Transit Connect affordable for the smallest business.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe short-wheelbase wagon with the liftgate gets a rear cargo cover to disguise valuables in the back and Magnetic Metallic exterior paint.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Transit Connect interior","fileMasterId":106535810,"fileName":"ford-transitconnect-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106535810/ford-transitconnect-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Transit Connect","fileMasterId":106535807,"fileName":"ford-transitconnect-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106535807/ford-transitconnect-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Transit Connect","fileMasterId":106535804,"fileName":"ford-transitconnect-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106535804/ford-transitconnect-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45435,"make":"Ford","model":"Transit Connect","year":2015},{"id":"8bfe9141-264d-3530-adde-b612c376b580","type":"mediaTag","name":"Trucks","path":"/Main/Trucks"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:15.724-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866235724 }} },{ "_id":687122,"title":"Pro/Con: Leather or Cloth?","subTitle":"Molly likes her cars swathed in leather.

For example, the 2015 Ford Escape uses scrap cotton, recycled plastic bottles, and repurposed fiberglass in its insulation and carpeting. I love that kind of thing.

Making them real leather adds $750 to $2,250, depending on which leather interior you choose. Standard leather seats tend to be up in the top trim levels of a model, which is another way of paying more for a new car. When I'm the one buying, I like to stay down in the low to midrange trim levels, and that's where the cloth is.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<strong>I'm not a fanatic; I know that leather and suede or Alcantara can be delightful.</strong> I appreciate a well-made perforated-leather seat as much as anyone.

If you imagine stained beige plush when you think about fabric seats, you should look at the MB-Tex seats that Mercedes-Benz uses in the C-Class and E-Class lineups. Surprise: It is vinyl, not leather, yet I like it better than the most buttery, excessive set of leather seats you can find anywhere.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Many of them—split grille surround, houndstooth interior fabric and retro colors—emphasize the Challenger’s heritage. Others boost technology and performance. The Challenger R/T Scat Pack’s 6.4-liter V-8 produces 485 horsepower, launches the car from 0 to 60 mph in the mid-four-second range, and propels it to 182 mph. If the Scat Pack’s potential isn’t great enough, consider the Challenger Hellcat. Its supercharged, 6.2-liter V-8 produces 707 horsepower and potential outrage in Congress. Even the entry-level Challenger SXT gets 305 horsepower from its 3.6-liter V-6. <br><br>All Challengers now have new headlamps and taillamps, and the running gear is improved by the addition of an eight-speed automatic transmission (with electronic shifter) and electrically assisted power steering. Inside the cabin, the driver benefits from a new customizable TFT display instrument panel, and an 8.4-inch touchscreen is available.

The 4Runner’s exterior has been refined over the years, but it maintains a tough look. The cabin combines rugged, squared-off styling cues with more refined touches like contrast stitching on the doors. All 4Runner models now come standard with Toyota’s Entune mulitmedia system that includes satellite radio, iPod connectivity, and Bluetooth, and on Limited models, access to mobile apps and data services. Old friends of 4Runners gone by will be happy to see the base SR5 comes with fog lights, skidplates, roof rails, and other off-road-ready gear. The 4Runner’s hatch can hold 47.2 cubic feet of cargo and up to 89.7 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. Go ahead and spring for the more versatile 4x4, since the added pounds have only a marginal effect on fuel economy.

Exclusive ambient interior lighting, aluminum scuff plates, and heated rear seats dress up the cabin of the top Limited model. There is also a full suite of safety and driver assistance systems available, the most interesting being a so-called Smart Stop system that overrides unintended acceleration.

The XLE model comes standard with leather and offers a Select package with premium audio, navigation, and connectivity functions as well as safety aids like blind spot monitoring.

To simplify the Highlander model line—and presumably to also reduce production costs—Toyota offers no options on its first two trim levels. Instead the LE comes with nice standards like eighteen-inch alloy wheels, touchscreen display, third-row seating and more. Next up is the LE Plus that adds on conveniences like a power liftgate, three-zone climate control, and an eight-way power driver’s seat that includes lumbar support. If you want a moonroof, you’ll have to move up to the XLE, Limited, or Limited Platinum. There are two Limited packages available on both the standard and hybrid Highlanders. Depending on which package you choose, tech helpers like blind spot monitoring with cross traffic alert, a rear parking sensor, pre-collision system, and emergency assistance are available, some as options. The base four-cylinder does its best to get the family around town, but for a zippier feel or for towing the maximum 5,000 pounds, you’ll want the V-6 or hybrid models.

The Land Cruiser only comes in one trim, but you won’t be disappointed: among the features are heated and ventilated front seats, an eight-inch infotainment display, a rear entertainment system, and a cooler box. A third row is also included, pushing seating capacity to eight. It can be split and folded flat to either side of the cargo area to allow for increased cargo space, although not as much as other vehicles where the third row disappears into the floor. The 5.7-liter V-8 eagerly rises to any occasion and allows the Land Cruiser to tow up to 8,500 pounds. As you might expect, fuel economy isn’t great: it gets a scant 13 mpg in the city but improves to 18 mpg on the open road. Adventurous types will like the Multi-Terrain Select system that allows the driver to choose one of several settings to match the current road or off-road conditions. For $81,475, it’s a little disappointing to see faux wood decorating the interior in this otherwise well-appointed sport-utility vehicle.

Over the years, the vehicle lineup has been expanded and now includes four distinct models that vary in size and propulsion type. The regular Prius is powered by a 1.8-liter engine supplemented by a battery-powered electric motor that achieves 44/40 mpg city/highway. The plug-in version of this body style adds a lithium-ion battery that can be charged externally and used to operate the vehicle in electric mode for a limited number of miles at speeds of up to 62 mph. It achieves 95 mpg-e or a combined rating of 50 mpg. The third variant, the Prius c, uses the same hybrid powertrain as the standard Prius but is nearly twenty inches shorter, starts at about $5,000 less, and averages 53 mpg in the city. And it comes in colors more vivid than a bag of jellybeans. Then there’s the Prius v, which is basically a stretched, wagon version of the Prius with a roomier rear seat and almost thirteen cubic feet of additional cargo space under the rear hatch. <br> <br>All Prius models have multiple safety extras like driver’s knee and side curtain airbags, vehicle proximity notification, plus the Star Safety System that enhances braking ability, traction, and stability. An available moonroof even has a solar panel component to power a heat-venting system while parked. For all the high-tech amenities available, the interior remains rather sparse in feeling. The digital instrument display is nestled so deeply in the dash that it’s a bit challenging to read at a quick glance. None of the members of the Prius family are known for high-performance qualities, but with so many other great qualities, one of the Prius family cars might be just right for you.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nA Special Edition gets its own seventeen-inch wheels, unique interior materials and features, and two exclusive exterior color choices.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Prius interior","fileMasterId":103945415,"fileName":"toyota-prius-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103945415/toyota-prius-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Prius","fileMasterId":103945469,"fileName":"toyota-prius-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103945469/toyota-prius-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Prius","fileMasterId":103945412,"fileName":"toyota-prius-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103945412/toyota-prius-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":44159,"make":"Toyota","model":"Prius","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45611,"make":"Toyota","model":"Prius Plug-In","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45339,"make":"Toyota","model":"Prius V","year":2015},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:19.502-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866239503 }} },{ "_id":687564,"title":"2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata","subTitle":"The world’s favorite sports car.","slug":"2015-mazda-mx-5-miata","promoTitle":"2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata","promoTeaserSmall":"The world’s favorite sports car.","promoTeaser":"The world’s favorite sports car.","keywords":["2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata"],"metaTitle":"2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata","metaKeywords":["2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata; Mazda; Miata; convertible; sports car; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"The world’s favorite sports car.

There is one rather modest engine available, a 2.0-liter four-cylinder. That engine produces 158 horsepower when mated to the six-speed automatic transmission and 167 horsepower with the manual. Fuel economy is not great, the cabin can be a tight fit, and there is almost no room in the trunk, but practicality is not the point of this car. All you need to do to understand the Miata is point it down a curvy road and take it on a brisk drive. There are few cars on the market that deliver the kind of simple driving pleasure at which the Miata excels.\n<br><br>\nOpening the canvas soft top is a simple, one-handed affair—all you have to do is release the center latch and fold the top back behind the seats. There is also an available retractable hard top for the Club and Grand Touring models that can be raised or lowered in just twelve seconds.   \n<br><br>\nThe affordable Sport model delivers the same kind of driving pleasure as the uplevel trims, but you’ll have to sacrifice one gear in its standard manual transmission, as it gets a five-speed rather than the six-speed manual that comes with the Club and Grand Touring models. The Club gets sporty front and rear fascias, cruise control, a shock tower brace to increase front-end rigidity, and seventeen-inch wheels. The Grand Touring adds heated leather-trimmed seats and has an available premium package that gets you keyless entry and ignition, xenon headlights, and Bluetooth connectivity. But all those details are beside the point. No matter which Miata you drive, whether it has a manual or an automatic, a soft or hard top, in any trim level, once you hit the open road you’ll realize why this is the world’s favorite sports car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\n25th Anniversary edition, Sport model’s soft-top is now canvas rather than vinyl.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata interior","fileMasterId":115019501,"fileName":"mazda-mx5miata-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115019501/mazda-mx5miata-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata","fileMasterId":115019456,"fileName":"mazda-mx5miata-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115019456/mazda-mx5miata-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata","fileMasterId":115019495,"fileName":"mazda-mx5miata-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115019495/mazda-mx5miata-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":42127,"make":"Mazda","model":"Miata","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:19.840-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866239841 }} },{ "_id":687562,"title":"2015 Mazda CX-9","subTitle":"Aging gracefully.","slug":"2015-mazda-cx-9","promoTitle":"2015 Mazda CX-9","promoTeaserSmall":"Aging gracefully.","promoTeaser":"Aging gracefully.","keywords":["2015 Mazda CX-9"],"metaTitle":"2015 Mazda CX-9","metaKeywords":["2015 Mazda CX-9; Mazda; crossover; sport-utility; SUV; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"Aging gracefully.

Built on the platform of the previous-generation Ford Edge and not redesigned since its 2007 debut, the Mazda CX-9 is nevertheless a viable three-row alternative to a minivan. With 139.4 cubic feet of total passenger volume, the cabin is spacious enough for seven passengers to ride in relative comfort. Or, if you need to haul cargo rather than people, it’s easy to fold the multi-configurable second and third rows flat, resulting in a generous 100.7 cubic feet of cargo space.\n<br><br>\nDespite its age, the CX-9 looks modern and sporty, thanks to a face-lift a couple of years ago. And, like every vehicle from the “zoom zoom” carmaker, the CX-9’s styling is matched by its handling, with agility and precision that are uncommon for this class of vehicle. The only engine is a refined 3.7-liter V-6 that produces a generous 273 horsepower. That power is put to the ground through a smooth and responsive six-speed automatic transmission.\n<br><br>\nAny of the three trim levels—Sport, Touring, and Grand Touring—can be specified with either front- or all-wheel drive and come well equipped. Options include such items as a touch-screen navigation system, a rearview camera, heated seats, and an eleven-speaker audio system. The cabin is well made but not remarkable and the 5.8-inch screen is a bit small for such a large vehicle, but wind noise is kept to a minimum, making this crossover a great long-distance highway cruiser.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe CX-9 carries over from 2014 with only two changes: a new accessories package and a new paint color called Titanium Flash Mica.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda CX-9 interior","fileMasterId":115016174,"fileName":"mazda-cx9-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115016174/mazda-cx9-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda CX-9","fileMasterId":115015853,"fileName":"mazda-cx9-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115015853/mazda-cx9-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mazda CX-9","fileMasterId":115016171,"fileName":"mazda-cx9-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115016171/mazda-cx9-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45118,"make":"Mazda","model":"CX-9","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:20.078-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866240079 }} },{ "_id":687544,"title":"2015 Mazda CX-5","subTitle":"A practical crossover that’s fun to drive.","slug":"2015-mazda-cx-5","promoTitle":"2015 Mazda CX-5","promoTeaserSmall":"A practical crossover that’s fun to drive.","promoTeaser":"A practical crossover that’s fun to drive.","keywords":["2015 Mazda CX-5"],"metaTitle":"2015 Mazda CX-5","metaKeywords":["2015 Mazda CX-5; Mazda; crossover; sport-utility; SUV; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"A practical crossover that’s fun to drive.

With seating for up to five people, the CX-5 offers a spacious interior and 34.1 cubic feet of cargo room behind the second row. That capacity expands to 65.4 cubic feet when the second row (which can also be split 60/40 or 40/20/40, depending on trim level) is folded.\n<br><br>\nBesides being spacious, the CX-5’s interior is well designed and functional, with soft materials on the door trim and upper panels plus accents of piano black and satin-finish chrome. The gauges are well placed and easy to decipher, and the three-spoke steering wheel has controls from which you can easily adjust the cruise control and audio systems. The elevated driving position is welcome in heavy traffic, and the seats—power adjustable in Touring and Grand Touring models—are comfortable and supportive.\n<br><br>\nThe two available engines mirror those in the compact Mazda 3: a 155-horsepower 2.0-liter and a 184-horsepower 2.5-liter. Both four-cylinder engines perform well in the smaller, lighter Mazda 3, but we’d opt for the 2.5-liter with the 350-pound-heavier CX-5. There will be a small sacrifice in fuel efficiency (about 1 mpg), but the extra power will be welcome when merging and passing.

Its platform was stretched, and both the passenger volume (99.7 cubic feet) and cargo capacity (14.8 cubic feet) increased, although the 6 remains slightly less spacious than most of its competitors. \n<br><br>\nDespite its larger size, the Mazda 6 exhibits the lively handling of a smaller car. Its 184-horsepower, 2.5-liter four-cylinder isn’t overly powerful, but it is responsive and returns excellent fuel economy—up to 40 mpg on the highway when paired with the automatic transmission and i-ELOOP, a regenerative braking system that converts the car’s kinetic energy to electricity when the driver lets up on the accelerator. The engine can be paired with either a six-speed automatic transmission or a six-speed manual. The downside of this sportier handling is that the Mazda 6’s ride isn’t quite as plush as that of some of its competitors, but we think the compromise is worth it.\n<br><br>\nEven the base (Sport) model comes well equipped, with seventeen-inch wheels, a tilt-and-telescope steering wheel, cruise control, and power accessories. Moving up to the Touring model gets nineteen-inch wheels, blind spot monitoring, dual-zone climate control, and premium upholstery, among other amenities. The Grand Touring gets all of the above plus unique nineteen-inch wheels, leather, an eight-way heated power driver’s seat with lumbar adjustment, and LED running lights.

That is no longer true. Case in point: the Mazda 3. The 3 is Mazda’s best-selling vehicle in the United States, and while it sits as the low end of the brand’s model line, it now offers features like pushbutton start, a rear-view camera, power seats, and multimedia connectivity, which were previously reserved for more upscale models.\n<br><br>\nWhat is even more important, though, is that the Mazda 3 is fun to drive. With excellent acceleration, a balanced suspension, and sharp steering and braking, the Mazda 3 is among the most enjoyable compact cars to drive on a day-to-day basis. The 155-horsepower, 2.0-liter and 184-horsepower, 2.5-liter engines can be paired with either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic. You’ll get slightly better mileage with the automatic, but the manual offers you the chance to have the kind of interactive driving experience that an automatic just can’t match. For maximum fuel efficiency, Mazda offers an optional i-ELOOP regenerative braking system that converts the car’s kinetic energy to electricity as soon as the accelerator is released.\n<br><br>\nThe Mazda 3 is available as either a four-door sedan or a four-door hatchback. There are four trim levels, each of which is preceded by an i (2.0-liter) or an s (2.5-liter), depending on the engine. The sedan has a sizable 12.4-cubic-foot trunk, but for maximum cargo flexibility opt for the hatchback, which has 20.2 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats, and 47.1 cubic feet with the back row folded flat.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nA manual transmission can now be paired with the 2.5-liter engine.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Chalk up the attraction to the variety of trim and engine choices that the Accord offers in a reliable, roomy package. Choose your powerplant from the sensible four-cylinder to a more powerful V-6 to those ultra-green plug-in or two-motor hybrids. The manual V-6 coupe has drawn compliments for driving fun, but for conservative types a six-speed automatic or continuously variable transmission are available.  nteriors have been freshened up to give the center stack a more integrated look over previous models, but with a buffet of buttons, screen displays, and controls, the items on the dash can seem almost too plentiful. Still, many drivers will appreciate all the available technology in the form of a media touchscreen and a navigation system, as well as driver assist options. Select Econ mode, which comes standard on the Accord, to save fuel.  Opt for the new Honda Lane Watch to monitor those cars that sneak up alongside you, or avoid punting the rear end of the car in front of you, with the forward collision warning system. To add to its practical appeal, the Accord is a Top Safety Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Trying to be all things to all people means the Accord does lack flair in the style department, but that shouldn’t bother those seeking a solid, capable commuter or family sedan that won’t let them down.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>Competitors:</h3>\r\nFord Fusion<br>\r\nNissan Altima<br>\r\nToyota Camry<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>Cool Tech:</h3>\r\ni-MMD Hybrid continuously cycles between two motors, gas and electric, to maximize fuel economy.<br>\r\nHonda Lane Watch can be set to come on automatically when you hit your turn signal.<br>\r\nGrade Logic Control system adjusts transmission to adapt to road conditions.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>Looks:</h3>\r\nCenter stack is less bulky and has improved material quality.<br>\r\nNew exhaust tips add some flare to the rear end view.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>New for 2014</h3>\r\nAdditional non-plug-in hybrid model is added for 2014.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":36138,"make":"Honda","model":"Accord","year":2014},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:27.625-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866247625 }} },{ "_id":486256,"title":"2014 Honda CR-V","subTitle":"An SUV for the long haul.","slug":"2014-honda-cr-v","promoTitle":"2014 Honda CR-V","promoTeaserSmall":"An SUV for the long haul.","promoTeaser":"An SUV for the long haul.","keywords":["2014 Honda CR-V"],"metaTitle":"2014 Honda CR-V - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["2014 Honda CR-V","Honda"],"metaDescription":"2014 Honda CR-V: An SUV for the long haul.

Redesigned in 2012 and starting in the neighborhood of $24,000, the CR-V has been known for delivering safety and respectable gas mileage but without some of the trendier style attributes of its rivals. The CR-V offers 1,500 pounds of towing capacity and 37 cubic feet of cargo space even with the rear seats up, giving it plenty of room for errands around town or family road trips.  The engine has spirit, and the car’s steering and handling are assets, especially for its size. Honda didn’t do much to change the CR-V’s interior or exterior styling when it recently overhauled the vehicle, but that might be because the existing model worked fairly well.  One of the issues Honda should look to address in the future is the level of road noise.  It’s not quite enough to scare off buyers, but after living with the car for a while drivers will tire of the persistent outdoor sounds that bleed into the cabin.  And although the CR-V has intuitive controls, the navigation system could use an update.  Standard on every CR-V you’ll find one-pull fold-flat seats and a rearview camera, Pandora interface, and Bluetooth HandsFreeLink.  Owners of old CR-Vs will appreciate a lighter all-wheel-drive system that not only conserves fuel but also helps with tire slip. Don’t expect to customize your new CR-V too much.

The 2014 model carries the crossover torch with a more SUV-like body highlighted by larger foglamps, new wheels, wider rearview mirrors, and chrome accents that give it a more aggressive presence overall.  It’s lower to the ground like a car but has a high seating position for visibility, a feature especially important in a vehicle with a swooping rear end that cuts down on some of the greenhouse real estate in back.  To feel even more secure when backing out of the driveway, all Crosstours now come with a standard rearview camera.  Pick from two engine choices, a five-speed four-cylinder automatic or a paddle-shift-equipped six-speed V-6, and there are also front-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive models to consider. Crossovers seek to tick a lot of users' boxes, and this one delivers great handling as well as an enviable 25.7 cubic feet of cargo space, and that’s before folding the 60/40 split rear seats down nearly flat. The interior is comfortable with good headroom, the stack and dash are neatly arranged ,but like its Accord sibling there is a certain panache lacking. Tech and driver assist options aplenty make up for the pedestrian interior, and count on Honda safety features to come standard. The Crosstour is more fuel efficient than earlier iterations, with Honda reporting that the two-wheel-drive I-4 achieves 22 mpg for city driving and delivers up to 31 mpg on the highway. Now that it has finally squeaked into the over-30 mpg-club, followers of the brand will be more attracted than ever to this most distinctive Honda.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>Competitors:</h3>\r\nSubaru Outback<br>\r\nToyota Venza<br>\r\nVolvo XC70<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>Cool Tech:</h3>\nThe EX-L V-6 model is also available with real time four-wheel drive.<br>\nActive head restraints adjust forward to protect the neck in a rear-end collision.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>Looks:</h3>\nBeefier exterior gives a nod to the sport utility category but retains carlike accessibility.<br>\nUpholstery choices are predictable in a grayish ivory or black leather and black or ivory fabric.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>New for 2014</h3>\r\nRefresh came last year so changes are minimal.

With a variety of engines ranging from a turbocharged four-cylinder to a rip-roaring 550-horsepower supercharged V-8, there is an XF to suit the tastes of just about any luxury-car buyer. \n<br><br>\nThere are six trim levels in the XF lineup. The well-equipped 2.0T Premium, which is the least expensive XF, comes with more standard features than last year’s base model, including navigation, a rearview camera, and front park assist. There are two V-6 models, the luxurious Portfolio and the more aggressive Sport, which both come in at $58,170 and are the only two XFs available with all-wheel drive.  At the top of the model range sit the V-8-powered XFs: the 5.0 Supercharged, the XFR, and the XFR-S. All come with Jaguar’s 5.0-liter supercharged V-8, but it is tuned differently for each application. The V-8’s power output escalates from 470 hp in the 5.0 Supercharged to 510 hp in the XFR and tops out at 550 hp in the limited-production XFR-S, which can reach 60 mph in a blistering 4.4 seconds. \n<br><br>\nAll XFs have JaguarDrive Control, through which the driver can select a setting that adjusts the engine response, transmission shifts, and dynamic stability control intervention.

Compared with its more austere and clinical German rivals, the cabin of the XJ is a feast for the senses. But the XJ is not only about luxury.

However, even the “base” XJ isn’t lacking in either luxury or performance. Its supercharged V-6 hardly feels underpowered, and all-wheel drive is a useful option (and one that can only be had with the V-6). However, if power is your thing, either of the supercharged V8s will deliver it in spades.\n<br><br>\nAll XJs have JaguarDrive Control, through which the driver can select a setting that adjusts the engine response, transmission shifts, and dynamic stability control intervention. There are three drive modes: Normal, for everyday driving; Dynamic, for a more sporting character; and Winter, which enhances handling in low-grip conditions. \n<br><br>\nThe XJ has a long list of standard options, including automatic stop/start for enhancing fuel economy, a rearview camera, a blind-spot monitor, and soft-close doors. An 8-inch touchscreen display for accessing the climate controls, audio, and navigation systems also comes standard. It is serviceable but is not as advanced or intuitive as the systems in the XJ’s luxury competitors.\n<br><br>\nDespite that last niggle, it’s hard to argue against the XJ, a sedan that delivers luxury accommodations and a dose of driving panache.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"\r\n<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThere are no mechanical changes to the XJ for 2015.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Jaguar XJ interior","fileMasterId":111177239,"fileName":"jaguar-xj-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111177239/jaguar-xj-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Jaguar XJ","fileMasterId":111177176,"fileName":"jaguar-xj-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111177176/jaguar-xj-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Jaguar XJ","fileMasterId":111177173,"fileName":"jaguar-xj-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111177173/jaguar-xj-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Jaguar XJ</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/at-home/2015-jaguar-xjl-portfolio-awd/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Jaguar XJL Portfolio AWD</a> April 28, 2015 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/style/why-paul-loves-his-2002-jaguar-xj/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Why Paul Loves His 2002 Jaguar XJ</a> May 28, 2014","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43166,"make":"Jaguar","model":"XJ-Series","year":2015},{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:28.794-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866248795 }} },{ "_id":685706,"title":"2015 Jaguar XK","subTitle":"A last blast for Jaguar’s grand tourer.","slug":"2015-jaguar-xk","promoTitle":"2015 Jaguar XK","promoTeaserSmall":"A last blast for Jaguar’s grand tourer.","promoTeaser":"A last blast for Jaguar’s grand tourer.","keywords":["2015 Jaguar XK"],"metaTitle":"2015 Jaguar XK","metaKeywords":["2015 Jaguar XK; Jaguar; coupe; convertible; British"],"metaDescription":"A last blast for Jaguar’s grand tourer.

In addition, Jaguar is producing a special edition of the XK called the Final Fifty, with performance upgrades and special styling touches.  There will be 50 Final Fiftys built (no surprise, that), 25 convertibles and 25 coupes. The only available color is Ultimate Black. \r\n<br><br>\r\nEvery two-plus-two, rear-wheel-drive XK comes with a powerful V-8 engine. The base XK get a normally aspirated V-8 with a substantial 385 horsepower. The V-8s in the XKR and XKR-S models are supercharged and produce an even more substantial—a blazing fast—510 and 550 horsepower, respectively. In any XK, all you need to do is stomp on the accelerator pedal to give yourself a thrill ride. However, what the XK really excels at is grand touring. Find a twisty road, roll down the windows or lower the convertible top (which can be accomplished in 18 seconds), and savor the pure fun of being behind the wheel. On the other hand, if that twisty road happens to be the Nürburgring or a racetrack, you can really go for it, especially if you’re in the XKR-S, which reaches 60 mph in a scant 4.2 seconds and tops out at more than 180 mph.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLike all Jaguars, the interior of the XK can be outfitted in a variety of veneers and leather furnishings, all of which are of top-notch quality and deliver the luxury you would expect.  The touch-screen interface isn’t as advanced or as user-friendly as what you’ll find in other luxury marques, but it works well enough. In addition, the “plus two” accommodations are cramped—we’d suggest limiting occupants to a driver and one passenger, and leaving the back seat for storage.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"\r\n<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nTrim levels have been simplified, and standard equipment and option packages have been reconfigured.

Stepping up one level to the F-type S gets you the same V-6 but with 40 more horses, 19-inch wheels, larger brakes, an active sport exhaust, and Dynamic Launch Mode for track days.

At the very top of the F-type range is the new R coupe, whose supercharged 550-hp V-8 will power to 60 mph in a scant 4.0 seconds. The R coupe’s interior is trimmed with faux-carbon-fiber accents, a flat-bottom steering wheel, and metal brake and accelerator pedals. \n<br><br>\nYou may have noticed that there are only two pedals, but wait for 2016, when a six-speed manual will be available, though only on V-6 models with rear-wheel drive. Yes, all-wheel drive will also be an option for 2016.\n<br><br>\nAll of that doesn’t mean that you should wait for the 2016 models, though. The 2015\nF-type is a top-notch sports car that handles with precision and is a blast to drive. One word of warning—all that handling comes courtesy of a fairly stiff suspension that can knock you around a bit on uneven pavement, but we think that’s a sacrifice worth making.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe Jaguar F-type is available as a coupe for 2015.

No, we’re not talking about muscle cars from Detroit. But the 2015 Aston Martin Vantage is up to those same tricks. It’s a good strategy for an older car. While forever beautiful, the Vantage is showing its age. Crinkles around the eyes, you know. The newest model, the Vantage GT, is the least expensive, starting at $102,525. It pays tribute to Aston’s racing heritage by wearing any of five multicolor schemes ranging from subtle to loud. Like every other Vantage, it’s available as a coupe or roadster. And like all other Vantage V8 models, it’s offered with a six-speed manual or seven-speed automatic, which can be operated via paddle shifters. And then there’s the amazing V12 Vantage S. The seven-speed is the only transmission here. We plopped into a Roadster on a beautiful autumn day, noted the weave of the carbon fiber shift paddles sparkling in the sun, savored the fragrant leather. Docking the beautiful glass “key,” we heard the dual exhausts deliver a message from Jove. As on the more expensive Vanquish, the beautifully lined convertible top operated quickly and without fuss. Driving the car over country roads made us forget all the world’s bad news, freed us from all that is coarse and mundane. There may be newer cars and more exciting technology, but the Vantage V12 Roadster will deliver an unforgettable experience with every drive.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nVantage GT coupe and roadster with six-speed manual or seven-speed automatic pay tribute to Aston Martin’s racing heritage while bringing down the entry-level price by about $20,000.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Aston Martin V12 Vantage S","fileMasterId":119408213,"fileName":"aston-martin-vantage-01-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119408213/aston-martin-vantage-01-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Aston Martin V12 Vantage S","fileMasterId":119408345,"fileName":"aston-martin-vantage-01-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119408345/aston-martin-vantage-01-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Aston Martin V12 Vantage S","fileMasterId":119408339,"fileName":"aston-martin-vantage-01-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119408339/aston-martin-vantage-01-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45707,"make":"Aston Martin","model":"V8 Vantage","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":39636,"make":"Aston Martin","model":"V12 Vantage","year":2015},{"id":"641bb9a2-17a1-3cc9-9585-5bd8468fcc24","type":"mediaTag","name":"Indulgence","path":"/Main/Indulgence"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:30.234-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866250235 }} },{ "_id":673502,"title":"2015 Aston Martin Vanquish","subTitle":"Fine stitching and indulgence.","slug":"2015-aston-martin-vanquish","promoTitle":"2015 Aston Martin Vanquish","promoTeaserSmall":"Fine stitching and indulgence.","promoTeaser":"Fine stitching and indulgence.","keywords":["2015 Aston Martin Vanquish"],"metaTitle":"2015 Aston Martin Vanquish","metaKeywords":["2015 Aston Martin Vanquish; Aston Martin; British; Coupe; convertible"],"metaDescription":"Fine stitching and indulgence.

This helps to reduce weight (the coupe’s is 3833 pounds), which helps to result in excellent handling and acceleration: 0 to 60 mph in 3.6 seconds and a top speed of 201 mph. A new eight-speed automatic transmission smoothly handles the output. There are three selectable driving modes: normal, sport, and track. With all this performance capability, many cars would clobber you with harsh ride responses, but not so the Vanquish: in fact, the Volante thinks its always tip-toeing along in a parade with Miss Strawberry Festival balanced on the rear cowl. (And it’s very quiet inside when the multilayer cloth top is raised.) Aston Martin offers 100,000 ways to configure the interior, including—yikes!—lime-green stitching, and what with choosing the body colors and wheels, well, your computer could crash.

The roofline and fenders have a purity that is risked by the repetition of polygons all over the car, including the interior, but ultimately the design holds together. Under the rear glass sits a revised, more powerful, 610-horsepower version of the 5.2-liter V-10. It’s now mated to a superb seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, which replaces the Gallardo’s slam-bang sequential semi-automatic six-speed.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-21T08:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-tc-promolarge","title":"Scion Tc Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/118060481/scion-tc-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":118060481,"fileName":"scion-tc-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-21T08:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-tc-promolarge","title":"Scion Tc Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/118060481/scion-tc-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":118060481,"fileName":"scion-tc-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-21T08:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-tc-header","title":"Scion Tc Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/118060550/scion-tc-header.jpg","fileMasterId":118060550,"fileName":"scion-tc-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":950411,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Scion Tc 05","caption":"","fileMasterId":118060577,"fileName":"scion-tc-05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/118060577/scion-tc-05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, two-door hatchback<br>\n<strong>Price:</strong> $20,164 (includes destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.5-liter four-cylinder, 179 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed manual transmission<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 23 mpg city/31 mpg highway <br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> 6.1-inch touchscreen audio<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Panoramic tilt and slide moonroof, LED front bumper accent lighting, remote keyless entry, Bluetooth connectivity, Smart Stop technology <br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Only option is carpeted floormats and cargo mat ($184) <br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> 2015 Ford Focus SE Hatchback ($19,785); 2015 Hyundai Veloster ($18,825); 2015 Kia Forte Koup EX ($19,515); 2015 Mazda 3 iSport Five-Door ($19,765)","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>It is an interesting fact that people with the least money to spend on a car</strong> are often the people who are most excited about getting their hands on one.

You’d expect a car with a price (including destination charge) of $20,164 to have a monochromatic and heavily plasticized interior, and you would be right because so many of them do. This one doesn’t. Toyota spent a lot of energy on the molding, the surfacing, and the shading of materials. The door trims are carved, with concave pieces that add shadow and light, not just straight black plastic. There’s a pebble-embossed dash trim that’s vaguely reminiscent of carbon fiber, adding depth and patterning. Plenty of entry-level cars have far less attention paid to making the most of inexpensive materials. It looks good here.

There’s a decent amount of power available from a stop as well as for merging onto the freeway or passing.

This is the car that rewards you for great success, and it also rewards the grandchildren, who will find the tiny backseat a fun novelty.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe DB9 Carbon Edition.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Aston Martin DB9","fileMasterId":119397992,"fileName":"aston-martin-db9-01-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119397992/aston-martin-db9-01-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Aston Martin DB9","fileMasterId":119397866,"fileName":"aston-martin-db9-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119397866/aston-martin-db9-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Aston Martin DB9","fileMasterId":119397863,"fileName":"aston-martin-db9-03-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119397863/aston-martin-db9-03-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:34.371-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866254372 }} },{ "_id":673501,"title":"2015 Aston Martin Rapide S","subTitle":"The fastest shape in the esses.","slug":"2015-aston-martin-rapide-s","promoTitle":"2015 Aston Martin Rapide S","promoTeaserSmall":"The fastest shape in the esses.","promoTeaser":"The fastest shape in the esses.","keywords":["2015 Aston Martin Rapide S"],"metaTitle":"2015 Aston Martin Rapide S","metaKeywords":["2015 Aston Martin Rapide S; Aston Martin; British; sedan"],"metaDescription":"The fastest shape in the esses.

There’s no denying it has sedanlike (or even minivanlike) amenities, namely, eight air bags and rear seat entertainment including video screens. No matter the label, it’s a gorgeous thing, and when you behold one parked in front of your resort hotel, you’ll wish it were yours. <br>The Rapide S is improved for 2015. The V-12 engine now makes 552 horsepower—that’s 18-percent better—and mates with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The car shoots from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds and reaches 203 mph. The even more advanced stability control adjusts for whatever pushbutton driving mode—normal, sport, or track—is selected. In typical Aston Martin fashion, the options for individualizing the car are nearly overwhelming, so you can choose colors, trim, wheels, and finishes just as you’d like. Then, to ensure that no one else’s Rapide S duplicates yours, specify the optional, personalized door sill plaques and use your nickname.

In the SE, Sport, and Limited, expect the 2.4-liter four-cylinder. The Eco has its own 1.6-liter four-cylinder and returns excellent fuel economy. Turbocharging makes the 2.0-liter four-cylinder something of a beast in the Sport 2.0T and Limited 2.0T. And the Hybrid models have a unique 2.4-liter four-cylinder that’s coupled with an electric drive system and lithium-ion battery pack. <br><br>Each model is carefully distinguished from the others. The Sonata Sport, for instance, has a blacked-out grille, flared rocker panels with integrated chrome moldings, and seventeen-inch alloy wheels. The Sport 2.0T and Limited 2.0T wear eighteen-inch alloy wheels and say good-bye through quad exhaust tips. Designers found a distinct look for the Hybrid, with a chrome bar above the black grille; low-drag wheel covers visually represent efficiency. Feature content is generously doled out.

But the Santa Fe Sport really lives up to its name when it’s equipped with the available direct-injection, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that churns out 265 horsepower. The 2.0T has eighteen-inch wheels, and nineteen-inchers are available. There are three options packages, available with either trim level. The Popular Equipment package includes heated front seats, a 4.3-inch touchscreen, and rearview camera. The Premium package adds leather upholstery and appointments, lane-change assist and blind spot detection with rear cross-traffic alert, and Proximity Key entry with push-button start. The Tech package includes rear parking assistance, a heated steering wheel, cooled front and heated rear seats, a heated steering wheel, and an eight-inch screen. The very desirable hands-free liftgate is also included. The Ultimate package offered only with the 2.0T has nineteen-inch wheels, HID headlamps and LED taillamps, and a premium audio system. Electronic chassis controls include selectable steering effort and a smart all-wheel-drive system with active cornering control. Towing capacity is 2,000 pounds for the Sport and 3,500 pounds for the Sport 2.0T. Hill start assist and downhill brake control help to manage the load. This year, improvements to the electrically assisted power steering along with a slightly stiffened suspension enhance the drivability.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her.

Quick lesson: 4G is the fourth-generation data technology for cell service, and the LTE is a version of 4G (the initials stand for Long Term Evolution). It is ten times faster than the previous generation, and the OnStar hardware is 100 times faster than the previous version.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Everything about the 911 has become more civilized in the last fifty years, but it has remained true to its sports car roots. There are seemingly innumerable variations of the 911 to appeal to enthusiast drivers of all stripes. It can be had as a hard-top coupe, a soft-top convertible (Cabriolet), or a retractable roof coupe (Targa). It comes in rear- or four-wheel drive, and its six-cylinder engine can be either normally aspirated or turbocharged. All 911s (except for the two-seat, track-focused GT3) are two-plus-twos—which comes in handy when ferrying small children or a set of golf clubs—but this sports car is really most comfortable with no more than two passengers. \n<br><br>\nThe base model is the rear-wheel-drive 911 Carrera, powered by a 350-horsepower, 3.4-liter six-cylinder engine. The 911 Carrera 4 is virtually identical to the base model, except with all-wheel drive. Moving one step up the model chart to the Carrera S and Carrera 4S gets you a 3.8-liter engine that makes 400 horsepower. Power improves incrementally from there, topping out at a truly impressive 560 horsepower in the 911 Turbo S. There are two available transmissions, a seven-speed manual and a seven-speed PDK automatic. Sadly for those who prefer a three-pedal setup, the PDK is the only transmission in the three highest-end 911s: GT3, Turbo, and Turbo S. (Porsche argues that the PDK is faster than a manual, and therefore the right choice for its highest-performance models. We beg to differ.)\n<br><br>\nThe 911 starts at a little more than $85,000 and comes with a fair amount of standard equipment, including bi-xenon headlights, rear parking sensors, heated mirrors, dual-zone climate control, leather upholstery, navigation, and Bluetooth. Be careful when selecting options, as Porsche is notorious for its hefty fees for add-ons—$4,000 plus for the PDK automatic, $8,500 for ceramic composite brakes, several thousand dollars for various interior finishes. They even charge you $300 for putting the name of the car on the doors. In other words, you’ll be hard-pressed to leave the dealership with a 911 that costs less than six figures. \n<br><br>\nHowever, that cost is about the only thing that might dampen your enthusiasm for the 911, a car that, even fifty years on, is the very definition of sports car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nThe 430-horsepower 911 GTS is added to the lineup for 2015, as is an optional rearview camera.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Porsche 911 interior","fileMasterId":115619486,"fileName":"porsche-911-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115619486/porsche-911-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Porsche 911","fileMasterId":115619483,"fileName":"porsche-911-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115619483/porsche-911-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Porsche 911","fileMasterId":115619480,"fileName":"porsche-911-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115619480/porsche-911-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":40763,"make":"Porsche","model":"911","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:37.012-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866257013 }} },{ "_id":688242,"title":"2016 Volvo XC90 T6 AWD","subTitle":"Safety, luxury, and Swedish modern style, all rolled into one go-anywhere package.","slug":"2016-volvo-xc90-t6-awd","promoTitle":"2016 Volvo XC90 T6 AWD","promoTeaserSmall":"Safety, luxury, and Swedish modern style, all rolled into one go-anywhere package.","promoTeaser":"Safety, luxury, and Swedish modern style, all rolled into one go-anywhere package.","keywords":["2016 Volvo XC90 T6 AWD"],"metaTitle":"2016 Volvo XC90 T6 AWD - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Volvo XC90","2016 Volvo XC90","Volvo crossover","Volvo sport-utility vehicle","Volvo SUV"],"metaDescription":"Safety, luxury, and Swedish modern style, all rolled into one go-anywhere package.","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2015-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2015-06-01T14:12:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2015-05-21T14:12:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":false,"url":"/you-auto-know/car-buying/2016-volvo-xc90-t6-awd/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Say what? Right. Volvo moves from using eight different engines across its line to only two—one gasoline and one diesel—sharing 50 percent of their parts. The XC90 does not get the diesel in the U.S., but its gasoline engine (mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission) produces a highly adequate 316 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque, wants premium fuel, and delivers 20 mpg in city driving and 25 mpg on the highway. The gasoline engine is both supercharged and turbocharged, taking care of moving the fairly heavy (4,627 pounds) all-wheel-drive XC90 off the line from a stop, and giving you reasonable passing power. Nothing crazy here, other than that Volvo is convinced we Americans (who, it says, spend an average of 23 days a year commuting) don’t really need big engines. “We have moved the saved money into the cabin,” says Michael Fleiss, vice-president of powertrain engineering, late of Bentley and Volkswagen.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"Can you say “Autonomous cars”?

Volvo already boasts auto braking functions to prevent collisions with cars, bikes, and pedestrians. It now adds auto braking at intersections when the driver turns in front of an oncoming car.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Road Trips","id":1034777,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-road-trips","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-06-02T07:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gurney-promolarge","title":"Gurney Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/92392681/gurney-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":92392681,"fileName":"gurney-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-06-02T07:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gurney-promolarge","title":"Gurney Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/92392681/gurney-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":92392681,"fileName":"gurney-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-06-02T07:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"gurney-01","title":"Gurney 01","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/120640220/gurney-01.jpg","fileMasterId":120640220,"fileName":"gurney-01.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":952619,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>If you have business at Dan Gurney’s <a href=\"http://allamericanracers.com/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">All American Racers</a> in Santa Ana, California,</strong> and you haven’t been there in a while, you will still find it to be the world’s finest tribute to the life and times of Daniel Sexton Gurney.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Lunacy","id":1034778,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-lunacy","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-06-02T09:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevrolet-spark-promolarge2","title":"Chevrolet Spark Promolarge2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/120659003/chevrolet-spark-promolarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":120659003,"fileName":"chevrolet-spark-promolarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-06-02T09:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevrolet-spark-promolarge2","title":"Chevrolet Spark Promolarge2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/120659003/chevrolet-spark-promolarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":120659003,"fileName":"chevrolet-spark-promolarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-06-02T08:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevrolet-spark-14","title":"Chevrolet Spark 14","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/120658850/chevrolet-spark-14.jpg","fileMasterId":120658850,"fileName":"chevrolet-spark-14.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":952716,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Chevrolet Spark 16","caption":"","fileMasterId":120708905,"fileName":"chevrolet-spark-16.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/120708905/chevrolet-spark-16.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>What I drove this weekend—a 2015 Chevrolet Spark minicar—</strong>began as a shock to my overindulged automotive journalist sensibilities.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Let me begin by saying that I had just spent a week behind the wheel of a 2016 Infiniti Q70L, the veritable lap of luxury.

You do that by finding the little yellow icon of a person at bottom right of your screen, then dragging it over to the place you want to see up close.  Now that you are viewing the location in Street View, look at the top left corner of the screen; if you see a clock face icon, click on it to see images from past Street View image sweeps of the location.

The Model S, a battery-electric vehicle, combined an unprecedented level of innovation, technology, design, and quality when it was fresh out of the box. Indeed, this American luxury sedan with a rear-mounted motor driving the rear wheels matched up well in style and pace against the European competition. But for 2015, Tesla has addressed some opportunities and achieved a worldwide first for production vehicles. To improve performance, a second motor, placed in front and driving the front wheels, is available. With 691 horsepower and all-wheel drive, the P85D whooshes from 0 to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds, achieves a top speed of 155 mph, and cruises as far as 253 miles. The P85D sits atop the range, which includes the Model S 70D and Model S 85, named for their 70- and 85-kilowatt-hour batteries supplying current to a 329- and 362-horsepower motors, respectively. The fourth model is the 85D, which benefits from the dual-motor layout but has a milder attitude with 422 horsepower; nevertheless, it will also go 155 mph. Besides hot-rodding the Model S, Tesla shows a unique twist on active safety with the available Autopilot, an artificial intelligence application that permits hands-free lane-keeping, changing of lanes, and parking. Software updates add new capabilities to the system. The Model S has a gorgeous, spacious interior with the ultimate in touchscreens, a seventeen-incher that will dazzle your passengers. And the shapely body includes features like “zero profile” door handles that recede into their housings; the P85D has a charge port in the left rear that automatically opens when it senses a charging connector’s proximity. The Model S is a breakthrough car that just keeps getting better.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"The P85D sits atop the range, which includes the Model S 70D and Model S 85, named for their 70- and 85-kilowatt-hour batteries supplying current to a 329- and 362-horsepower motors, respectively.

This year, improvements to the electrically assisted power steering along with a slightly stiffened suspension enhance the Santa Fe’s drivability. Front- or available all-wheel drive with 5-, 6-, or 7-passenger, three-row configuration are the choices for this crossover. Electronic chassis controls include selectable steering effort, now with a firmer Sport setting, and a smart all-wheel-drive system with active cornering control. The 6-passenger setup has two captain’s chairs instead of the standard 40/20/40 split-folding and reclining middle-row bench; this setup is only offered as part of the Ultimate package, available with either GLS or Limited trim. The Premium package for the Santa Fe GLS adds such conveniences and luxuries as Proximity Key entry with pushbutton start, leather upholstery, and the hands-free power liftgate. Navigation and a heated steering wheel and rear seats, as well as cooled front seats, are included in the GLS Ultimate package. The Limited Ultimate throws in HID headlamps, LED tail lamps, and a killer 12-speaker audio system. Under the hood in all trim levels is the direct-injection 3.3-liter V-6 that produces 290 horsepower. Clamp on a trailer hitch, and the Santa Fe will tow up to 5,000 pounds.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

About once a month, and definitely before leaving on a road trip, use a tire pressure gauge and make sure you have the right amount of air in your tires. The maximum pressure will be printed on the doorjamb of the driver’s door, and also on the front of the tire itself, near where the tire meets the wheel. Check tire pressure early in the day on cool tires; pressure will go up with heat, giving an inaccurate reading. Using a tire pressure gauge is easy; take the valve cap off each tire, place the gauge onto the stem, and press down until the tire stops hissing and you get a reading from the gauge, either on a bar or a digital screen. Make it a habit.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>3. Manage the spare situation.</h3> Many cars these days have either a small temporary spare or no spare tire. That’s a nod to the fact that tires are less likely to fail than they used to be; in fact, 85 percent of spare tires never get used at all. But....do you want to be out on an unfamiliar highway without a change of tire this summer? Probably not. Make sure you have at least a temporary spare on board, and get it checked to make sure it will work in a pinch. Even better, practice changing the tire so you know how. (And make your household’s teenage drivers do the same, if you have them.) If you have a temporary spare, read the directions. Usually you shouldn’t drive more than 50 mph and no more than 50 miles on it if you do have to use it. It’s really just to get you to a place where you can get a full-size tire put back on.
