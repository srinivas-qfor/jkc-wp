Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-07-25T14:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 lincoln mkz","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56418471/lincoln-mkz-header.jpg","fileMasterId":56418471,"fileName":"lincoln-mkz-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-07-25T14:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 lincoln mkz","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56418471/lincoln-mkz-header.jpg","fileMasterId":56418471,"fileName":"lincoln-mkz-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-07-25T14:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 lincoln mkz","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54087097/lincoln-mkz-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":54087097,"fileName":"lincoln-mkz-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":516310,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>The Car:</h3>\n<strong>Price:</strong> $51,205 as tested (including destination charge)\u2028</br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.7-liter V-6\u2028</br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed automatic</br>\u2028\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 18 mpg city/26 mpg highway</br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Push-button shift\u2028</br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Inflatable rear seatbelts\u2028 ($195)</br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Audi A4, Buick Regal, Cadillac CTS, Lexus ES350\u2028</br>\n</br>\nSee more specs on the MKZ in our <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/lincoln/mkz/\" title=\"\"  target=\"_blank\">Car Guide</a>.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>What I Think:</h3>\nIt has been almost sixteen years since I have really taken notice of a Lincoln.

The Lincoln brand has plummeted, and Cadillac is on the upswing in sales. However, Lincoln has repositioned itself as the Lincoln Motor Company, and the new MKZ is poised to give Cadillac a reason to keep its eyes on the rearview mirror.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2013 lincoln mkz","caption":"","fileMasterId":56418531,"fileName":"lincoln_mkz_05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56418531/lincoln_mkz_05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":2,"text":"The MKZ was completely redesigned for 2013, including all-new choices in available engines.

Every time I drove it, I discovered another feature that made me slowly fall in love. The standard push-button transmission kept me on my toes—I constantly reached for the windshield wiper control stalk as I tried to switch from park to reverse to drive. But with time, I grew fond of the buttons and how they were seamlessly designed into the center console.

I have heard complaints from fellow automotive journalists about how difficult the MyFord Touch system is to use, but I found the Lincoln version intuitive and user-friendly.

On the plus side, it costs the same as the gasoline-engined version. It also gets 45 mpg both in the city and on the highway.

I did find the road noise a little distracting, and I pondered whether it was the tires, the glass roof, or possibly a combination of both. Speaking of the panoramic roof, it blocks a good portion of the back window when in the fully open position,  but I think it is worth it.

There's plenty of technology, some unique features (like the push-button shift), and the interior is comfortable and attractive. But I couldn't get over the price. Options accounted for just about a quarter of the price of this vehicle, and while I loved the panoramic sunroof and the driver assistance technology (including active park assist, lane keeping system, and adaptive cruise control), I'm not sure I loved the prices.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

It frequently shows the famous filling up their vehicles in Hollywood. Among those shown with their Bentleys: David Beckham, Sylvester Stallone, Ludacris, and Lisa Vanderpump from <em>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.</em><br>\n• On a classier level, the Bentley has long been the ride of queens. Queen Elizabeth II, who is celebrating her sixtieth year on the throne, has a state Bentley estimated by the voracious British media to be worth more than $15 million. It was a gift from the automaker on the occasion of Her Majesty’s Golden Jubilee, in 2002. Curiously, that car stalled this January as the queen was leaving a church service at Sandringham.<br>\n• It’s not unusual for this to be a chauffeur-driven vehicle.<br>\n• The elephant in the room with the Bentley? The V-8. An exclusive British car like the Bentley typically comes with twelve cylinders.<br>\n• You could argue that the V-8 is a more respectable choice. For one thing, it doesn’t squander as much fuel: 14/24 mpg is decent for a luxury convertible, even if the Continental doesn’t escape the gas guzzler tax. Plus, it saves the customer probably close to $20,000 to choose a Bentley with a V-8 as opposed to a W-12.<br>\n• Power is not an issue: Bentley says the V-8 engine sprints from 0 to 60 mph in less than five seconds and has a top speed of more than 180 mph.<br>\n• Huge amounts of optional creature comforts are on board, including massaging front seats, wonderful deep pile carpeted floor mats, and embroidered Bentley headrests. In fact, there are sixteen options or packages on the Bentley I drove, which added up to $36,410 over the base price of the car.<br>\n• The super rich can go beyond even these substantial option choices and create a one-of-a-kind Bentley Continental GTC. Have a favorite lipstick or handbag? All you have to do is let the Bentley artisans borrow it to create a custom exterior shade to match.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"Bizee is not quite as posh as Queen Elizabeth's corgis, but she'll do.","fileMasterId":54468400,"fileName":"bentley_gtc_12.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54468400/bentley_gtc_12.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"A few rides for my friends.","fileMasterId":54468358,"fileName":"bentley_gtc_11.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54468358/bentley_gtc_11.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":36149,"make":"Bentley","model":"Continental GTC","year":2013},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:09:04.247-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865744249 }} },{ "_id":379356,"title":"Toyota & Lexus Design Contests","subTitle":"","slug":"toyota-lexus-design-contests","promoTitle":"Toyota & Lexus Design Contests","promoTeaserSmall":"You've got till 8/16 to design a Lexus IS.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-02T12:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"decoding your vin","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55345630/vin-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":55345630,"fileName":"vin-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-02T12:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"decoding your vin","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55345606/vin-header.jpg","fileMasterId":55345606,"fileName":"vin-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-02T12:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"decoding your vin","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55345612/vin-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":55345612,"fileName":"vin-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":517214,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"No math required, but I am going to be hurtling numbers at you, so be prepared to duck.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-06T08:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 mini cooper s roadster","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55625080/mini-roadster-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":55625080,"fileName":"mini-roadster-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-06T08:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 mini cooper s roadster","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55625122/mini-roadster-header1.jpg","fileMasterId":55625122,"fileName":"mini-roadster-header1.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-06T08:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 mini cooper s roadster","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57299781/mini-roadster-homepage-copy.jpg","fileMasterId":57299781,"fileName":"mini-roadster-homepage-copy.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":517301,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>The Car:</h3>\n<strong>Price:</strong> $35,345 as tested (including destination charge)</br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Turbocharged 1.6-liter inline four-cylinder, 181 horsepower</br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed automatic with paddle shifters</br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 26 mpg city/34 mpg highway</br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Semi-automatic convertible roof</br> \n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Mini Wired package, including voice command, navigation, Bluetooth, and USB/iPod connectivity ($750)</br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Audi TT, Fiat 500, Mazda MX-5 Miata, Volkswagen Eos<br>\n<br>\nSee more specs on the Mini Cooper in our <a href=http://www.jeanknowscars.com/mini/cooper/ target=\"_blank\">Car Guide.</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2013 mini cooper s roadster","caption":"","fileMasterId":55360342,"fileName":"mini_roadster_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55360342/mini_roadster_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":1,"text":"<h3>What I Think:</h3>\nI think everyone in America would agree that the Mini Cooper S Roadster is cute.

Options on the Premium model include heated front seats (Comfort package, $650) and navigation (Electronics package, $2,340). The V6 models get their power from a 305-horsepower V-6 engine.

The interior wouldn’t pass muster in any other $37,000 car; it’s a study in black plastic. The $1,595 Recaro sport seats may keep driver and passenger from sliding around on tight corners, but they’re not particularly comfortable or attractive.

The interior of the 2014 Mustang GT has kept the candle burning for the original aesthetic, so much so that I think I can still smell smoke in the air. But, since the 2005 redesign, Ford has been honing this thoroughly modern Mustang. The choice of speedometer and rpm dials perfectly incorporates the design cues of the car's forefathers. I regret that I did not get to drive it at night to see them glow. The massive black dash seems sort of cheap in comparison with some modern materials that are available to designers, but I appreciate the nod to the old-school style.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Fast Women","id":1034957,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know/fast-women","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[{"articleId":341607,"name":"article0","promoImage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-31T09:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"mean jeans humiliation","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47181580/MeanJean-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":47181580,"fileName":"MeanJean-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"promoTeaser":"I don't mind being beaten on the autocross circuit by a girl.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[{"articleId":226904,"name":"00","promoImage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-01-11T10:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Fiat Lust","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46223934/Fiat-Lust-300.jpg","fileMasterId":46223934,"fileName":"Fiat-Lust-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":299}},"promoTeaser":"Now divorced, children older, a mother of three ponders her next car.","title":"Fiat Lust: Part 1","url":"/you-auto-know/car-buying/fiat-lust/"},{"articleId":337494,"name":"article0","promoImage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-06T12:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Fiat Lust","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44003132/Fiat-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":44003132,"fileName":"Fiat-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"promoTeaser":"It's time to shop seriously for a 500: I find myself looking daggers at other women driving them.","title":"Fiat Lust, Part 2: My Shopping List","url":"/you-auto-know/car-buying/fiat-lust-part-two-shopping-list/"},{"articleId":342884,"name":"article0","promoImage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-09T13:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"fiat lust part three test drives","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46786790/fiat3-promoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":46786790,"fileName":"fiat3-promoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"promoTeaser":"Did the road lead back to the 500?","title":"Fiat Lust, Part 3: My Test Drives","url":"/you-auto-know/car-buying/fiat-lust-part-3-my-test-drives/"}],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-13T07:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"fiat lust part 4","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56261518/fiatlust-4-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":56261518,"fileName":"fiatlust-4-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-09T13:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"automoblox rescue vehicles","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55910698/fiatlust-4-header.jpg","fileMasterId":55910698,"fileName":"fiatlust-4-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-13T07:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"fiat lust part 4","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57887715/fiatlust-4-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":57887715,"fileName":"fiatlust-4-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":532561,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<em>My story began in the winter with <a href=http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/fiat-lust/ target=\"_blank\">Part One, </a>when I first started considering whether I could justify replacing my Honda Odyssey with a Fiat 500.

In less than a week, he had picked his make (Toyota), model (Camry Hybrid), accessories (none), named his price (low), and taken delivery. Exceptional efficiency, driven in part by necessity, given that his engine had fried, but I suspected that there was more to it than that. I suspected pragmatism, and I asked how he ordered food at a restaurant. “I look at the menu, decide what I want, and order.” Wow. It’s that simple?! If only…  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Restaurant patrons fall into two categories: the determined and the deliberative. The determined make their dining decisions with startling ease, and, often, food is fuel for them, not an experience. The deliberative (you know who you are) pore over the menu, ponder, ask questions, ruminate, ask more questions, deliberate further, and then—finally—decide, often on what seems an arbitrary whim. If the decision doesn’t hit the spot, regret overshadows the meal. If the decision is spot on, the dining experience is beyond divine. The deliberative require patience. Their waiters, I might add, deserve a rather generous tip.  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"You can imagine, then, what it is like for a deliberative to make a car decision, particularly with such a myriad of possibilities of models, accessories, and color combinations. Apparently, being deliberative is a characteristic of Fiat customers.  “You are a special breed,” my saleswoman, Corky, cried on my fourth visit. “I’ve got six of you who have been trying to make a decision for over two months!”  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"I liked to believe that I was just doing things in the slow, contemplative Italian way, employing the careful consideration with which one might approach a languorous meal in the Tuscan countryside. A friend of mine shattered my dreamy Italianate fantasy by rather bluntly suggesting that my inability to decide on a vehicle and my excuses of being too busy with work and children to focus on my purchase paralleled my apparent excuses of why I couldn’t start dating. Perhaps I had a fear of commitment?  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Fear of commitment seems a little harsh, but she was on to something. I have never engaged in a purchase of this magnitude on my own before. It seemed extravagant, so I was hesitant. Moreover, on top of my general deliberative nature, trepidation of an extra financial burden certainly weighed on my mind. However, the rise in gas prices in May and June and the subsequent $300 I spent on fuel for my Honda Odyssey each month, coupled with the fact that the Odyssey was tripping over 170,000 miles, spurred me into action. Extravagance became necessity.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>Which Fiat 500?</h3>\nThe first step required deciding between the new Fiat 500L and the traditional 500. On an intellectual and practical level, the 500L had real appeal. Intellectually, the factors that drove the design—Cinquecento history and modernist aesthetic—spoke to my academic sensibility. Practically, the design fits my life—it has four doors and can easily seat five with plenty of room for bags, groceries, and even our Bernese mountain dog. It is fun to drive, although one does have to hope Fiat works on the comfort of the seats in future models. Clearly, the 500L was the sensible choice.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"As functional and quirky as the 500L is, however, it simply did not speak to me the way the Cinquecento did. Twice I went to the dealership to test drive a 500L and a 500, trying to convince myself that I wanted the 500L. No matter how I wished it, the 500L did not evoke that sense of association with <em>La Dolce Vita</em> so dear to me that the Cinquecento did. If emotion is not supposed to drive car purchasing decisions, I have spectacularly failed the test. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h3>Back to the Dealer</h3>\nSo there I was with three children in tow, once again, to see if they could all fit in a Cinquecento. We took a number of spins, changing seats along the way. My eldest, Sarah, is presently the tallest; she staked out her front seat privilege immediately. Her brother, Nico, however, will soon be little in birth order only, a fact he gleefully announced with a wicked glimmer in his eye. My youngest and smallest child, Stephanie, ever the sly diplomatic one, extolled the comfort and benefits of the back seat. Maybe Sarah and Nico should both consider its excellent features, like the headrests, and, since Stephanie is the smallest, she could sit up front with the seat pulled forward and there would be plenty of room for both of them in the back!  With thoughts of the 500L in the back of my mind, I reasoned that the times all four of us will drive around town will be limited. Plus, their seat negotiations will provide me no end of amusement. The Cinquecento was the way to go.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"Back at the dealership, Corky and I sat down to discuss the financial realities. She, too, is in the unenviable club of having been through a bitter divorce. As a female sales associate in an automobile dealership, she is a woman making it in a world still dominated by men. We are both women who work long hours to provide as best we can for our children, and in their own way, our respective associations with Fiat represent the new lives we are each building. I certainly felt that gender played into the reception I had at the dealerships of other brands in a negative way. I like to believe that I would have gotten a Fiat regardless, but the fact that my salesperson was a woman in a position not unlike my own certainly added to my comfort with the decision.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"When I explained how my credit rating took a hit during some financial machinations during the separation, she understood the implications on a larger level and immediately called in the finance manager so we could review all the options. My decision to get a Fiat was more than an issue of reducing fuel costs; it was also becoming a means to restoring my financial foundations—an unexpected bonus.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<h3>Financial Decisions</h3>\r\nShould I lease or should I buy? I had intended to lease, but I wanted to review the implications of both options. With a lease’s lower monthly payment, my debt-to-income ratio would be lower. Leasing it was. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"What about pricing? Many employers and associations enable preferred pricing—automatic discounts with verification of employment. It is astounding how many people in Ann Arbor are not aware of preferred pricing programs, which save not only money but also hassle on negotiations. It’s always worth checking. What were my possibilities: university association? Chrysler’s Friends program? We went through the options and identified the best program for me.

Suddenly, as if on cue, we heard the sound of an engine starting and an exclamation from a vehicle inside the showroom: “I didn’t know it would do <em>that</em>!\" We looked over to see my twelve-year-old grinning sheepishly, holding a key. He had been amusing himself with the Abarth videos at the video terminal and had hopped into one in the showroom to see what they were like. The previous customer had been testing out the key functions; Nico wanted to see the dash lights in action. Mental note: when I actually come to purchase a specific car, leave the children at home.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"Dealer incentives—these are the lucky lottery elements of Fiat purchasing.   They are fleeting, coming and going at a moment’s notice. Some are model specific, such as for the Pop; some are regional; some are seasonal. There are incentives for leasing and purchasing, and with them, the savings can be significant. With incentives in play, could they run numbers on the different models? I wanted to be sure of my options. Patience being a part of Fiat sales, Corky agreed and laughed as she said, “I’d hate to see you in a restaurant!” Little did she know…","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"<h3>Finding the One</h3>\r\nArmed with my pricing information, I then needed to narrow down to the model and color. I run a benevolent dictatorship in my house, so the children’s opinions are welcome, but I am the ultimate arbiter. Sarah and Stephanie voted for the convertible, the 500c, but cost and the complete loss of trunk space ruled it out. Nico advocated strongly for the Abarth—such a dude car. The cost, however, was prohibitive, and vroom, vroom, vrooming all over town held little appeal for me. They all wanted Beats Audio. I did, too, but Corky gently pointed out that one does lose cargo space with the woofer.

It's a simulation of a head-on crash in which both vehicles are traveling at the same rate of speed, 35 mph. Driver and front passenger dummies help measure the forces that create chest deflection, neck extension, and femur and foot injuries. A recent tweak to the test replaced a male passenger dummy with a smaller, female dummy.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<strong>Side Crash:</strong> The side crash test simulates being hit from the side by a 3,015-pound car traveling at 38.5 mph. As the agency says, it's a simulation of an intersection-type crash.

The driver dummy represents an average-size male, while the rear passenger dummy represents a female.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"The side crash test also includes a sideways-into-pole test, which slams the vehicle into a pole 25 centimeters (about ten inches) in diameter at 20 mph at a 75-degree angle. This is a simulation of a crash into a fixed object, such as a utility pole or a tree. The pole hits at the driver’s seating location, and the test measures the head and pelvis injuries to the driver and the front passenger. NHTSA combines the ratings of the two side crash tests for its overall side crash score.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<strong>Rollover:</strong>  NHTSA also performs rollover testing on most SUVs, pickups, and minivans.

While NHTSA’s tests crash a car’s entire front end into an immobile barrier, IIHS simulates crashing just part of a vehicle’s front end into a car of a similar weight. In moderate overlap tests, 40 percent of a car’s front end hits a deformable barrier at 40 mph.  The small overlap test engages just 25 percent of a car’s crumple zone, with test cars hitting a rigid barrier with the front left corner of the car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"Both front crash tests record forces to test the dummy’s head, neck, chest, legs, and feet. These tests sometimes cause cars to spin, which might engage side curtain airbags as well as front airbags.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"<strong>Side Crash:</strong> The IIHS side crash test is similar to NHTSA’s, but it uses a heavier barrier (3,300 pounds instead of 3,015 pounds) and a higher point of impact, which aims to simulate being hit by a truck or an SUV. The test uses a female dummy in the driver’s seat and a twelve-year-old child dummy in the rear passenger seat. The rest of the IIHS tests use adult male dummies.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":17,"text":"<strong>Rear Crash:</strong> For rear crash tests, the IIHS first evaluates a car’s head restraints. If they are improperly designed or positioned, the car automatically fails the test. Cars with head restraints that could effectively protect a driver’s head and neck in the event of a collision are hit from the rear by a similarly sized car traveling at 20 mph.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":18,"text":"<strong>Rollover:</strong> IIHS uses roof strength as a measure of rollover safety in cars. The test involves pressing a metal plate against one side of a car’s roof until the roof gives way. Cars that earn a Good rating must withstand four times their own weight before the roof reaches five inches of crush.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":19,"text":"In addition to ratings for individual tests, IIHS awards the best performers with a Top Safety Pick or Top Safety Pick Plus designation. Top Safety Picks must earn a Good rating in the moderate overlap front, side, rollover, and rear crash tests. Small overlap results are not taken into account for the Top Safety Pick award. To earn Top Safety Pick Plus, cars must earn a Good rating in four of the IIHS’s five tests and at least an Acceptable rating in the fifth. Small overlap results are considered for the Top Safety Pick Plus designation.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":20,"text":"<h3>The Fine Print</h3>\nNHTSA and IIHS are both careful to specify that shoppers shouldn’t compare crash ratings across vehicle types (don’t compare a Honda Fit to a Chevrolet Tahoe, for instance) or compare vehicles subjected to different crash tests.

The wrong numbers were blamed on faulty calibration of ratings back home in South Korea, and the adjustment reduced the whole lineup’s average fuel economy by three percent, from 27 mpg to 26 mpg.

The way it stands now, the automakers themselves test for fuel economy, and the EPA confirms that by actually testing about fifteen percent of the cars on the market itself, under lab conditions, but also reviews test data from the automakers to spot potential problems. The EPA said Ford followed the rules and is not at fault for this  C-Max issue.\n<br>\n<br>\nA check of the <a href= http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/fe_test_schedules.shtml rel=”nofollow” target=”_blank”>EPA testing</a> parameters shows that “city driving” is tested at an average 21.2 mph, while “highway driving” is tested at an average of 48.3 mph.  The EPA also states that “your mileage may vary” is not just a saying. What kinds of roads you drive on, how you accelerate and brake, how fast you go, what the weather and terrain are like, and what you might be carrying or towing can all have a big effect on your fuel economy.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<h3>Should You Care?</h3>\nWell, or how much should you care? Yes, you might buy the C-Max Hybrid because of the great fuel economy, and be disappointed that it hasn't quite gotten where the claims led you to believe, but it’s still probably so much better than whatever you probably drove before. The bottom line may be that you should choose your next car based on a whole lot of factors, not just on one selling point, no matter how compelling it looks at the time.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20154,"make":"Ford","model":"C-Max","year":2013},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:09:14.986-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865754987 }} },{ "_id":397161,"title":"Smart Electric City Tour","subTitle":"","slug":"smart-electric-city-tour","promoTitle":"Smart Electric City Tour","promoTeaserSmall":"I spent an afternoon piloting one of those tiny little La-Z-Boys on wheels!

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-14T12:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"smart electric city tour","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56408098/smart-citydrive-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":56408098,"fileName":"smart-citydrive-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-14T12:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"smart electric city tour","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58030155/smart-city-header.jpg","fileMasterId":58030155,"fileName":"smart-city-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-14T12:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"smart electric city tour","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56408107/smart-citydrive-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":56408107,"fileName":"smart-citydrive-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":535085,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Smart invited a bevy of local journalists to spend time in the brand-new 2013 Electric Drive, the EV version of the Smart ForTwo.

The other is that Mercedes has a killer navigation system that it wants you to use.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding.

We were surrounded by experts: our neighbors pulled out their van’s third-row seat, plopped it on the ground, strapped their babies into car seats, and sat nearby in soccer chairs. The drive-in seat in our Town & Country needed some padding to make it bearable, because the headrests create a less-than-comfortable sitting area.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

They were revolutionary in proportion, in performance, and in the beauty of their manufacturing, as well as their engineering, and the metals they were made of.

Even the filler cap on the gas tank is something you would want on your desk as a paperweight.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Millers were beautiful, they were futuristic-looking, they were mechanically advanced, and they were unbelievably narrow—like a cigar tube with four wheels stuck out at the corners.

But it should be on anyone’s life list to have the opportunity to sit in one and drive it. And that’s what I got to do. I had it on my schedule for two years and kept that date. I showed up with my helmet and was relieved to see it was eighty degrees and not 100 degrees, as it was the year before. I saw a line of Millers, the largest gathering they’d ever seen at this event. As soon as I walked up, my friend Dan Davis said, “Oh, I think you should drive this car first.” I wasn’t there five minutes before I was sitting in the 1920 Miller TNT, and out I went on the track.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"It’s amazing. You’re sitting in this cigar tube, and everything is rudimentary. There’s an accelerator, a brake, and a clutch, from right to left. I barely fit into it with my big feet. The body is cast aluminum, which was absolutely revolutionary for the day. There was nothing like it. There are only three pressure gauges on the dash and a big giant wooden steering wheel and a nice, wide leather seat. (It’s only wide because it’s also supposed to accommodate a riding mechanic.)","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"The sides are exposed below your waist, and there’s no windshield to protect you from the air blowing right in your face. Luckily these aren’t 100-mph cars, or they’d wipe the eyelashes right off your eyes. There’s a reason why those guys wore goggles. I was probably going 50 mph—there’s no speedometer—and it felt like 100 mph. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<strong>The experience is so thrilling. You’re out in the wind driving this big old cart.</strong> The operation of the controls is beautiful. You have a giant worn wooden wheel in your hands that feels so good and is almost 100 years old. The shift lever is a beautiful large ball that fits in your hand. You think to yourself, I’m driving around the track that the car actually raced on in the Twenties.  It’s the same pleasure in machinery you feel if you type a letter on a 1920 Underwood typewriter. The noise, the smell, everything gets me all choked up.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"It’s very hard to get one of these cars to start and go. There’s no synchro between the gears, so when you change gears you can’t just go from one to the next. You have to depress the clutch, pull the big lever down out of gear into neutral, gun the engine a little, put the clutch back in, and move into the next gear. If you don't time it right,  you get this big graunching noise that is incredibly embarrassing. I’ve had a lot of experience with this kind of gearbox from driving old cars, so I was pretty good, but I'm embarrassed to admit I was not 100 percent.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"It’s very simple, but you have to pay attention, because the last thing you want to do is damage this car.

","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"Now I was really feeling great, and in that car I was going even faster. Hurley Haywood came out in the TNT car, and we were running tandem around the track, and that was as fun as it could be—until I waved him by and let my hand sort of drop to my side, where it came into contact with the giant spinning right rear tire. My hand flew up in the air, and I quickly jerked it to my side without looking at it. Do you know how, when you’ve had a very bad injury, it doesn’t hurt at first? Well, I didn’t want to look at my hand because I was afraid I had just wiped three fingers off. Then I carefully looked at it, and it was just filthy dirty from grabbing the moving tire. I kept both hands on the steering wheel for the rest of the time. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"<strong>After that I decided I’d better come in, and I discovered the brakes were not working.</strong> It was too late for me to grab the outside brake lever, which controls the rear brakes. So I aborted coming in to the pits and went out for one more really slow lap and this time, when I came into the pits, I had my foot on the brake and my right hand on the outside brake lever. That slowed it enough to stall me again.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":17,"text":"That didn't deter me from eyeing the very lovely and very petite old Indy car, the 1923 Miller 122. That one was an especially tiny one: a single-seater, with a body eighteen inches wide at its widest. It  trapped Dan Davis for forty-five minutes last summer in the broiling sun. His leather shoes couldn't get purchase on the oily floor, and his crew had to remove the steering wheel to rescue him.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":18,"text":"I crawled up on the 122 and perched above the seat. What I saw below was not encouraging. On the right of the center tunnel were accelerator and brake together, taking up what looked like the total width of my stockinged right foot. The clutch was all alone on the left. I just had to figure out how to slide in under the big wooden steering wheel. Then I’d decide if I could keep the gas and brake separate. My plan was to jump from my perch down into the seat with my legs locked at the knees. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":19,"text":"I took the leap. My left leg slid right into place. My right knee shot up as far as it would go, trapped solidly between the steering wheel and the body side. Wouldn’t go up, wouldn’t go down. I wasn’t panicky, but I was, uh, concerned. I was stuck fast with only my horrified cameraman as witness.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":20,"text":"Not quite. Two older guys were watching everything. After fifteen minutes, they ambled over. “We don’t mean to be impertinent, but we can get you out of there.” Without a chainfall?\r\n“I’ll slide my hands under your bottom.” Whoa. You’re each going to grab my ass? “Well . . . yes.” Okay, then, have at it. So they each slid their hands under one butt cheek, then levitated me straight up and onto the body behind the seat.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-23T09:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"great lakes swimapalooza preview","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56844871/swim-homepage.png","fileMasterId":56844871,"fileName":"swim-homepage.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoWide":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-23T09:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"great lakes swimapalooza preview","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56844871/swim-homepage.png","fileMasterId":56844871,"fileName":"swim-homepage.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_wide","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-23T09:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"great lakes swimapalooza preview","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58272144/swim-header.png","fileMasterId":58272144,"fileName":"swim-header.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-08-23T09:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"great lakes swimapalooza preview","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56844871/swim-homepage.png","fileMasterId":56844871,"fileName":"swim-homepage.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":541160,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"great lakes swimapalooza preview","caption":"","fileMasterId":58272141,"fileName":"swim_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58272141/swim_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"<h3>Five Great Lakes in One Day</h3>\nMy family is about to get into a 2013 Chevrolet Suburban, and we're going to drive to and swim in all of the Great Lakes in one day.

It has most of the things I want in a car: interesting looks, a hatchback body style, good gas mileage, a reasonable price, and a silly name. But the sub-$20,000 base model is also sub-140 horsepower, and I’d heard it wasn’t particularly fun to drive. But wait! The advent of the 2013 model year brought with it a turbocharged version, which kicks the base Veloster’s 138 horsepower and 132 pound-feet of torque up to 201 hp and 195 pound-feet of torque.

But by the end of my weekend, I found myself wishing I had more time in it—always a good sign.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Just by looking at it, you can tell that the Veloster is a little odd. It has an asymmetrical design, with two doors on the passenger's side and one on the driver’s side. The third door is unusual, but it’s undoubtedly helpful for passengers trying to climb in the back. The back seat is fairly roomy for a car this size, with enough head and leg room for my adult passengers.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show.

In our test car, the engine makes 200 horsepower, but a recent engine update bumped Beetle Turbo models up to 210 horsepower. Volkswagen says the update shaves 0.2 second off the Beetle Turbo’s 0-to-60-mph time and translates to a four to eight percent fuel economy savings.<br>\n<br>\n• Volkswagen is tweaking the Beetle convertible lineup for 2014. The Beetle Turbo convertible will be rebadged as the Beetle R-Line Convertible. Volkswagen’s R-Line offerings are performance inspired, but this new designation doesn’t come with any powertrain changes. It's the same old Turbo with a brand-new name.<br>\n<br>\n• The Beetle convertible lineup features three engine choices. In addition to this car’s turbocharged four-cylinder powerplant, there’s a 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine that makes 170 horsepower and starts at $25,790, including destination, and a TDI model with a 2.0-liter 140-horsepower diesel-burning engine. The diesel Beetle costs a little more (starting at $28,690), but it’s rated at 28 mpg in the city and 41 mpg on the highway.<br>\n<br>\n• This Beetle is one of the few convertibles on the market to offer a rear seat, and it’s surprisingly roomy. An adult might feel cramped, but most kids will fit just fine.<br>\n<br>\n• It’s hard to name many direct competitors to the Beetle convertible, since so much of its appeal comes from its unique history and design, but check out other small, quirky convertibles like the Fiat 500c or the Mini Cooper convertible.<br>\n<br>\n• For $30,665, you might expect a nicer interior (this Beetle is awash in plastic and leatherette), but if you ever feel ripped off, just remember: you’re driving a convertible. The power folding top is fully automatic and can operate while the vehicle is moving at speeds of up to 31 mph.<br>\n<br>\n• Style features: Three-color adjustable ambient lighting, leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel and leather-wrapped shift knob, eighteen-inch aluminum alloy wheels, leather seating surfaces (standard in Turbo with Sound and Navigation), and gloss black exterior mirror housings, available in special 50s, 60s, and 70s edition decade-themed models.<br>","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":9},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:09:20.535-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865760535 }} },{ "_id":403184,"title":"Is My 17-Year-Old Ready for a Car?","subTitle":"","slug":"is-my-17-year-old-ready","promoTitle":"Is My 17-Year-Old Ready for a Car?","promoTeaserSmall":"Time to have The Talk...about money and responsibility.

","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>Lesson One: Sticker Shock</h3>\r\nSince Cole didn’t know how much the Mustang he coveted cost, we looked it up online. So his first lesson was sticker shock. Its starting price of $22,995 (including destination charge) was more than twice his highest guess. That reality check brought him right down to earth. In fact, it made him give up. So, at Baldwin’s suggestion, I offered to match dollar for dollar everything he could save, which would put a car—if not necessarily that car—within reach. “This makes it possible for him to buy a car without financing,” he explained. “But he will still have some skin in the game. And if he can’t afford much car, that’s his fault. But if he pulls together $10,000, you will have to have to match it. So be prepared.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Duly warned, I moved on to the next lesson.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>Teaching a Teen to Budget</h3>\r\n“Create a simple budget,” said Wahl. “Include up-front costs and costs that occur over time, such as gas, maintenance, and insurance. Be sure he shows his income and expenses.” Cole liked being treated like someone mature enough to have income and expenses—and the intelligence to manage them. And budgeting was well within his math skills. But he didn’t have a job. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"“Well, you need one to own a car.” I told him.

Much better, he said, that I teach him to buy what he can afford and avoid debt, which raises the long-term cost of the car and limits his future financial choices. “Financing teaches him that he can buy a car he can’t afford to impress people he doesn’t know,” he said. I agree—at least when it comes to financial planning. But I know my son. He will like the possibility of a fast solution. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"Wahl said:  “It’s important for him to understand that a loan helps you get what you want more quickly. But it comes at a cost.

In fact, his car of choice right now is “something I can afford.” But choosing a car is big part of the process. So we are having an ongoing conversation about how to do that well.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"“This is a great time to talk about needs and wants,” says Baldwin. “You may want a great car. But you probably don’t need it.” My fear is that Cole’s needs and wants might not be very mature.

","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"In addition to safety, we are exploring the long-term expenses. “Is there a difference in fuel economy and the total gas costs?” asked Wahl. “Is one model less expensive to maintain?” All important things to consider.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"<h3>Negotiating</h3>\r\nFor now, Cole is driving our old minivan and saving his money. But these car-fueled financial lessons are working. He has already gotten a job. And he has pushed off the financing decision until he has enough money for at least a sizable down payment. Meanwhile, he is hyper aware that every fast food meal and video game he buys is pushing his new car further into the future. When he is ready to buy, I will explain how to evaluate a used car and the art of negotiation. In fact, we might try negotiating on some smaller purchases in the interim.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"I suppose it would be fun to have a big child (and budget) so I could wrap a car up and hand my baby the keys.

The cars may not be crashing much in that town, but nosy people can find out where they’ve been parked, making Fort Collins a contender for “America’s Safest and Most Spied-Upon Driving City,” perhaps.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h3>Related Stories on Jean Knows Cars</h3>\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-maintenance/car-insurance-fail/\" target=\"_blank\">Car Insurance Fail!</a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/cool-tech/car-tech-news/accident-avoidance-mode/\" target=\"_blank\">Accident Avoidance Mode!</a><br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/cool-tech/car-tech-news/do-you-want-a-black-box/\" target=\"_blank\">Do You Want a Black Box in Your Car?</a><br></h3>","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":6},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:09:21.442-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865761443 }} },{ "_id":402642,"title":"Harvest Tour: Taste the U.S.A.","subTitle":"","slug":"harvest-tour-taste","promoTitle":"Harvest Tour: Taste the U.S.A.","promoTeaserSmall":"Visit a few fruit and vegetable capitals!

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

There's a center \"safety barrier\" that is supposed to keep your dog from getting into the front seat, but that's a laugh; it wouldn't stop your average dog from simply pushing its way through to the front (or climbing right over the top). It does make the back seat into a single-level seating area, which is good, but if your dog is restrained with a harness, that will not be an issue anyway.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-08T14:22:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"great lakes swimapalooza","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58700028/swimapalooza-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":58700028,"fileName":"swimapalooza-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-09T10:51:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Swimapalooza","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58722819/swim-header.png","fileMasterId":58722819,"fileName":"swim-header.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-08T14:22:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"great lakes swimapalooza","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58700028/swimapalooza-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":58700028,"fileName":"swimapalooza-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":541946,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"great lakes swimapalooza","caption":"","fileMasterId":57232618,"fileName":"swimapalooza_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57232618/swimapalooza_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":393},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"My family and I went on an unusual journey at the end of the summer: we successfully swam in all five of the Great Lakes in just one day.

With babies and toddlers in car seats, I'm betting you mostly play what <em>you</em> like to hear, and they're along for the ride.

Know what you want your kids to hear.</h3> Don't be mindless about what you play. In my case, I wanted my kids to hear complex, gorgeous classical music. So I used to go to the library and check out cassettes, and later CDs. One memorable day, I maneuvered to have the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto in one hand and my three-year-old in the other. I waited for my moment: we had a twenty-five-mile drive to take, just the two of us. I put it on, and he ignored it and wriggled around in his seat...until it got to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKfdMR1WfNY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> part where the orchestra explodes. His eyes as big as saucers, he didn't move a muscle for the rest of the drive. I could see his brain cells expand at that very moment. These days, you have the whole YouTube/iTunes world of music at your disposal. Think it over, and choose wisely.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>2. Start low and gradually get louder.</h3> By this I mean, you can play almost anything if it's almost unnoticeable at first. I can't even overstress what a huge discovery that was for me, and it still works no matter how old my kids get. I used to be a Suzuki violin mom, meaning I had discs of violin music that my two violin student children were supposed to listen to a lot every day. If I put on the CD at normal volume, they might protest (the other two who were not studying violin protested loudest of all). But, I learned, if I put it on almost vanishingly softly, they wouldn't care, and I could slowly increase the volume until it reached loud. By that point, they were listening and usually liking it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>3. Make it into a treat, not a lecture.</h3> For instance, I waited till my three older children, then all between eight and ten, were in the car together. I announced, \"I'm going to play you one of my favorite songs. It has a murder in it. I think you're all big enough to handle it. Okay?\" Had their attention then! Guess what the song was? <a href=http://youtu.be/3p4MZJsexEs rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Bohemian Rhapsody,</a> by Queen. I will never forget the looks on their faces as they took it in. They all still listen to Queen, years later. I also tried to get under-twelves interested in Bob Dylan. That one didn't take at first; I mainly remember their derisive laughter at his \"bad voice.\" I accepted that and didn't force the issue or lecture, and now my eighteen-year-old has virtually the whole Dylan catalog on his iPod. I have to think that presenting the music to him at a young age was a start, even if I didn't get instant gratification for it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>4. Tie in the music with other things you can do together.</h3> You could plan to take a child to a concert of someone you love to hear, or someone you want your kids to appreciate. I got Paul McCartney tickets for my eight-year-old, who had just started guitar lessons at the time. It was a surprise, but in the weeks before we went, I played a ton of vintage Beatles and McCartney music in the car. I didn't say anything about why. When we arrived at the Palace of Auburn Hills to hear Sir Paul, my boy already knew all the songs without being told he had to. You could also choose a theme, such as New Orleans jazz when you're going there on a family vacation, or songs in a language your kids are learning, or movie music in the week before the Oscars are on. The car is the place where you have the block of uninterrupted time with kids to build a theme like that.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>5. Have a sense of occasion.</h3> If you're going on a trip, why not make a road trip playlist? (Here are some of the <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/the-mix/labor-day-playlists/\" target=\"_blank\">Jean Knows Cars playlists</a> we just made, for inspiration.) I associate <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3plBzBB8LE8\" rel=\"nofollow\"\" target=\"_blank\">M.I.A.'s All I Wanna Do</a> with a drive to Vermont with my fourteen- and sixteen-year-old sons, because we had it on our playlist. Not like I am recommending that music, but it helped us bond, and when I appreciated that, they appreciated what I wanted to play, in that case <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvliMzAFWHM&feature=share&list=PL35720F32C815AFE1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Graceland,</a> by Paul Simon.

Come on, you can think of some great songs your little kids need to hear that won't be on the radio or their iPods.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"You may not care if your children absorb Tchaikovsky (shame on you, though). But if you want your kids to grow up knowing and appreciating jazz, or Prince, or Leo Kottke, or Pink Floyd, they're not going to pick it up at elementary school. It's absolutely your job to insert it into their heads. In the car is the best place to do that. Bonus: The more you set the expectation that you will give your kids a great listening experience in the car, the fewer times you'll have to twist the dial to get away from \"Blurred Lines\" and One Direction.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-13T04:09:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 smart electric drive","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58912938/smart-fitness-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":58912938,"fileName":"smart-fitness-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-13T04:09:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 smart electric drive","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58913004/smart-fitness-header.jpg","fileMasterId":58913004,"fileName":"smart-fitness-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-13T04:09:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 smart electric drive","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58912938/smart-fitness-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":58912938,"fileName":"smart-fitness-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":542769,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Price:</strong> $30,290 as tested (includes destination charge) <br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Permanent-magnet AC electric motor, 74 horsepower, plus 17.6-kWh lithium-ion battery pack<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> One-speed direct drive automatic <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 122 MPGe city/93 MPGe highway<br>\n<strong>Driving range:</strong> 76 miles city/59 miles highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Interior styling, especially in Design Red<br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Technology package, includes Navigation and Surround Sound ($1,600)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Walking, taking the bus, biking, Chevrolet Volt, Ford Focus Electric, Nissan Leaf<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/6x7ABLc9CtI?list=UUKWoLlV8-sE8zQnoWHI9qoA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<em>Diminutive electric vehicle with two seats and a roomy trunk seeks companion.

The cornering is tight, and seriously you can’t beat the turning radius. The acceleration is peppy, the top speed is 78 mph, and the 11.5-second 0-to-60-mph time would make the Lollipop Guild drop their lollipops. The handling is nimble, but because of the short wheelbase the ride can be a bit jarring. I was also concerned that it could really be dangerous to hit a large pothole.

It's the range anxiety that would be the deal breaker for me.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"The guys at Applied Fitness Solutions with the Smart Electric Drive","fileMasterId":53277800,"fileName":"smart_fitness_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/53277800/smart_fitness_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Smart Electric Drive cabriolet","fileMasterId":53298293,"fileName":"smart_syb_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/53298293/smart_syb_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Smart Electric Drive cabriolet","fileMasterId":53298422,"fileName":"smart_syb_06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/53298422/smart_syb_06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Smart Electric Drive cabriolet","fileMasterId":58807326,"fileName":"smart_syb_04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58807326/smart_syb_04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Smart Electric Drive cabriolet","fileMasterId":53298350,"fileName":"smart_syb_05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/53298350/smart_syb_05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"The guys at Applied Fitness Solutions with the Smart Electric Drive","fileMasterId":58807650,"fileName":"smart_fitness_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58807650/smart_fitness_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"The guys at Applied Fitness Solutions with the Smart Electric Drive","fileMasterId":53277803,"fileName":"smart_fitness_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/53277803/smart_fitness_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":14,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":8},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:09:31.655-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865771656 }} },{ "_id":404242,"title":"Nissan Leaf EV, Now Available Used","subTitle":"","slug":"nissan-leaf-ev-now-available-used","promoTitle":"Nissan Leaf EV, Now Available Used","promoTeaserSmall":"You can get the plug-in through the Nissan Certified Pre-Owned program.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-19T08:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"fiat lust epilogue","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57768544/fiatlust-epilogue-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":57768544,"fileName":"fiatlust-epilogue-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-19T08:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"fiat lust epilogue","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57768535/fiatlust-06.jpg","fileMasterId":57768535,"fileName":"fiatlust-06.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-19T08:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"fiat lust epilogue","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57768544/fiatlust-epilogue-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":57768544,"fileName":"fiatlust-epilogue-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":543486,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<em>My story began in the winter with <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/fiat-lust/\" target=\"_blank\">Part One,</a> when I first started considering whether I could justify replacing my Honda Odyssey with a Fiat 500.

Not only can you track the progress of the whole trip using Trip A and of each leg with Trip B, but if you’re feeling international as well, you can set the language in French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, or Italian.  Within Trip A and Trip B, you can see your range: how many miles left on the tank of gas. A useful tool, for I have been known in my driving to try to be über-efficient—I won’t detour now, my next errand will take me by the station—only to end up stranded in the neighborhood, or worse, on the highway. Oops. So much for efficiency. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":19,"text":"You can also follow your gas mileage, which has become my new delightful obsession. The display provides instant gas mileage or average mpg.  If I’m having a bad day, nothing cheers me up more than to see my average gas mileage around 35 mpg and think of the money I’m saving.  That savings went into consideration when I agreed to this <em>giro,</em> as the Italians call it.  Had I been in the Honda Odyssey, the gas cost alone would have made it prohibitive. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":20,"text":"Getting gas into the car, however, proved to be a bit of a trick. As I pulled in to the gas station off M-10, onto the two-lane road that leads from Clare to Cadillac, I realized that I didn’t know where the button was to pop open the gas tank. I searched high and low. No luck. I pulled out the abbreviated owner’s manual (the longer version now comes on CD). Apparently, most people must intuitively know how to open their gas tanks, because neither “gas” “gas tank,” nor “fuel” merit entry in the index. It was fifteen minutes of befuddlement, with a running monologue to myself: You have a Ph.D., and you can’t figure out how to open the f-ing gas tank to put fuel in your new Fiat?!?! I should have gone to law school. As if law school would have had a special class on gas-tank-opening litigation.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":21,"text":"I must have skimmed most of the owner’s manual before I found the secret page, only to discover that there is no button.

Fair to say that Sophia and I do not always understand each other.  I suppose if I consulted the owner’s manual about more than the location of the fuel tank button, Sophia and I could avoid having to go to counseling to reconcile our differences.  Like all good friendships, we’re going to need a little time to learn each other’s quirks.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":23,"text":"As one of the main arteries to the towns and lakes \"up north,\" M-115 gets its fair share of holiday and recreational travelers in the summer: SUVs with Yamaha boxes on top and laden with bikes on the back, pickup trucks with Jet Skis, and plenty of RV and truck traffic. The road is one of significant hills and dales, which makes for interesting traffic, as the more laden vehicles struggle to make it up the steep inclines. It is well designed, however, with lots of passing opportunities.

Each summer, the Interlochen Center for the Arts, one of America’s cultural gems, hosts a Summer Arts Program in which teenagers from all over the globe give up typical summer activities and come together to dedicate themselves to six intense weeks of music school, complete with history and theory classes, hours of lessons and practice, master classes, and high expectations of performance. The daily schedule is rigorous, beginning at 6:45 a.m. reveille and calisthenics outside the rustic cabins next to Green Lake, and it goes straight through until cabin call at 9:00 p.m. To wander the campus is to hear a cacophonous blend of flute sonatas, piano concertos, vocal arias, and string quartets emanating from the practice studios, which really are huts set in the Michigan woods.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":26,"text":"Interlochen alumni speak of their experiences as transcendent and life changing. Attend a performance, and one can see why. My Sarah, a soprano, had been awarded the role of the Countess in <em>Marriage of Figaro,</em> for the high-school Opera Scenes performance.

Sarah’s first instinct was to plug my iPod into the sound system and play comfort music: the Italian soundtrack from <em>Anastasia,</em> a movie we must have watched 1,000 times when we lived in Italy.

The name harks back to the day all campers came and went by train; Interlochen traditions are nothing if not enduring. Bursts of laughter were followed by a quivering lower lip and a small stream of tears, and a snippet of a tale would be shared. This lasted an hour or so, and then we were well north of Traverse City. <em>Anastasia</em> finished, and in the quiet, she explained that her time at Interlochen had made her realize that vocal performance was what she wanted to do with her life, that her path was not going to be like that of her friends. It was a realization that needed processing, and I now understood the request to go home via Al-Gon-Quian. She needed closure, to say goodbye to one way of life as she fully embraced another. We needed more music.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":32,"text":"On the second day of having my Fiat, my dearest friend, who is a treasure trove of musical knowledge, came by to program my radio. She knows me well enough to know that I might never find the time to play with SiriusXM, so she decided to take matters into her own hands.

Broadway went on Station 2, Frank Sinatra on 3, and Sirius U on 4.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":33,"text":"I broke the silence. “Hey Sarah, let me show you SiriusXM. It’s pretty cool.

She knew every note. Transported by the Italian and the moment, I began reminiscing about another memorable summer drive, following SS2 through the countryside of southern Tuscany, where olive groves give way to fields of sunflowers—<em>girasole</em> in Italian, which literally means “turn toward the sun.”  They are my favorite flower, perhaps because of the vivid association with the Italian landscape. As if on cue, over the next crest, we were met by an expansive field of sunflowers on the right, glimpses of Grand Traverse Bay on the left, and blue sky and long, white puffy clouds above.

Sarah was asleep next to me as I drove down I-75 to Ann Arbor. I thought back to Corky’s parting comment, “I hope you love it!”  I did, but I wondered if the magic would endure, if my Fiat Moment would be a blip in time, if I would still feel this way going about the normal, prosaic tasks of daily life, a far cry from such a moving journey with my sixteen-year-old.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":38,"text":"It is fair to say that, yes, the magic has endured. Perhaps it is in part due to the fact that the Fiat 500 is a less common, less well-known model.

It is a tacit acknowledgment of camaraderie among Fiat 500 owners when passing each other on the road.

Directions for this element of Fiat ownership are not found in the owner’s manual.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":40,"text":"Then there is the routine questioning. It takes a little longer now to move about town. Not only do heads turn as I am driving down the streets of Ann Arbor, but strangers will stop me and ask, “What type of car is that?” The question is usually followed by interest in the gas mileage.   Acquaintances, on the other hand, if they have not seen me in a while, exclaim in delight, “Is that your car?!?!”  “It’s so…..” Fill in the blank: “Cool!” “Cute!” “Totally you!” “Gorgeous!” And then, always: “Do you love it?”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":41,"text":"These are not, I note, reactions one ever receives driving a Honda Odyssey. Others who know about my 500 have remarked my movements about town, which might be due to the fact that I seem to have the only Luce Blu Lounge in Ann Arbor: “Hey, I saw you on West Liberty the other day around noon.” That element has become a little disconcerting, and I have surmised that were I to need to move about incognito, I’d have to take the minivan.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":42,"text":"And then there are those with Fiat Lust. Fiat Lust, it turns out, afflicts more people than one would think. I parked my 500 at the pool one day to pop in quickly and grab a forgotten suit.

I’ve driven around the state; taken a trip to Point Pelee in Canada, where the odometer crossed 1,000 miles; and recommenced my commute to Detroit. All told, I've gone 1,445 miles, and I’ve only spent roughly $160 in gas, so, in terms of gas savings, the car is extremely practical.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":44,"text":"In terms of mental health, too, the Fiat's practicality cannot be underestimated. Nothing soothes me more than to hop in my Cinquecento, feel the leather of the steering wheel, and experience the calm contrast of the creamy white and pale blue dash. It even worked on the day my ex-husband returned my two younger children to me after their ten-day holiday in Maine, and I immediately discovered they were infested with lice. By the time I had returned from the drugstore with treatment items, I was calm and no longer thinking murderous thoughts. If the Fiat 500 keeps me out of jail, it’s definitely practical.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":45,"text":"Some Fiat Lust has an immediate solution: one “simply” has to be in a life position that makes it work.

She stared at my Fiat longingly, with that look in her eye, and said, with that tone in her voice: “I told my children the other day that if I did not have to drive this minivan, <em>that</em> is the car I would be driving….right now, it’s just not practical.”  I smiled.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-20T11:48:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"weekly windup 9 20 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59295729/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59295729,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-20T11:48:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"weekly windup 9 20 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59295666/weekly-header.jpg","fileMasterId":59295666,"fileName":"weekly-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-20T11:48:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"weekly windup 9 20 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59295729/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59295729,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":543491,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Some things we ran across on the way to finding what we were looking for.

What you see in the film is very close to what you get on a track. The film's R rating will probably keep you from taking your car-crazy ten-year-old to the theater, but that's okay. I'm happy to report that, unlike so many movies these days, <em>Rush</em> is a very grown-up story about human striving and achievement.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"Director Ron Howard takes a turn on track.","fileMasterId":59421837,"fileName":"rush_movie_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59421837/rush_movie_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Behind the scenes during the making of Rush.","fileMasterId":59421834,"fileName":"rush_movie_04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59421834/rush_movie_04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Rush focuses in very closely on the rivalry between Hunt and Lauda.","fileMasterId":59421846,"fileName":"rush_movie_homepage.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59421846/rush_movie_homepage.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"The real Niki Lauda (left) and James Hunt.","fileMasterId":59421843,"fileName":"rush_movie_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59421843/rush_movie_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Ferrari racing star Niki Lauda, as played by Daniel Bruhl in the movie Rush.","fileMasterId":53953613,"fileName":"rush_movie_07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/53953613/rush_movie_07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"McLaren racing star James Hunt, as played in Rush by  Chris Hemsworth.","fileMasterId":53950691,"fileName":"Hunt_photo.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/53950691/Hunt_photo.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":398},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":624}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"Niki Lauda, as played in Rush by Daniel Bruhl, with members of his Ferrari team.","fileMasterId":53951690,"fileName":"rush_movie_06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/53951690/rush_movie_06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":5,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:09:38.269-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865778270 }} },{ "_id":404607,"title":"Teen's First Car?

It has Intelligent Brake Assist with Forward Collision Warning, so it will warn him if it senses danger ahead and, if he fails to respond to the warning, apply the brakes to reduce the severity of the crash.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

This isn’t the everyday variety of worry, even though it happens every day. I know driving is dangerous for teens because I’ve seen the numbers: Thirty-five percent of all teenage deaths happen behind the wheel. I also know my son: He is a very distracted teen. Even without a smartphone, earbuds, friends texting him, hilarious YouTube videos, and mobile games in the palm of his hand, he’s always been a bit of a “lost in thought” space case. And eleven percent of all drivers under the age of twenty involved in fatal crashes were distracted at the time.

Safekids.org recently published a study detailing how dangerous this common behavior is. According to this report, one in five high school students and one in eight middle school students were observed crossing the street while distracted by technology. I guess it’s not that surprising that pedestrian injuries are the fifth leading cause of injury-related death in the United States for children ages five to nineteen. And given how many teenagers have a smartphone, they are at greatest risk. According to SafeKids.org, “Teens have a death rate twice that of younger children and account for half of all child pedestrian deaths.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>1. Talk to Your Daughters and Sons</h3>\nAs a parent, I obviously need to talk to my son (and my not-yet-driving daughter) about this very dangerous habit right along with all the other risky teen behaviors, like alcohol, sex, drugs, guns, and driving, because statistically this is more dangerous than teen pregnancy or gun violence.

Realize That Anyone Could Be Walking while Distracted</h3> \nThis study focused on teens. But, according to John Ulczycki, vice-president of strategic initiatives at the National Safety Council: “This could just as easily apply to adults because they are just as distracted. Teens tend to text and play games while walking, but adults are talking on the phone. And the difference in how distracted people are by those activities is negligible.” Ulczycki explains that you can do some things (chew gum, for example) while walking and still focus on walking. But anything that presents a “cognitive distraction\"—and all these activities do—means you will not see what is right in front of you. So I guess I have to start driving as if I’m living in a zombie apocalypse--one, that is, where I desperately don’t want to hurt any of the zombies?","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>3.

There may have been a time when I could assume that if someone looked right at my car, they saw it and were likely to do their best to avoid being hit by it. But—in the zombie apocalypse—you can’t make that assumption. A person who is “cognitively distracted,” as Ulczycki describes it, might look right at you and not see you at all. “Their mind is occupied by something else,” he explains. “They are looking but not seeing. Psychologists call this ‘inattention blindness.’ ”","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"driving in a zombie apocalypse","caption":"","fileMasterId":58176610,"fileName":"distracted_pedestrian_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58176610/distracted_pedestrian_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":6,"text":"<h3>4. And Know That They Might Be Jaywalking</h3>\nAccording to the Highway Safety Research Center, jaywalking is also a huge problem. So I can’t assume that distracted pedestrians are planning to stay safely on the sidewalk. If I’m in a school zone or a residential area, I have to assume that pedestrians can’t hear my vehicle because they might be wearing earbuds, and they can’t see me because they are cognitively distracted. It's also important to assume they have no intention of obeying the rules. Better to be pleasantly surprised.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>5. As for You: Don’t<em> Drive</em> Distracted</h3>\nAll this is challenging enough for a driver. But if that driver is also distracted by a phone call, a text, or the phone’s navigation software, it’s a perfect storm in which someone is very likely to get hurt. I may not be able to stop those teenagers from walking distracted, but I can put my own phone down when I’m behind the wheel and pay careful attention to the zombie apocalypse that’s happening outside my vehicle.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"New Car Features","id":1034782,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech/new-car-features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-27T11:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"wood that looks like wood","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58242532/wood-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":58242532,"fileName":"wood-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-27T11:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"wood that looks like wood","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58242526/volvo-XC60-04.jpg","fileMasterId":58242526,"fileName":"volvo-XC60-04.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-09-27T11:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"wood that looks like wood","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58242532/wood-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":58242532,"fileName":"wood-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":544370,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"left","altText":"Wood","caption":"","fileMasterId":59535051,"fileName":"Fake_woodie_look_went_out_with_the_Chrysler_PT_Cruiser.","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59535051/Fake_woodie_look_went_out_with_the_Chrysler_PT_Cruiser.","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"Raise your hand if you love the <a href=\"(http://www.flickr.com/groups/1432271@N23/\" rel=\"”nofollow\" target=\"”_blank”\">fake woodie look</a>!","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":" I assume no hands are raised.

Always have a place for trash disposal.</h3>\nI have observed that children are willing to be tidy if there is an easy, simply understandable way of cleaning up. You can’t expect little kids to fold their disposable trash into neat quarters and carry it in to the house. Big kids, maybe (but probably not). You <em>can</em> expect them to stuff gum wrappers and junk into the fabric map pockets on the back of the seats, where you'll find it a month later, if you don't have a better option that's just as easy.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"So have a trash bag, such as one of those thin plastic store bags with handles, right at hand. I often put one on the front passenger's-side armrest, where it won’t fall or spill and it’s under the driver’s control.

No trash on the floor or seats = 90 percent of the way to “clean.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>2. Make a place for things that need to stay in the car.</h3> \r\nHave a closed plastic storage crate in the trunk or back hatch, where you keep changes of clothes, clean towels, extra shoes, sports equipment, or whatever else you want to leave in the car. This will prevent seeing the soccer shorts lolling around on the back seat for someone to wipe his or her nose on.

Have a plan for wet/dirty storage.</h3>\r\nWhen my kids were really small—toddler and young elementary age—many were the times I drove them home in only their diapers or underwear because they had jumped straight into the frog pond or totally covered themselves with mud on a hike. You spare yourself hours of interior detailing if you have a wet storage container that separates the muddy socks and the damp bathing suits.

If you spend any amount of time with them, whether taking road trips or just going to after-school music lessons and then soccer practice, they will at least snack in the car. But there are ways to reduce the mess. I always have small kitchen towels on board, and I hand out one per person for their laps and to use as napkins. The towels go into my wet/dirty storage once used, and they have saved the upholstery and my kids’ clothes many times. I also attempt to have everyone eat and then dispose of the trash all in one stop. When (not if) that fails on a longer trip, I go back to rule no. 1 and each person tossing his or her trash into the bag I have cleverly made sure to have on board.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h3>5.

Yes, you can assign your children to take turns cleaning out the car, or stand over them while they remove all their stuff each day. And you should. But to really get that clean-car feeling, the most workable solution I have found over many years is to make it an activity I do for myself, alone. I go off on a Saturday or Sunday, without any kids, and I go through a car wash, vacuum out the car, and get out the Windex and Mr. Clean wipes to freshen the surfaces and get the finger marks off the side windows. It's kind of an enjoyable indulgence, especially when I go out for cappuccino afterward.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"Let’s face it: kids are going to be messy, if they’re doing childhood right.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

It’s not hard to make a—you should excuse the expression—short list. The problem is in deciding on the many tradeoffs. There’s no shortage of cars in the subcompact segment and even the sub-subcompact niche. You’ve got your Mini Coopers, which are charming and sporty. But they can be as expensive as a much larger car, putting them more in the category of a second or third car to own for fun. If you’re going small at least partly to be frugal and not just to be fashionable, it might be out of your price range. You’ve got your Smart Fortwo, which is undeniably cheap and fuel-efficient but comically tiny; the Scion iQ and Fiat 500 are a little more reasonable—but only a little. Going up a bit in size, you’ll find the Honda Fit and the Toyota Yaris, which have more of a standard silhouette, along with decent-size engines and horsepower—but lower fuel economy to match.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"And then there’s the Chevrolet Spark.

Yes, we careened up I-94 through pothole-rich Detroit in a Spark. It was an adventure! I did try to psych myself out a bit by murmuring to myself, “This is a normal-size car.

There’s even a rear spoiler.  And when I took three members of the Jean Knows Cars team on an outing, it seated us all in pleasant comfort.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-04T14:15:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"the weekly windup 10 4 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59774718/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59774718,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-04T14:15:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"the weekly windup 10 4 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59774715/weekly-header.jpg","fileMasterId":59774715,"fileName":"weekly-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-04T14:15:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"the weekly windup 10 4 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59774718/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59774718,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":545414,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Some things we ran across on the way to finding what we were looking for.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact.

At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Soapbox","id":1034787,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/soapbox","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-07T11:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"assembly line birthday","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59856672/EarlyModelT-Assembly.jpg","fileMasterId":59856672,"fileName":"EarlyModelT-Assembly.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-07T11:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"assembly line birthday","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59856570/1914-Ford-Highland-Park-Plant-assembly-line.jpg","fileMasterId":59856570,"fileName":"1914-Ford-Highland-Park-Plant-assembly-line.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-07T11:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"assembly line birthday","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59856672/EarlyModelT-Assembly.jpg","fileMasterId":59856672,"fileName":"EarlyModelT-Assembly.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":545491,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"assembly line birthday","caption":"","fileMasterId":54529952,"fileName":"birthday.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54529952/birthday.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"<h3>THE MOVING ASSEMBLY LINE TURNS 100 TODAY!</h3>\nCan an invention celebrate a birthday?

There, 140 assemblers were stationed along the line to install parts on a chassis that engineers had constructed using a winch and a rope. From this crude beginning, the process quickly evolved. The following year, the rope was replaced by an endless chain. The time it took to produce one vehicle was reduced by over nine hours to fewer than three. Ford had created a win-win: he got filthy rich, and the middle class got to drive cars.\n \nThe idea of moving the product to the worker rather than the worker to the product was revolutionary, and it helped smooth out the pacing of production. By 1916, the number of Model Ts produced reached 585,388, but the big news was the price had been significantly reduced. The Touring model now sold for only $360. According to an inflation calculator, that would equate to roughly $8,500 today.

After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-07T12:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"langlang","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59860761/lang-lang-with-bugatti-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59860761,"fileName":"lang-lang-with-bugatti-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-07T12:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"langlang","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54532100/langlang-header.jpg","fileMasterId":54532100,"fileName":"langlang-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-07T12:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"langlang","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59860761/lang-lang-with-bugatti-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59860761,"fileName":"lang-lang-with-bugatti-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":545486,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"langlang","caption":"","fileMasterId":54532091,"fileName":"langlang_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54532091/langlang_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"If you were going to have a one-of-a-kind car customized in your name, which kind would you choose?
