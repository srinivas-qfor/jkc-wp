The JX is designed to put a major emphasis on family values, without making Mom feel like she’s driving a milk truck. The JX offers stylish design, high interior quality and plenty of room in the second row, where the seats recline and slide forward and backward. The thinking here is that there’s no need to remove a child seat to access the third row. The JX is something of a technological powerhouse as well, with options like a backup collision intervention system, an industry first. If a reversing driver doesn’t spot a car or pedestrian approaching from the side, the JX flashes a warning, then pushes back against the driver’s throttle foot and finally brakes to prevent a crash. The JX’s base price of $41,400, including a $950 destination charge, can rapidly escalate, with the addition of such items as all-wheel drive and five option packages. They include a $4,950 Premium package that includes a navigation system, Around View monitor and a thirteen-speaker Bose sound system. A Driver Assistance package adds another $2,200 to the bottom line and adds the back-up collision intervention system, intelligent cruise control, a blind spot warning system, and heated steering wheel. A $1,700 Theater package bundles dual seven-inch color monitors, two wireless headphones and a 120-volt power outlet. Anyone hauling lots of soccer or hockey equipment should be aware that there is minimal cargo room behind the third row.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong>\r\n6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

For starters, there’s the very competent “regular” CTS, powered by a pair of V-6 engine choices. The rear-wheel-drive CTS sedan and coupe ride on the same wheelbase, but the coupe is about two inches lower and two inches shorter, with a more steeply angled windshield. All three CTS body styles get the same 27 mpg on the highway. Get the Touring or Performance versions for more of a kick, or the Sport Wagon for more versatility. Then there’s the CTS-V, which famously set a speed record at the Nürburgring race circuit in Germany a few years back. It’s set up for performance with Brembo brakes, an airflow-improving grille, performance tires, a set of center-mounted, mouthy tailpipes, and, last but not least, a supercharged V-8 engine that puts out 556 horsepower—and helps limit fuel economy to a maximum of 19 mpg on the highway.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7 to 9","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

So top drawer is the cabin of the M that it can be ordered with a special Japanese ash wood trim with genuine silver embedded in the grain. Of course, the trim is part of a $4,200 premium package. Such packages can raise the price of the M well past the $50,000 mark rapidly. A base M37 starts at $49,095, including an $895 destination charge.

The hybrid version is fast and frugal, returning 27 mpg in city and 32 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. A seven-speed automatic transmission is standard on all models. All-wheel drive is available.

It pulls off the difficult trick of being cushy and rugged all at once – but it is better at hauling people than cargo. Ride and handling are improved since the QX has been designed as an SUV rather than being built off a modified pickup-truck platform. Still, the QX’s snow and tow modes made it a valiant performer in bad weather and boat transportation. It can haul up to 8,500 pounds. Buyers should be prepared to shell out major bucks at the gas pump. Both the rear- and four-wheel drive versions of the QX return only 14 mpg in city driving and 20 mpg on the highway, according to the EPA. The standard 5.6-liter V-8 engine has direct fuel injection and makes 400 horsepower. It is linked to a seven-speed automatic transmission. The enormous SUV can seat up to eight in three rows of leather-lined luxury. Check the box for the no-cost split bench seat if you need room for eight. While 2013 pricing has yet to be announced, expect to pay over $60,000 for the biggest SUV in the Infiniti lineup. The price escalates if you add such options as the $2,950 theater package, which includes dual seven-inch color monitors with wireless remote to keep the kids entertained on long trips.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Every one of them is powered by a 6.2-liter V-8 engine. And if you have a taste for irony, there’s the Escalade Hybrid. Its fuel economy is a fifty percent improvement on the standard model. The ESV is the extended-length version of this SUV, and it’s twenty-one inches longer than the standard model, which is already 202.5 inches long. An eight-inch flip-down screen will help amuse passengers in the third row of the ESV, or take out the third row altogether, fold down the second row, and amuse yourself with 137.4 cubic feet of cargo room. For 2013, the Escalade gets several new metallic paint choices, including Midnight Plum, which is coming later in the year. Even more decorative is the Platinum model, with decorative French seams on the instrument panel, center console, and door trim, plus wood inlays, aniline leather-trimmed seats, heated and cooled cup holders (!), a power lift gate, and a plethora of Cadillac wreath-and-crest logos.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 6.5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors: </strong><br />\n1.

The carryover Forte is available as a sedan, hatchback, and coupe, which Kia calls the Koup. The Forte LX and EX models are equipped with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 156 horsepower. The uplevel Forte SX gets a 173-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. The EPA says the smaller engine with a six-speed automatic transmission returns 26 mpg in city driving and 36 mpg on the highway. The EX model with the 2.0-liter engine can be outfitted with an optional Eco Package that includes a “smart” alternator and low-rolling-resistance silica tires that give the fuel economy a little boost. Competition is heating up in the small-car segment, with the Hyundai Elantra and Ford Focus stealing some of the limelight away from the Forte. Kia is still a good value in the segment, despite the fact that the Forte gets a modest price increase of around $225 for the new model year. Expect to pay $16,175, including a $775 destination charge for the 2013 Forte sedan, $18,175 for the Forte Koup, and $19,075 for the Forte hatchback.

The Midgate lets you fold the rear seats down and extend the pickup bed inside the cabin, giving you a much more useful eight-foot bed. You can also unlatch the rear window and store it inside a recess in the Midgate panel for open-air driving enjoyment. Features and goodies are extensive and include Bose audio, leather-trimmed heated and cooled front seats, and dual-zone climate control. There’s also a standard lockable tonneau cover—although you can take it off to increase storage versatility. Since this is, after all, a sport-utility vehicle turned into a pickup, it shares the same V-8 engine and six-speed automatic transmission as the other Escalades. The Escalade’s all-wheel drive and 7,600-pound towing capacity mean it’s more than just a good-looking luxury vehicle—it’s one you can actually get some utility from.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors: </strong><br />\n1.

For 2013, changes to the SRX are evolutionary. The front upper and lower grilles have been updated, and the interior gets upgraded technology. Among the safety improvements is the interesting Safety Alert Seat, which vibrates one of the driver’s seat bolsters when there’s a perceived danger such as too close proximity to an object such as a tree or another vehicle.  There’s also adaptive cruise control and automatic braking, both of which rely on radar and sensors to the extent of actually putting on the brake for you if danger is imminent. The SRX also has Cadillac’s new Cue information and entertainment system, which triggered a redesign of the intstrument cluster and center stack, plus such luxury amenities as a rearview camera, heated front seats, a leather-trimmed steering wheel—you can get it heated as well—and a power sunroof. Performance and Premium versions get some new twenty-inch wheel designs. You can dress up the SRX’s interior with an all-black look to go with the French stitching and polished chrome, and there’s even sapele wood trim as an option.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7.5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The base Kia Rio returns 30 mpg in city driving and 40 mpg on the highway – sure to make consumers smile in an era of rising gas prices. But the Rio’s optional Idle Stop and Go, or ISG, technology, which helps to cut fuel consumption, is a $400 option. The technology improves fuel economy by turning the engine off when the vehicle is not in motion – such as at a stoplight or in traffic – and automatically restarting when the driver releases the brake pedal. The ISG technology, which is usually offered on hybrids only, is bundled in an Eco package that also includes an Eco badge. The EPA says the Kia Rio Eco returns 31 mpg in city driving and 40 mpg on the highway. The Rio twins are equipped with a 138-horsepower 1.6-liter gasoline direct-injection four-cylinder engine linked to either a six-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission. The Rios get a few upgrades for the new model year, including standard steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters on the SX model. But the bigger news is that prices on the Korean sedan and hatchback continue to climb. The Rio – once the value leader in the segment – is now more expensive than one of its chief competitors, the 2013 Ford Fiesta.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

This new car should help with that. No, the all-new XTS is not a high-performance car—look to Cadillac’s other new model, the ATS, for that—but it still should appeal to many import buyers as well as to the older demographic that Cadillac has long attracted. Why? Because it is straight up hedonistic, with a gorgeously luxuriant interior and a smooth ride in the best large-sedan manner. The feeling starts with Cadillac’s new Cue information and entertainment system, making its debut on the 2013 XTS. Its eight-inch touchscreen incorporates the capacitive touch of an iPhone for a satisfyingly intuitive user experience.  It continues with the Bose audio, leather trim choices all the way up to a buttery full leather interior depending on model, subtle accent lighting, and real wood trim. The XTS is a front-wheel drive car, in contrast to the ATS, and all-wheel drive is available. Its safety systems are as thoroughly indulgent as its luxury equipment. For example, there’s an optional Driver Assistance active safety package that incorporates active short-range radar and a smart camera above the inside mirror that shoots twelve high-definition photos per minute, all in the service of spotting and avoiding hazards. Performance purists may dislike the fact that the XTS has front-wheel drive, but this is probably not the product they’re looking for anyway.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter: </strong>7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"","caption":"","fileMasterId":46421961,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46421961/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors: </strong><br />\n1.

It continues to be a popular choice for families, especially since it can be customized for shoppers on a budget or for those willing to pay more for extras. The base model starts at under $25,000 and is well-equipped. There are three engine choices: a 175-horsepower 2.4-liter inline four-cylinder engine, a 191-horsepower 2.4-liter inline four-cylinder, or a 276-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6. All are linked to a six-speed automatic transmission. The Sorento has an optional third row and seats up to seven passengers. One downside: not only is the third-row cramped, but the side curtain airbag does not cover passengers seated there. Kia continues to up the ante with extras on Sorento. The popular Sorento EX gets standard leather seating trim for the new model year and there is now a standard third-row seat for the Sorento LX V-6. Later in the model year, Kia said it will offer a new LX Convenience Plus Package that bundles an eight-way power driver’s seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, floor mats, and a first-aid kit. The “Buy American” crowd can take heart knowing that the Sorento is built in West Point, Georgia.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Soul gets only a few tweaks for 2013, including power folding outside mirrors standard on the Exclaim model, several new exterior colors, and Bluetooth with steering-wheel mounted audio controls standard on the base manual transmission model. The Soul competes well against other boxy cars, including the Nissan Cube and Scion xB. Soul offers good value for the money, impressive safety features, nice cabin quality, and solid brakes. Buyers can opt for the 138-horsepower 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine or a 164-horsepower four-cylinder engine linked to either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. While it returns decent fuel economy, the Soul falls just short of the 40-mpg Holy Grail. The 1.6-liter model with a six-speed automatic transmission returns 27 mpg in city driving and 35 mpg on the highway. A Soul Eco model with Intelligent Stop and Go technology and an Active Eco system wrings out a bit more fuel economy, returning 29 mpg city and 36 mpg highway. The Eco package is available with either engine. There’s no denying the fun quotient with Soul, even for thrifty-minded buyers. An optional sound system has backlit speakers that can flash in time with the music.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

That really depends on which model you go for. If you are more interested in the handsome low-slung body, the V-6-powered LS coupe and LT convertible may be plenty for you. But if you’re looking for serious performance, there’s the V-8-powered SS coupe and convertible. The manual-transmission SS lets you opt for the track-oriented 1LE performance package, which includes suspension modifications and twenty-inch Goodyear Eagle tires—plus a matte black hood, front splitter, rear-spoiler, and black-finished ten-spoke wheels. Atop the Camaro food chain is the ZL1, new last year, which has a 580-horsepower supercharged V-8, Magnetic Ride Control and an advanced chassis and suspension setup. That’s good for 0 to 60 mph in four seconds, a top speed of 184 mph, and an 11-second quarter-mile time. Chevrolet calls the ZL1 the “everyday supercar.” The ZL1 has started to pass some of its finer qualities down the lineup, with the ZL1-style shift knob, variable-effort electric power steering, and optional dual-mode exhaust now for any manual-transmission Camaro. Inside, the interior is not as buff as the outward appearance, although it does have Chevrolet MyLink and color touchscreen radio, plus optional GPS navigation.

There are two engine choices: the 2.4-liter four-cylinder or Chrysler’s new 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6, which only comes with the Limited sedan.

Although the Sportage is a sibling to the Hyundai Tucson, it gets a unique look inside and out. One downside: the Sportage has less cargo capacity than some of its key competitors. The Sportage got a major redesign two years ago and receives only modest upgrades for the new model year. They include standard power folding outside mirrors, a new blue interior package for the EX model with dark blue cloth seats and a black headliner, standard LED accent lights for the LX and EX models, and a standard sun visor extender on all models. The base Sportage gets a 176-horsepower 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. A standard 260-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline direct injection four-cylinder engine revs up the Sportage SX. While the base Sportage returns 22 mpg in city driving and 32 mpg on the highway, performance enthusiasts won’t pay too great a penalty if they opt for the turbo engine. The EPA says it returns 22 mpg in city driving and 29 mpg on the highway.

The 300 comes standard with an eight-speed automatic transmission, which is usually limited to Italian luxury cars. A 3.6-liter V-6 engine also comes standard, but you can upgrade to a 5.7- or 6.4-liter Hemi V-8. They’re both gas guzzlers, but they make for a great time on the road! Not only is the 300 fun to drive, but with the engine upgrade, you get an entertainment upgrade as well: you can have studio-quality surround sound while you drive thanks to the Beats by Dr. Dre audio system. Premium Nappa leather in Radar Red makes the interior extra sporty and might even make the need for speed a bit harder to resist. But if these extras don’t appeal to you, that’s okay.

This means the California is a bit more tame and rigid, but still sophisticated. It was designed to be easy to drive off the rack; no need for complicated engine configurations. The California is about the experience of driving a Ferrari, not the technical aspects of how it’s done.  The rear accommodates the hard top, so the proportions are not quite as sleek as the other cars in the stellar Ferrari lineup.

Better yet, it is available as a convertible, and Fiat will soon offer a new Turbo model with a beefier engine and a Beats by Dr. Dre sound system for your increased aural pleasure. The 500 earns up to 38 miles per gallon on the highway, depending on the model, and up to 30 miles to the gallon in the city. The interior is distinctive and almost minimalist, with available two-tone seating and a surprisingly uncluttered two-tone dash. If you have a little extra money to spend, a Gucci model is available with the iconic red-and-green stripe adorning the exterior, the seatbelts, and the seatbacks. The seats are also embellished with Gucci leather bearing the fashion house’s logo in either black or white.

The plug-in hybrid Karma is the only Fisker model currently on sale, and with a price hovering around $100,000 it is no impulse buy. The Karma aims to illustrate that environmentally friendly doesn’t mean boring, and in that right they have certainly succeeded. The Karma’s batteries have a range of about fifty miles, after which a gas engine takes over until batteries are recharged. At times, for instance during fast acceleration, the Karma operates using both battery and gas engine power.  For even more eco-friendliness, the Karma has a solar panel roof that increases the electric range by about four to five miles per week. Those extra miles won’t get you far, but it still adds a certain car-of-the-future feel to Fisker’s first offering. When it’s running on electric, the Karma gets an impressive 54 miles to the gallon equivalent. On the gas motor, however, it earns an entirely unimpressive 20-mpg combined. This relatively low number belies the Karma’s true spirit – that of a luxury sports car. With an attractive interior, unforgettable design, and innovative technology, the Karma can’t fail to make a statement.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 9","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

The proof comes from Ford’s all-new C-Max Hybrid and Energi. The compact car is cute in the current Ford style, with wedgy shaping and a toothy grille, but its main selling point is fuel economy. It is rated at 47 mpg both in town and on the highway—which Ford hastens to point out is 7 mpg better than the Toyota Prius v’s highway numbers. The C-Max has a lithium-ion battery that recharges when the gasoline engine is in use; plus, there’s regenerative braking—recycling at its least onerous—which recaptures up to 95 percent of the energy used in braking and uses it to recharge the battery. The C-Max is not only efficient; it also responds to the eco-conscious aesthetic by using a greenery theme in its Smartgauge display, which displays more leaves and vines as a “visual reward” when a driver is more efficient in his or her driving habits. The C-Max’s popular price, starting just over $25,000—lower than its closest rival, the Toyota Prius, and some $10,000 cheaper than the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf—will help it win fans, as will its uncontroversial styling. The fact that you can drive the plug-in Energi at speeds up to 85 mph on electrical power alone should electrify the highway commuter crowd. But the number-one drawing card will be its efficiency in a time of insecure gasoline prices.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Edge can be fitted with a turbocharged four-cylinder or one of two V-6 choices. With the four, fuel economy is 21 mpg in the city and an impressive 30 mpg on the highway, while the V-6s offer 19 mpg in town and 26 or 27 mpg on the highway. All-wheel drive is an option for all models; it cuts fuel economy by about 2 mpg. The Edge offers well-tuned and responsive steering, along with some of the latest in safety technology: roll stability control, side air curtains for the first and second rows of seats, and blind-spot mirrors. A Blind Spot Information System is optional. Ford’s Sync multimedia system and MyFord Touch touchscreen interface are both available on every Edge except for the base model, but prepare for a learning curve. The top-end Edge, the Sport, has the biggest V-6 (305 horsepower) and lots of upscale goodies, including paddle shifters for the six-speed automatic transmission, charcoal leather-trimmed seats with metallic silver inserts, a Sony audio system with HD radio, six-way heated power seats, twenty-inch polished aluminum wheels with black spokes, and chrome oval dual exhaust pipes.

Ford is most proud of the curve control system, which automatically slows down the Escape if it’s taking corners too quickly—a segment first, the automaker notes. At the other end of the spectrum, there’s torque vectoring control, which helps the driver accelerate smoothly through a turn. Looks like Ford has all the bases covered with this five-passenger crossover. Did we mention 33 mpg on the highway, if you opt for the smallest EcoBoost engine?

The rear-wheel-drive Expedition gets 20 mpg on the highway, and the four-wheel-drive version tops out at 18 mpg. Its V-8 engine is flex-fuel capable, however. With a relatively smooth ride thanks to an independent rear suspension, you can relax and enjoy the heavy-duty trailer tow package and integrated trailer brake, should you be planning to use the Expedition for the tough jobs it is intended to handle. You’ll have big choices to make when you shop for an Expedition. It comes in rear- and four-wheel-drive versions, with regular and extended lengths, and in top-end Limited and King Ranch models, for a total of ten versions to choose from.  Dual headrest-mounted DVD systems, twenty-inch chrome-clad aluminum wheels, leather-trimmed heated and cooled seats, metallic running boards, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with wood inserts are among the luxuries found on various models of the Expedition.

But fuel economy is not the main reason for the F-Series; utility is. Besides, every F-Series truck in the Ford lineup has a six-speed automatic transmission, a fuel saver. Ten kinds of F-150s are available, from the workaday XL to the edgy SVT Raptor to the ultra-gussied-up Harley-Davidson F-150 edition. The Raptor is a “performance truck” with a massive 411 horsepower and off-roading amenities including beadlock-capable wheels to keep the tires in place and heavy-duty skid plates to protect the chassis during heavy-duty driving. Seating inside the F-150s runs the gamut from basic on the XL to snakeskin-accented black leather on the Harley-Davidson edition. SuperCab and SuperCrew versions can bring the total passenger volume to six, while the standard F-150 seats three. Among the amenities are power telescoping and power folding trailer-tow side-view mirrors and a set of high-intensity discharge headlamps. An interesting touch is that climate and audio controls are “optimized” for use by those who may be encumbered by wearing heavy work gloves. The F-150 continues to sell so well because it continues to offer utility and practicality in a user-friendly package.

The color palette for the Ford Fiesta is saucy, including choices such as Lime Squeeze and Blue Candy, and you can get interior ambient lighting in seven colors that you can change at will. It has unexpectedly great perks for a subcompact: Ford’s hands-free Sync technology, leather-trimmed seats, push-button start. Even better, the U.S. Fiesta has virtually the same suspension setup as the European model, which means that it handles well and gives you a dynamic driving experience. Your good time behind the wheel is enhanced by knowing that you’re getting great fuel economy: 29 mpg in town and 38 to 40 mpg on the highway, with that higher number accompanying the optional SFE fuel economy package. All that and good looks, too! You might almost be OK with the fact that storage capacity is pretty limited compared with other cars in its category--a mere 12.8 cubic feet for the sedan and up to 26.0 cubic feet in the hatchback with the rear seats down. There’s only one engine choice, a 1.6-liter, 120-horsepower four-cylinder, but two transmission choices: a five-speed manual and a six-speed automatic that’s a little more fuel efficient.

The interior has also been redesigned with new instrument clusters. That could help the multipurpose vehicle—more attractive than a minivan, more carlike than an SUV—get some of the sales momentum it has been lacking. Despite its stance as an anti-minivan, the Flex is very family friendly. A new feature for 2013 is a set of inflatable rear seatbelts—belts with airbags inside, an industry first—that can deploy in 40 milliseconds, a boon to those carrying children or older people as passengers. There’s also a choice of second-row buckets or a bench that gives the Flex room for seven. In the excitement department, the Flex’s new V-6 engine makes 287 horsepower and highway mileage of 25 mpg. An optional EcoBoost V-6 turbo makes an invigorating 355 horsepower and gets 23 mpg on the highway. One of the best things about the Flex is how upscale you can make it: the Titanium appearance package has charcoal leather-trimmed seats with perforated gray leather inserts, a wrapped steering wheel with black bezels and a striking set of twenty-inch wheels.

What a change from the frumpmobile that was the previous Focus.  You can get a sedan or a hatchback, both with four doors and both undeniably easy on the eyes.  Inside, you’ll find a surprisingly comfortable interior both for seating and for cabin amenities. These days, you might be even more impressed to know that a Super Fuel Economy version gets 40 mpg on the highway (and 28 mpg around town). That SFE model comes with the six-speed PowerShift automatic transmission. With a five-speed manual transmission, the standard Focus’s fuel economy is actually lower, although still impressive, at 26 mpg in town and 36 mpg on the highway. Available options include active park assist, Ford’s Sync telematics system with MyFord Touch touchscreen and voice-activated navigation, and an anti-theft engine immobilizer. As attractive as the compact Focus is, there are even more choices in the lineup. There’s the Focus Electric, Ford’s first all-electric vehicle, with a miles per gallon equivalent rating of  110 MPGe city and 99 MPGe highway—and the ability to recharge in as little as four hours.  On the other extreme, the Focus ST is coming later in the year and will offer a turbo four-cylinder engine and sporty performance, optional two-tone Recaro racing seats, and a performance instrument cluster.  Ford says more than 10 million Focus cars have been sold since the first one came out in 1998, and the company is definitely going in the right direction to make that number keep moving upward.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Looks-wise, the new Fusion has a trapezoidal grille, a sleeker body design and a more modern silhouette than the previous model.

The seven-speed transmission, which sits on the rear axle, is recalibrated for faster shifting when the manual mode and aluminum paddle shifters are used. The Adaptive Performance Suspension that features variable, electronically-tuned shock absorbers, now is tuned for stiffer springs and shocks, resulting in a more dynamic feel. To mark the new model, which finds “GT” added to the name, the exterior is festooned anew. Special badges denote the GT, and headlight covers and tail light treatments are darker. The brake calipers now wear a fashionable coat of red. And a high-gloss black finish is added to the front grille trim, side mirrors, and the various fins found on the hood and fenders. Inside the car, red seatbelts provide a sporty contrast with newly added black trim on center console and door panels.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 10","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

It’s the Mick Jagger of cars: even after forty years out on the road, it retains its charisma and appeal. The rear-wheel-drive performance car continues basically unchanged from 2012, although the front and rear have been slightly revised, and the headlamps and taillamps have been modernized. There’s an optional 4.2-inch LCD information screen that offers fuel economy and performance information. The colorful screen’s Track Apps practically beg you to test the car’s (and your) limits with an acceleration timer, brake performance measurements—even a drag strip-style Christmas tree countdown feature. A V-6-powered version of this car gets 31 un-Mustang-like mpg on the highway. On the other hand, those who want to take the V-8-powered Mustang GT out on the track will appreciate the optional GT Track package, which adds an engine cooler, performance brake pads, and other upgrades. The most insane version is the Shelby GT500, which has a 650-horsepower supercharged V-8 and can exceed 200 mph. Slightly more sedate is the Boss 302 Mustang, with its 444 horsepower, six-speed manual transmission, and Recaro racing-style seats, not to mention reflective hockey-stick graphics that are meant to remind you of the 1969 Boss 302. You know what they say: If you remember the '60s, you weren’t there—but the Mustang can drive you back anytime you want.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 8.5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

With a vigorous stance and large wheels and tires, it gains a distinctly new appearance. It also gains a high-tech center console and optional eighteen-way power seats. It loses weight while gaining efficiency, and coupe models gain a sliding glass sunroof. So far, you’ve only counted positives, right? Well, consider that the new, electrically-assisted power steering wins few praises, and the longer wheelbase contributes to a slightly less immediate driving experience. Now the 911 Carrera 4 and 4S all-wheel-drive models, each available as coupe or convertible, have joined the lineup with the rear-drive Carrera (350-horsepower 3.4-liter flat six-cylinder) and Carrera S. With the S, they share the same 400-horsepower 3.8-liter flat six and seven-speed manual or optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, but the all-wheel drive cars are about two inches wider in back to accommodate different hardware and slightly fatter tires. The 4 and 4S introduce active cruise control and crash avoidance systems. If you need something with a top speed as high as 196 mph, the 500-horsepower 911 Turbo and 530-horsepower 911 Turbo S coupe and convertible, based on the previous-generation car, remain on sale.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 10","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Super Duty can be configured in many ways: with a six- or eight-foot bed, single or dual rear wheels, in regular, SuperCab, or SuperCrew body styles, and with a gasoline V-8 or the aforementioned turbo-diesel.

They didn’t mess it up! While looking similar to its precursor, it benefits from a subtle redefinition that makes the bodywork even more handsome and the shape more evocative. (And it looks less like the Porsche 911 than before.) An array of striking exterior colors and bold, or even shocking, interior upholstery combinations can be summoned as a way of making your Boxster extra special. There are even three different steering wheels among your choices. The Boxster now has a 265-horsepower 2.7-liter flat six-cylinder while the Boxster S has a 315-horsepower 3.4-liter flat six. A six-speed manual gearbox is standard with the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic optional. The latter transmission is faster actin’ than Tinactin. As a fuel-saving ploy, the new “coasting” mode decouples the engine from the wheels when the car is coasting, thereby reducing friction. But when the driver is in a fractious frame of mind and seeks unruliness, the available Sport Chrono feature manages all onboard systems and helps the car achieve its highest performance. So equipped, the S will sprint from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.7 seconds.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 10","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

For 2013, Ford has given the car a face-lift and added technological appeal. Torque vectoring control and curve control will add to driving fun as well as make the car safer, and a newly optional 2.0-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engine means the Taurus should get up to 31 mpg on the highway. Even with the standard 3.5-liter V-6, you should look for 19 mpg in town and 29 mpg on the highway, improved numbers and not bad for a capacious sedan. Both engines come with a six-speed automatic transmission. Among the options: a rearview camera, intelligent access with push-button start, a heated steering wheel, and multicontour seats with “subtle rolling massage.” Taurus and “subtle” do go well together. However, if you are feeling a little less subtle yourself, there’s the Taurus SHO, which has an aggressive front end dressed in black mesh, plus bigger brakes and a Performance package that includes a set of twenty-inch wheels.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 4","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Every Cayenne has the most amazing brakes you’ll find on an SUV. If Facebook stock’s performance ever matched that of the Cayenne, Mark Zuckerberg could buy Canada. On top of this, the interior is luxurious and the instrument display and center controls would be the envy of many spaceship commanders. The 420 horsepower GTS, with its 4.8-liter V-8, had been the line-up’s newbie, producing 20 horsepower more than the S, but the Diesel came along this fall. It has a 3.0-liter V-6, and although the 240 horsepower doesn’t seem that impressive, there’s plenty of whomp with 406 lb-ft. of torque. Rather than part-time all-wheel drive, the Diesel’s system is permanent. And of course, the S Hybrid achieves the highest efficiency numbers. Adaptive cruise control, lane-change assist, and a backup camera make the Cayenne driver’s life easier. Any complaints?

The load height is less than two feet, you can get doors that open up 255 degrees wide, and the turning circle is tight enough for the middle of downtown. The Transit Connect is highly modular, with all manner of bins and storage racks to choose for a custom setup. It’s also offered in alternative fuel (LPG or CNG) and electric versions and, to Ford’s credit, with a Motoring Mobility package for those with physical challenges. Use it as a cargo hauler with seats for two, or get it with a folding second row of seats so it can carry four or five people. It even gets 27 mpg on the highway.

(These latter two items can be added at no cost, but R owners will just have to live with the rope burn.) The R is motivated by a 330-horsepower 3.4-liter flat six-cylinder, with output modulated through a six-speed manual transmission. The base model Cayman comes with a 265-horsepower, 2.9-liter flat six, while the Cayman S has a slightly less prodigious versions of the larger engine. A fast-shifting, seven-speed dual-clutch automatic is available. While the R is for hardcore enthusiasts who participate in track day events, the three other models can be equipped with infotainment hardware and fitted with luxurious touches. Please note: the Cayman is about to be replaced, which some people might see as a bad thing. The new one is likely to have the electric power steering that has drawn complaints in the Porsche 911 and Boxster.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 10","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

What else is about eight inches shorter than a Honda Odyssey minivan but only seats four people? Brilliant! Over an approximately $100,000 range from low to high in sticker prices, there are six models: Panamera, S, 4, 4S, GTS, S Hybrid, Turbo, and Turbo S. Engines range from a 300-horsepower V-6 that will hurl this car to 160 mph, to the 550-horsepower turbocharged 4.8-liter V-8 that NASA couldn’t get for spaceflight. It’s also available with all-wheel drive. Meanwhile, the S Hybrid achieves 30 mpg and a modicum of respectability at the e-waste drop-off site. The Hybrid is equipped with an eight-speed. Of course you can expect every safety, driver-assistance, chassis-control, and comfort feature available in the Porsche arsenal; then also imagine paint and leather upholstery that matches your own beloved sample.

The new Accord will also offer SMS functionality for phones with Bluetooth capability. The Accord’s interior isn’t quite luxurious, but it is functional. That is not to say it is completely devoid of innovation, though. A new feature in the top trim level delivers a push-button start option to this practical commuter car. The redesign should offer some excitement to the brand, and a new reason to buy perhaps the most practical car on the market.

They may not belong to one of the more recent model years, but there’s a reason why so many people are still driving their ten-year-old Foresters in 2012 and it’s the reason why you should take a look at a 2013 model if you’re looking for a new crossover. It’s a basic vehicle that can take the wear and tear accompanied with carting around luggage, athletic gear, and even the family dog. If you’re an outdoor enthusiast, that is definitely a plus. The 2.4-liter Boxer engine will give you a fuel economy of 21 mpg city and 27 mpg highway, which is an increase from 2011’s rating. If you want to enhance your driving experience, look into the models with the 224-horsepower turbocharged engine. For your driving safety and convenience, you can opt for adding a voice-activated navigation system to your Forester and one of two winter weather packages. Possibly the best thing about the Forester, besides its durability, is the all-wheel drive, which comes standard on all Subaru vehicles and will be with you for the years to come.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6<br />","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors: </strong><br />\n1.\tFord Escape<br />\n2.\tHonda CR-V<br />\n3.\tKia Sportage<br />","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":41855942,"fileName":"Cool_Tech.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/41855942/Cool_Tech.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":57},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":63}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Cool Tech: </strong><br />\n1.

The Crosstour shares much of what’s inside with the Accord, including the engine and suspension. It also makes use of variable cylinder management, which allows the car to adjust its power to the demands of the driver and increases fuel economy. The 2013 model will come with Honda’s new safety equipment, including blind spot cameras, lane departure warning, and front collision warning. The Crosstour distinguishes itself from Honda’s other mid-size cars not only in its styling, but with its much greater capacity. With 25.7 cubic feet of cargo space, it has just about twice as much space as the Accord or Civic. Despite being one of only four Honda models not rated above 30 mpg on the highway, it still gets a relatively strong 25 to 27 mpg highway and 17 to 18 mpg in the city, enough to incite gas-pump envy from plenty of drivers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

Based on Toyota’s “compact” Tacoma pickup, the 4Runner is still an excellent off-roader. However, with the whimsically styled and even more off-road-inclined FJ Cruiser also in the 2013 lineup, Toyota has taken the 4Runner’s trim levels considerably upmarket. Particularly in the fancy Limited grade, with standard leather seating, push-button start, navigation, and a slew of options including a fifteen-speaker sound system, the 4Runner is downright posh. Powering the 4Runner is a grunty, if a tad raucous, 270-horsepower 4.0-liter V-6 paired with a five-speed automatic—not the most sophisticated powerplant in the Toyota lineup but entirely capable. (If you’re looking for a smooth operator, check out the Highlander crossover.) Fuel economy is so-so, but to its credit, an eco-driving feedback system allows the driver to see just how much gas the vehicle is swilling at any given time. Off-roading remains a specialty for the 4Runner; particularly in Trail grade, no mid-size SUVs other than the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the aforementioned FJ Cruiser can keep up with the 4Runner once the pavement ends. Our favorite 4Runner feature, however (standard on all trim levels, thankfully), is the stereo, with its outward-facing speakers in the back for tailgate parties.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Honda’s biggest crossover offers 1,500 pounds of towing and 37 cubic feet of cargo space even with the rear seats up, giving it plenty of room for errands around town or family road trips. The engine has spirit, and the car’s steering and handling are assets, especially for its size. Honda didn’t do much to change the CR-V’s interior or exterior styling, but that might be because the existing model worked fairly well. The CR-V has intuitive controls, though it’s navigation system could use an update. Right in the middle of Honda’s price range, the CR-V has a base price topping out just above $30,000. This also makes it one of the cheaper utilitarian vehicles on the market, easily beating the price of larger SUVs while still providing impressive capacity.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

As the Toyota brand’s flagship, the Avalon has enjoyed popularity among the retiree set as well as among satisfied Camry customers who simply want a little bit more, in the form of an extra-wide cabin, a Costco-grade trunk, a high level of creature comforts, and a schmaltzy ride. But the all-new 2013 Avalon has evolved into something more than a Camry. It has become lighter in weight and shorter in both height and length, making it one of the more garage-friendly full-size sedans around. Just as significant, the Avalon has upgraded almost everything under the skin, and now it shares pretty much all of its innards with none other than the slick new 2013 Lexus ES. Like the Lexus, the Avalon is powered by a silken, powerful 3.5-liter V-6 with 268 horsepower in standard form, or a four-cylinder/electric powertrain combo in the new-for-2013 Avalon hybrid that scores an EPA rating of 40 mpg. The 2013 Avalon was designed in California and brandishes a glitzy new grille, LED running lamps, sweeping body sides, and an elegantly arching roof. But the Avalon’s new interior may be its best attribute, offering not just tons of space but far more luxury experience than ever, thanks to additional sound-deadening materials, hand-stitched dash covers, capacitive touch controls, and lots of fancy options including heated front and rear seats and soft ambient lighting.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The hatchback’s low back end limits rear visibility, but the tight squeeze fits with the character of the car, though, and the 122 horsepower engine is able to provide some fun for the driver while still handling well. There are also three available drive modes, so that the driver can decide whether to conserve fuel or pump up the performance. The CR-Z gets a wallet-friendly 35 mpg in the city and 39 mpg highway.  Priced at $20,000 to $24,000, the CR-Z keeps with Honda’s tradition of offering impressive fuel economy without forcing you to mortgage your house, but if extra seating or cargo room are of any concern it might make sense to look at one of Honda’s hybrid sedans. On the other hand, if you don’t have kids or equipment to haul around (or if you make the kids walk so you can keep your sweet ride) the CR-Z is certainly worth a look.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Still looking fresh after its complete redesign for the 2012 model year, Toyota’s perennial bestseller is unchanged for 2013, and that’s generally fine by us, as Toyota did a remarkable job adding emotion to the Camry this time around (not too much, of course…2012 is an election year, after all). Not only does its styling actually convey, well, actual style from its broad, beveled mug to its chunky, L-shaped taillamps, but it drives pretty well, too, with taut suspensions and communicative steering. Three engine choices await customers, including a frugal 178-horsepower four-cylinder, a velvety 268-horsepower V-6, and a four-cylinder/electric hybrid, the latter helping the Camry hybrid achieve an impressive 41-mpg rating from the EPA. The interior still suffers from some corporate boardroom austerity, but it is comfortably equipped even in base form and feels Lexus-like in uplevel XLE form. And of course, since it’s a Toyota, assembly quality is pretty spectacular. As good as it is, however, the Camry will have a tougher time than ever keeping its sales crown this year, with stiff new competition coming from the Ford Fusion, the Chevrolet Malibu, the Nissan Altima, and the Camry’s arch-nemesis, the Honda Accord, each of which should also be checked out by mid-size sedan shoppers before plunking down their money for a Camry.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

And now, it is undeniable: the Corolla is getting old. Of course, that hasn’t stopped people from buying Corollas in droves. And so with an audible sigh, we report that 2013 brings yet another mild update to a car that has been around in its current form seemingly for an eternity. So why do people still buy the Corolla en masse? Simple: it’s simple…as in uncomplicated, plain, or as some might say, dull. And to be fair, one person’s dull is another’s “reliable transportation,” and don’t expect us to argue with that. But don’t expect us to get too excited about it, either, as the only available engine remains a wimpy 132-horsepower 1.8-liter four-cylinder mated to five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmissions. The Corolla LE and S models receive some reconstituted option packages, and a new 6.1-inch screen-based interface for the Display Audio system. Fuel economy is respectable but falls short of newer, fresher, and far more exciting competitors such as the Ford Focus, the Chevrolet Cruze, the Volkswagen Jetta, and the Hyundai Elantra, all of which should be considered by anyone looking at a new Corolla this year.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 3","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

With that in mind, consider the Highlander the very quintessence of the brand. Bringing all the style and comfort of a sensible shoe, the Highlander is perfect for people who don’t like to think too much about their vehicles at any point, whether it’s before, during, or after acquiring them. The Highlander is larger than Toyota’s RAV4 and Venza crossovers, yet it remains carlike next to the similarly sized and priced 4Runner. It features a second-row seat that can be equipped either with captain’s chairs or a bench, plus a standard third-row seat for a maximum capacity of seven souls. With base, SE, and Limited trim levels and a new Highlander Plus package available for the base model, the Highlander can be equipped either as a bare-bones kid shuttle or the next best thing to a Lexus. The Highlander breaks little new ground this year in technology, either inside the vehicle or under the skin, with the exception being the Highlander hybrid, which is offered in addition to the four-cylinder (front-wheel drive only) and V-6 models. But that’s okay, since the Highlander is pretty swell as is.

The Insight melds the interior of several other Honda sedans, creating an appealing Frankenstein’s monster of ergonomic controls.  The interior also offers plenty of hiding spots and storage space for whatever you carry around. Perhaps the Insight’s biggest draw is its price, with a base price below $20,000. The low price isn’t without drawbacks, however, and the Insight can be rough on bumpy roads and loud at high speeds.  Honda didn’t skimp on safety, though, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated the Insight as a Top Safety Pick. With rear seats down the cargo space – already respectable for a small car – almost doubles. The Insight’s charms and price are enough to make up for some minor deficiencies, and it is a good choice if you’re looking for a hybrid that doesn't break the bank.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

As anyone from a very large family can likely attest, it’s challenging for each member to stand out. Such is the case with the poor Matrix, essentially a tall Corolla wagon styled like a crossover. Splitting the difference between the bargain-basement Yaris and the big-boned, Camry-based Venza in body style and price point, the Matrix is ideally packaged for the  young family and the empty nester. But evidence of willful neglect on the part of the parent company shows up in the general lack of updates Toyota has given the Matrix since its last redesign four years ago. The 2013 changes are mostly limited to audio systems with Bluetooth and USB connectivity (at last!), and a touchscreen interface for the upgrade system. All-wheel drive remains available, as do two four-cylinder engine choices: a 132-horsepower 1.8-liter and a 158-horsepower 2.4-liter—but, thanks in part to subpar transmissions, the Matrix remains less than competitive in fuel economy. Factor in a conspicuously cheap interior and lack of overall pizzazz, and it’s easy to understand why the Matrix has a tough time standing out.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 4","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Along with Honda’s dowdy Insight, the Prius c was designed to satisfy the burgeoning demand for more affordable hybrids. Although it is hardly a thing of beauty, it is easier to look at than the regular Prius, with its more conventional profile and whimsical color palette. Heck, we give it a pass simply for not looking “like a hybrid” (i.e., doorstop chic). We can’t give it the same kudos for the way it drives, as it is suuuh-looooow, with a total of just 99 horsepower combined between its gasoline and electric powertrains. Yawn. Worse still is that it isn’t any more fuel efficient overall than the heavier, more powerful non-c Prius, which gets the same 50 mpg combined fuel economy rating from the EPA. Like the Prius, the c model does have an EV mode, which allows parking lot cruising to be done (up to a mile at speeds up to 25 mph) purely on electricity. But again, the whole point of the Prius c is not to out-Prius the Prius but to come in at a lower price point, and that it does, some $4,000 to $5,000 less than its bigger brother Prius. Even with all the bells and whistles, which include automatic climate control, push-button starting, fancy Display audio system with touchscreen operation, power exterior mirrors, heated seats, and more, the Prius c costs barely more than the lowest grade of standard Prius. For a 50-mpg car, that’s a pretty good deal.

Typical of the Honda brand, the Pilot is known for its reliability and utility. It is one of the best-selling vehicles in its category, even outdoing cars that are better looking and more powerful than the boxy Pilot. Like Honda’s other utility vehicles, the Pilot can be pricey. The base price for the cheapest model is almost $30,000, and the price range tops out above $41,000, making the Pilot one of only two Hondas with a base price that high, but if you can get past the price and polarizing exterior styling, the Pilot is a versatile choice.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

Do the same thing again and again and don’t change much. Toyota certainly struck gold with its 50-mpg Prius hybrid, so last year, it took the Prius’s winning formula, added a model with a little more cargo space (and, according to some, better-looking styling), and called it the Prius v. Shortly thereafter, Toyota created the Prius Plug-in, which uses the same wedgy body of the workaday Prius but gets super-potent batteries that can be recharged in three hours from a standard power outlet, thus helping it travel up to fifteen miles at speeds up to 62 miles per hour on electricity alone.  Note, to stay in electric power, you have to go seriously easy on the go pedal, as the gas engine will fire up at the slightest provocation or incline. This makes driving an un-fun vehicle even less fun, but the payoff comes in stratospheric EPA-rated fuel economy of 87 MPGe. The catch? At nearly $33,000 before options, the plug-in model costs considerably more than the standard Prius. But for now, the Prius Plug-in remains the closest thing Toyota has to an extended-range electric vehicle like the Chevrolet Volt. Given the busy year it had in 2012, the Prius doesn’t change much for 2013, with the only noteworthy news being addition of the new Prius Persona Series, available in black, white, or new Black Cherry Pearl with seventeen-inch wheels, charcoal SofTex interior, and some dark chrome interior trim.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 3","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

It bucks traditional pickup build by being the only mid-size truck on the market with a cab and truck bed built in one piece, meaning that the sections don’t bounce around separately while driving. This gives the Ridgeline a smoother ride than many pickups, while still maintaining the convenience of an open-bed truck. It is, however, significantly more expensive than many of its competitors, with a base price range in the $30,000s. The Ridgeline has a 250-horsepower V-6 engine and is rated to tow 5,000 pounds. With four doors and two rows of seats, the Ridgeline can seat five, though the cabin is not appointed quite as well as the rest of Honda’s fleet. As if the Ridgeline needed any more cargo space, there is a lockable in-bed trunk with 8.5 cubic feet of storage for anything you don’t want flying around the truck bed.

We expect, however, that Toyota dealers may have a few 2012 RAV4s sitting around well into 2013, so what about that model? Well, the gen-three RAV4 has never been a shabby ride, having grown about as large as a compact crossover can get and still be considered “compact.” It even offers a vestigial third-row seat, although that’s a place we only recommend for compact people. The front two rows offer good views and space for four adults, and spendy types can select from a laundry list of options, including leather seats, navigation, and an audio system with EnTune data services and iTunes song tagging. Both of the RAV4’s available engines, a somewhat overburdened 179-horsepower four-cylinder and a 269-horsepower V-6, are available with front- or all-wheel drive. We prefer the V-6 not just for its passing power, but because its highway fuel economy remains close to that of the four-cylinder. California residents may also consider the new, all-electric RAV4, which was introduced in late 2012 for about $50,000, minus a $7,500 federal tax credit and a $2,500 state tax credit. Based on the 2012 model with some cosmetic refinements that make it both more distinct and more aerodynamic, the RAV4 EV is expected to continue unchanged well beyond the introduction of the all-new 2013 RAV4, which is set to make its debut by the end of 2012.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 5","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

Huge, clean, and full of storage cubbies and sliding things, the Sienna could double as a hospital if it only came with a gurney. But there’s more to the Sienna than just seats and space. Five trim levels are available, ranging from basic to truly luxurious, with a surprisingly decent-looking SE model adding a touch of sportiness to the lineup. As with most of its competitors, the Sienna can host up to eight at a time, with seats that can be inclined, reclined, slid, stowed, and flattened in countless combinations. One particularly cool feature is the 16.4-inch-wide, remote-controlled rear entertainment screen that can play two different videos side by side. Another is the nifty front center console that can be slid rearward so second-row occupants can reach it. The sole powerplant is Toyota’s smooth and quiet 266-horsepower V-6, mated to a six-speed automatic transmission, which helps it achieve a respectable 18/25 mpg city/highway fuel economy rating from the EPA. The Honda Odyssey may be better-looking and the Chrysler Town & Country more fun to drive, but neither will have an easy time keeping up with the Sienna on a snowy road, as the Sienna is the industry’s first minivan to offer all-wheel drive (although choosing one so equipped drops fuel economy by two miles per gallon). If there’s a bone to pick with the Sienna, it’s that it is simply not very emotional.

Thank Toyota’s steady-handed stewardship of its signature truck for its intensely loyal following that has kept the model selling in droves even as competitors have come and gone. In 2013, the Tacoma’s sole direct competitor is the comparatively gruff Nissan Frontier, and with its winning combination of slick looks, sterling build quality, bountiful comfort levels, and cab styles (including a simple standard cab model), the Tacoma is arguably the superior of the two. The Tacoma looks particularly good as the low-riding XRunner and the high-riding PreRunner, the latter even more so when you splurge on the T|X and T|X Pro packages. Anyone fancying a bit more cush should like the new Limited grade, with its chrome exterior trim, metallic dash surfaces, heated front seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and more.

It seats four, just like a Porsche Panamera, but you won’t feel anything is wasted. The C30 is available in T5 and T5 R-Design versions, each with Premier, Premier Plus, and Platinum trim levels. The Platinum includes power-operated front seats and sunroof, keyless start, active Xenon headlamps, navigation, and a killer sound system. The C30 Polestar Limited Edition makes its debut in October, but only 250 examples--all in the same hue of Rebel Blue--will reach American showrooms. Polestar is Volvo’s performance subbrand, similar to M at BMW and AMG at Mercedes-Benz; revisions to the engine result in 250 horsepower, and the car rides on unique matte black seventeen-inch wheels. Premier Plus trim is standard for the Polestar, with Platinum optional.

Standard features now include air-conditioning, remote keyless entry, an audio system with six speakers, heated side mirrors, body-colored door handles, and a sunglasses holder. The Accent even gets a new, optional power sunroof on the SE model. But shoppers should be aware that the base Accent is now more expensive than several of its key competitors, including the base 2013 Ford Fiesta S sedan. The Accent is a mighty performer and won’t disappoint at the pump. It is equipped with a 138-horsepower 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine linked to either an optional six-speed automatic transmission or standard six-speed manual transmission. The EPA says that either powertrain configuration will return 30 mpg in city driving and 40 mpg on the highway. Much of Accent’s competition does not hit that magic 40 mpg mark. Six air bags are standard on the Accent and there’s no skimping on styling, thanks to Accent’s newer sculptured look. Five-door Accent SE models get a sporty roof-mounted spoiler and vertical taillights, dressing up the subcompact even more.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

(There’s even an available Climate package with heated front seats and an interior air quality system.) At the touch of a button, the top goes through its contortions in thirty seconds.

The available Dynamic package adds eighteen-inch wheels, active Xenon headlamps, and a sport steering wheel with aluminum inlays. For a broad upgrade in performance and luxury, add the Inscription package, which first and foremost boosts the engine’s output to 250 horsepower. The Inscription also includes gloss black trim rather than bright pieces, black wheels, a leather-covered dashboard, and rich leather upholstery.

Like the optional engines in the C30 and C70, the T5’s turbocharged 2.5-liter five-cylinder engine makes 250 horsepower. The T6 AWD has a 300-horsepower 3.0-liter turbocharged six (325 horsepower in the R-Design model), and all-wheel drive is standard. A six-speed automatic transmission is included with all models. Trim levels are Premier, Premier Plus, and Platinum. The latter adds navigation, a premium sound system, a backup camera, an integrated garage door opener, and active Xenon headlamps. Front and rear parking assistance is available on the R-Design. The S60 keeps up in the technology race, too, adding the standard Personal Car Communicator, first introduced in the S80, which knows from a distance if the car is locked and, thanks to a heartbeat sensor, if an intruder is inside. It even turns on all lights as you approach your car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The company now applies the word “exclusive” to the car, although this is because it doesn’t sell very well. The only good explanation for the slow sales, though, is that snob appeal is lacking. This handsome, if understated, sedan is smooth on the road and well equipped. It offers a good value equation. You’ll find such unexpected standard features as Volvo’s City Safety system for avoiding low-speed collisions and the available blind spot monitoring and pedestrian detection. The cabin, richly appointed with leather and walnut, can be overpopulated with twelve speakers for a wonderful music environment. Americans choose from two models. The 3.2 is powered by a 240-horsepower 3.2-liter six-cylinder engine. A smaller, turbocharged 3.0-liter six makes 300 horsepower to move the T6 AWD smartly down the road. The two models share the same six-speed automatic. The S80 is Volvo’s technology leader: it introduced keyless start and Personal Car Communicator, a key fob that foretells unlocked doors and vehicle intrusion, and this is now standard. A smartphone app is also available for staying connected with the S80. Anyone seeking value and high-level content wouldn’t be called a rotten herring for picking the S80.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Azera received lots of kudos for its redesign, which includes a more contemporary look courtesy of the Korean automaker’s fluidic styling, a roomy cabin and an affordable price tag in the neighborhood of $33,000. The Azera is an excellent choice, especially when you compare it to more expensive Hyundai offerings, including the $60,000 Hyundai Equus. Buyers who want extra pampering can opt for a $4,000 technology package that bundles such items as a panoramic moonroof, xenon headlights, rear sunshades, and a powerful stereo. An unusual feature is a standard navigation system with a rear backup camera. Another plus is that the navigation system is one of the easiest to use in this segment. The Azera is equipped with a 293-horsepower direct-injection 3.3-liter V-6 engine linked to a six-speed automatic transmission. Gas mileage is good at 20 mpg in the city and 30 on the highway, but not as good as some of Azera’s key domestic competitors, including the 2013 Ford Taurus. The Azera has been criticized for its artificial steering feel, some visibility issues, and some cabin trim that may not feel quite as luxurious as it should. But it’s become a solid choice for shoppers who need a large sedan and don’t want to pay a fortune for a deluxe look and lots of standard equipment. The Azera is no longer a Lexus wannabe. It has come into its own.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

The Elantra, which was named the 2012 North American Car of the Year by a very picky panel of automotive journalists, is one of the best small cars on the market. The Elantra GT offers a sportier ride than the sedan version, along with a roomy cabin. The base Elantra sedan takes a lot of anxiety away at the gas pump, since it returns 40 mpg on the highway. The Elantra GT falls just short of that, delivering 39 mpg on the highway. Standard features on the 2013 Elantra GT include a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 148 horsepower, heated front seats, seventeen-inch alloy wheels, and seven airbags. The Elantra GT starts at $19,170, including a $775 destination charge. A GT Style package for both versions of the Elantra GT is priced at $2,750 and adds such items as seventeen-inch alloy wheels, sport-tuned suspension, panoramic sunroof, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and aluminum pedals. A GT Technology package for both versions of the Elantra GT is priced at $2,350 and adds a navigation system, rearview camera, automatic headlights, and dual automatic temperature control. This option requires the Style package, noted Hyundai. If your shopping list includes such mainstays as the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, you’d be remiss not to take a test drive in the Elantra.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors </strong><br />\n1.

Nevertheless, a market niche remains, and the XC70 continues to occupy it. Two versions are available: the 3.2 and the T6 AWD. The former’s 3.2-liter six-cylinder makes 240 horsepower, while the latter’s turbocharged 3.0-liter six makes 300 horsepower. A six-speed automatic is included with either model. Beyond the base 3.2 are Premier, Premier Plus, and Platinum trim levels, while the T6 AWD also comes in Premier Plus and Platinum trim. The T6 AWD comes with a remote garage door opener, keyless start with a key fob that plays detective before you open the door, active Xenon headlamps that look around the corners for you, a power moonroof and tailgate, and other amenities.

In that case, expect to pay over $67,000 for the 2013 Equus Ultimate edition. Despite the price increase, the Equus is still a relative bargain compared to most of the competition, including the Lexus LS 460 and BMW 750i sedan. The 2013 Equus is a carryover model with only minor upgrades. Last year, the Equus got major powertrain upgrades. It is equipped with a 429-horsepower 5.0-liter V-8 engine linked to an eight-speed automatic transmission.  Highlights for 2013 include a new White Satin exterior paint with a Saddle interior color combination. A new Gran Premio Gray exterior paint will also be available. Lots of attention is paid to ritzy touches on the Equus, including a leather-wrapped, French stitched instrument panel, a wood-and-heated leather steering wheel, and a massaging driver’s seat. The Equus is loaded with safety features, including nine air bags, smart cruise control, and a standard lane departure warning system. As Korean automaker Hyundai continues to burnish its image, it has rolled out the white-glove treatment for Equus owners. They can have the Equus picked up at their home or business for service appointments and get a complimentary loaner vehicle.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1. 2013 Lexus LS 460<br />\n2. 2013 Mercedes-Benz S550<br />\n3.

Hyundai says this has been done to simplify the lineup, but in reality, the two discontinued models lagged behind the 333-horsepower 3.8-liter V-6 engine models in terms of fuel-economy ratings. Hyundai has positioned itself as a fuel-economy leader in the U.S. The 3.8-liter V-6 variants of the Genesis return 19 mpg in city driving and 29 mpg on the highway. The V-6 models are available in three equipment configurations for the 2013. All models are equipped with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The 2013 Genesis gets a few tweaks in advance of an anticipated redesign in 2014. The minor changes include a new optional eight-inch display with navigation and an enhanced multi-media controller and Driver Information System. The Hyundai Blue Link telematics system is now optional with the Ultimate Navigation package.  The Genesis has a pleasing design and such exterior details as standard seventeen-inch alloy wheels. Safety features include eight standard air bags and an optional lane departure warning system on the 3.8 Technology package and 5.0 R-Spec models.

With a powerful V-6 engine, eight-speed automatic transmission, a tow rating of 7,700 pounds, and a massive cargo hold, the only thing that holds it in the crossover category is the lack of a third row. Volkswagen almost makes up for this with the large cargo area and a rear seat that splits three ways for convenient folding, but the fact is that if you absolutely need a seven-seater, the Touareg won’t do the trick. The Touareg is far and away Volkswagen’s most expensive car, with a price range topping $60,000. The car is also far and away Volkswagen’s most luxurious offering, with walnut wood accents, available leather seats, and various available sound systems that will blast your eardrums into submission. The fuel economy is decent for a car this size, especially if you choose the diesel engine or the V-6 hybrid. If you’re more concerned with brand cachet than quality or functionality, you should spring for an Audi or a BMW. But lacking a luxury brand badge doesn’t make the Touareg any less of a car, and it is certainly Volkswagen’s best option for SUV-seekers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

The new, 240-horsepower turbocharged engine gets 29 mpg on the highway, which isn’t too bad for a mid-size sedan. For those with a need for speed, there is the option of the new supercharged V-6, which replaces a five-liter V-8. What is neat about the V-6 is that not only does it come with Jaguar’s own all-wheel drive system, but it is also pretty fuel-efficient. If you want to throw caution to the wind completely, give the performance XFR a whirl, which puts the \"R\" in \"racy.\" If you still aren’t sold, just remember that the beauty of a Jaguar sedan is that you can pretty much take it anywhere, somewhat like a perfect little black dress that can be dressed up or dressed down.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong><br />\n1.

If you like exclusivity, the Supersport can only be purchased by custom order, which will grab you a supercharged 510-horsepower V-8 engine, leather headliner, and laser-engraved veneers. It’s still missing desirable features like Google Maps and in-car Internet. You can grow an extra 5.1 inches in the long-wheelbase version. Like the XF, the XJ adds all-wheel drive to its options for 2013. The lightweight aluminum structure makes the XJ a more graceful car than it’s considerable proportions would indicate. The AWD-equipped XJ is expected to deliver 25 mpg on the highway, which is pretty darn good for such a big boss car. The company adds the British-branded Meridian audio system for an all-encompassing sonic experience.

The front and second rows have roomy captain's seats, available in leather or leatherette. Perhaps the Routan’s most impressive features are its thirteen cupholders, including four mounted on a sliding center console. It’s not entirely clear why thirteen cupholders are necessary in a car whose maximum capacity is seven, but Volkswagen certainly has not skimped on convenience. The V-6 engine is powerful enough to carry a loaded Routan, though this has a predictable negative impact on the Routan’s fuel economy.

A navigation system is available, as is phone connectivity. The standard media outfit includes an MP3 jack and Sirius satellite radio is an option.

Luckily, the Passat retains its well-balanced ride and plush interior, and for the daily commute or shuttling the kids around, the tamed Passat will do just fine. The Passat’s base models don’t have fantastic gas mileage, but a TDI clean diesel option gets 31 miles to the gallon in the city and 43 miles a gallon on the highway, almost as good as some hybrid models. The exterior is smooth and well built, but largely unremarkable. Where the Passat shines is in its interior, which looks like that of a more expensive car. Available features include leather seats, chrome trim, a touchscreen radio, a sunroof and a navigation system. Bluetooth connectivity comes standard.

The Grand Cherokee is more than capable off-road with various drive and suspension settings to fit the demands of the trail. Better yet, the Grand Cherokee has retained its ability to drive the back roads without skimping on the interior. With four different trim levels and the SRT8 model, interior choices range from just plain comfortable to quite luxurious, with the top of the line Grand Cherokee boasting leather bucket seats and wood accents throughout the cabin. An optional navigation system includes voice recognition and Sirius Real Time Traffic information so you can skirt the crowds on your way out of town. If this Jeep sounds too good to be true, the fuel economy should sober you up. The Grand Cherokee barely tops 20 miles to the gallon on the highway, and claims the lowest mileage of Jeep’s fleet quite easily.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

In addition to minor interior enhancements for all models, the Jetta has added a new trim level in 2013 with standard navigation system and Fender audio system to compensate for the less-swanky interior. Also new for 2013 will be a Jetta Hybrid, to be released in the fall. Volkswagen expects the car to get 45 mpg, but what they’re really excited about is the hybrid’s ability to reach speeds of up to 185 miles per hour, making it the world’s fastest hybrid (so far). You won’t get great gas mileage going that fast, but you will have the pleasure of knowing that your car could blast anyone else’s out of the park, if you weren’t stuck in gridlock. If hybrids aren’t your speed, the Jetta also offers a fuel-efficient diesel model and a performance-friendly GLI trim level.

The Liberty won’t disappoint on space, with more cargo room than any Jeep but the Grand Cherokee, and it is tow rated at up to 5,000 pounds depending on the model. Its fuel economy is typical of Jeeps (which is to say not very good) at 15 to 16 mpg in the city and only 21 to 22 on the highway.

The Eos boasts a fun, revvy engine that won’t bore you behind the wheel. With ample room for four in a nicely appointed cabin, Volkswagen recommends the Eos for weekend trips for the whole family. In reality, the Eos would struggle to fit four suitcases with the top down (it stores in the trunk, taking up a considerable amount of cargo space) but with small suitcases and some ingenuity anything is possible. The Eos is the only hardtop convertible with a full-size retractable sunroof. The interior comes in four colors, including Red and Atlantic Blue for drivers with quirky taste. The Eos is a bit pricey compared to other Volkswagens, but with its unique array of features and surprising versatility, the Eos is a purchase you won’t regret.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 9","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong> <br />\n1.

The 2013 Patriot is the most fuel-efficient model yet, with a five-speed manual that can reach 30 miles per gallon on the highway. In 2012, improvements to the interior finally made the Patriot competitive in its class, and it even boasts Jeep’s Trail Rated badge. (Don’t take it on the Rubicon, though; the Patriot is still no Wrangler.) The upside of some lackluster components is that the Patriot is by far Jeep’s cheapest option; with a base price of $15,995 it is kind to even the sparsest pocketbooks. The upgraded interior includes deluxe cloth seats, a sound system with MP3 support and an audio jack, and optional Uconnect that can act as a mobile WiFi hotspot for up to eight devices. Like the Compass and the Liberty, the Patriot will be replaced by a new Fiat-based model by 2013 or 2014, so if this budget Jeep is your dream car you may as well get it while the getting is good.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competitors:</strong> <br />\n1.

The front and rear exterior portions of the CC received a redesign for 2013, enhancing the aggressive front end while keeping the swept-back windshield, low rear roof, and sleek back end of the 2012 model. The CC is a good-looking car any way you slice it. The available two-tone interior with brushed metal trim looks good without looking the same as the interior of every other sedan in its category. Even better, the CC has expanded its rear seat so that five people can enjoy the sumptuous interior. Bluetooth and iPod connectivity come standard and the Executive model comes with a Dynaudio sound system.  With the Passat receiving a huge price reduction, the CC may seem a little pricey by comparison, but the CC is still a good car at a good value.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 6","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

New seats offer more support for long drives and a new soft top is easier for one person to put on and take off. The Wrangler’s V-6 engine is more than capable of powering this large car, though the Wrangler’s off-road chops can make it feel clunky on paved roads. Standard removable doors will please thrill seekers, and an optional navigation system with DVD/CD player and MP3 capability will please the more comfort-minded. The six available trim levels mean that there are plenty of options, but even the priciest Wrangler still comes in under $40,000.

Gone is the triple half-dome design; gone is the dashboard flower vase. What remains is Volkswagen’s quality and attitude. The new New Beetle takes cues from the original Beetle (the back end is very similar to late-1960s bugs) and the Volkswagen Golf, where it gets some of its mechanics. Though the Beetle isn’t quite as finely tuned as the Golf, it still provides a smooth ride. Three different models (the base Beetle, a Turbo, and a new TDI clean diesel model) all have good fuel economy, but the diesel model features a stunning 41 miles to the gallon on the highway with a manual transmission. Volkswagen has taken pains to emphasize that the look and feel of this Beetle are “more masculine” than the last model, but there’s no reason to limit by gender. With eye-catching design and bold color choices, as well as some extra cargo space compared to other four-passenger cars, this Beetle has a little something for everyone.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 8","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.

As if that wasn’t enough to recommend it, it is also an absolutely stunning automobile and has an advertised top speed of 217 miles per hour. The Aventador’s exterior styling is unlike anything else in showrooms. Immediately recognizable as a Lamborghini, the aggressive front end transitions seamlessly into an aerodynamic roof and back end. The car’s most striking features are its two jack-knife doors, which immediately announce the Aventador as an exotic car – though not without giving it a Batmobile-like air. Much of the body, including the passenger cabin, is constructed out of weight-shaving carbon fiber.  This helps the V-12 engine make the trip from 0 to 60 mph in less than three seconds.  The interior is modern to the first degree, with a digital dashboard and large, center-mounted navigation system. The cabin comes in either monotone or two-tone leather. With thirteen exterior paint colors and an Ad Personam program that allows buyers to completely personalize their cars, the Aventador gives you everything you could ask for and more.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter</strong>: 10","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"JKC Icons","caption":"","fileMasterId":42585514,"fileName":"Competitors.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42585514/Competitors.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":67},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":68}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>Competition:</strong><br />\n1.
