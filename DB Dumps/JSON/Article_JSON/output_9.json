I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Fast Women","id":1034957,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know/fast-women","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-09T07:31:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Bunim Murray Revved Up","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59921547/casting-call-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59921547,"fileName":"casting-call-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-09T07:31:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Bunim Murray Revved Up","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59921544/castingcall-header.jpg","fileMasterId":59921544,"fileName":"castingcall-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-09T07:31:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Bunim Murray Revved Up","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59921547/casting-call-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59921547,"fileName":"casting-call-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":545667,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"I love <em>Project Runway.</em> Why do I love that and a lot of other reality shows?

In this setup, the engine is only rarely connected to the wheels, when cruising at medium to high speeds, for instance. Otherwise, the car will roll along in Hybrid mode (the default mode) or EV mode. EV mode, where the Accord Hybrid runs on power from the battery alone, can last up to a couple of miles in city driving, and once the battery is depleted the car will automatically switch back to Hybrid mode, where the electric motors get a boost from the Accord Hybrid’s 141-horsepower 2.0-liter engine.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"With all its various technologies, talk of the Accord Hybrid can get a little academic.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact.

The Government Should Mandate Rearview Cameras</h3>\n<h4>Laura Sky Brown, Executive Editor (That's me on the left)</h4>\nHave you used a rearview camera yet? They're becoming more common, and having used several in test cars, I now resent any vehicle I get into that doesn't have one. They're definitely on the list of things, like the iPhone and Vitamin Water Zero, that I never knew I needed but, having tried them, can no longer live without. The camera shows an image on your dashboard monitor (or sometimes your rearview mirror) of what's behind the car. The best part is the set of helpful lines that go from green to yellow to red as you get closer to that pole or curb behind you.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Just this morning, in fact, I climbed into a Dodge Avenger and put it in reverse, without the help of a rearview image. I was backing out of a diagonal parking space and had already clearly seen that the coast was clear and there was no chance anyone was anywhere nearby to walk behind me. Still, I just felt at a disadvantage, without a rearview camera in place, using the traditional mirrors and turning my head to the back. Those cameras show you the full picture of what’s behind you, and I don’t feel as good about doing without them now that the technology exists, even though I do know how to back up without one.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Government-mandated safety standards are undoubtedly controversial.

The Government Should Not Mandate Rearview Cameras, and Here's Why Not</h3>\n<h4>Molly Jean, Senior Editor (That's me on the right)</h4>\n \nI am a believer in choice. I agree with everything Laura says about the rearview camera, but I think it should be up to car buyers to decide whether or not they want to purchase it. When will the nanny state stop? A navigation system could also be considered a safety product by helping to keep the driver’s eyes on the road. Should the government mandate a navigation system in every car?\n \nI think the safest backup method is to walk around your car before slipping into the driver’s seat, and then to actually swivel around to view what is behind you as you slowly back up. I also know that some individuals, such as some older people, have a difficult time turning to look behind them and could really benefit from a rearview camera. But I still believe the individual should make the decision on whether one is needed.\n \nI have been lucky enough to drive many cars that are equipped with a rearview camera, and in fact the car I own has one. But it was not one of my requirements, like the heated seats were. Because I have been driving for over twenty years, it is not second nature for me to use the screen as I back up, so I rarely even remember I have one.

It's true that the amount of time that drivers spend backing up is minuscule compared with how much time they spend driving forward, yet a high number of collisions happen while reversing. The Smith System advocates for always backing into parking spots and grabbing pull-through spots whenever possible. Basically, the idea is to eliminate those blind-backup times altogether.<br>     \n <br>\nThe bottom line is that a driver needs to be alert at all times, and especially while reversing.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Lunacy","id":1034778,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-lunacy","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"about","id":1035130,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean/about","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-14T18:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Mercedes Benz S550","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60084555/Mercedes-Flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":60084555,"fileName":"Mercedes-Flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":648}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-14T18:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Mercedes Benz S550","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60084558/Mercedes-Header.jpg","fileMasterId":60084558,"fileName":"Mercedes-Header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":624}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-14T18:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Mercedes Benz S550","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60084555/Mercedes-Flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":60084555,"fileName":"Mercedes-Flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":648}}},"pages":[{"id":546349,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"On Wednesday and Thursday of last week, I drove a Porsche Cayman S, and then I drove twenty-six other cars.

Doing so will build your confidence and your skills and will also save you money that's easily recouped by selling that bike when you've reached your six-month milestone.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-18T04:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford_escape_homepage_copy","title":"ford escape","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60306510/ford-escape-homepage-copy.jpg","fileMasterId":60306510,"fileName":"ford-escape-homepage-copy.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-18T04:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford_escape_header_copy","title":"ford escape","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60306504/ford-escape-header-copy.jpg","fileMasterId":60306504,"fileName":"ford-escape-header-copy.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-18T04:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford_escape_homepage_copy","title":"ford escape","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60306510/ford-escape-homepage-copy.jpg","fileMasterId":60306510,"fileName":"ford-escape-homepage-copy.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":546881,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Price:</strong> $30,425 as tested (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 1.6-liter four-cylinder, 178 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 23 mpg city/26 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> MyFord Sync voice-activated system<br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without: </strong>Power liftgate($495)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Chevrolet Equinox, Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5, Toyota RAV4<br>\n<br>\nSee more specs on the Ford Escape lineup in our <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/ford/escape/\" target=\"_blank\">Car Guide.</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"ford escape","caption":"","fileMasterId":58998106,"fileName":"ford_escape_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/58998106/ford_escape_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":1,"text":"<h3>What I Think:</h3>\nWhen my high school besties decided to take a whirlwind trip to the Lake Michigan town of Saugatuck earlier this month, I took the opportunity to get some seat time in the 2014 Ford Escape.

If the choice is which compact sport-utility vehicle, the Escape is a great choice. It is a winner for driving experience, good fuel economy, and adequate cargo space.

I liked three things about it before even turning the key: the low, comfortable entry into the front seats; the low, friendly lift-over height in the back luggage compartment; and the auto-opening liftgate operated by pressing the key fob control twice. I didn't enjoy the driving experience, though. It's smaller and lower than the Explorer but still more bouncy-jouncy than I like. Having said that, I know lots of people do enjoy this kind of vehicle; I'm just not one of them. Would I get one of these for a college kid?

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-18T07:50:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"weekly_homepage","title":"the weekly windup 10 18 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59001193/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59001193,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-18T07:50:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"weekly_header","title":"the weekly windup 10 18 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59001190/weekly-header.jpg","fileMasterId":59001190,"fileName":"weekly-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-18T07:50:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"weekly_homepage","title":"the weekly windup 10 18 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59001193/weekly-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":59001193,"fileName":"weekly-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":546882,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Here are a few things we ran across on the way to finding what we were looking for.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

If he were still working out of Malibu, TV’s Jim Rockford might have driven this instead of the Pontiac Firebird he used to park outside the trailer.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her.

Rural roads, despite their low traffic and lower posted speed limits, are also measurably more dangerous than highways. <br>\n<br>\n\n<h4>Rural Roads Are 2.5 Times More Dangerous, Actually</h4>\nThat same year, data from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration reported that the fatality rate in rural areas was 2.5 times higher than the fatality rate in urban areas, regardless of road type.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-31T11:23:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"unknown-2","title":"Detroit Slow Roll","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56231507/Unknown-2.png","fileMasterId":56231507,"fileName":"Unknown-2.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-31T11:23:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"unknown","title":"Detroit Slow Roll","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56231420/Unknown.png","fileMasterId":56231420,"fileName":"Unknown.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-31T11:23:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"unknown-2","title":"Detroit Slow Roll","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56231507/Unknown-2.png","fileMasterId":56231507,"fileName":"Unknown-2.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":571468,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"slow roll detroit","caption":"","fileMasterId":56180405,"fileName":"slowroll_07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/56180405/slowroll_07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"Detroit has earned the distinction of being the most dangerous city in the United States for the past five years in a row,  according to <em>Forbes</em> magazine.

It is indeed a slow roll, and since Detroit is quite flat, any bike will do, and pretty much anyone can keep up with the group.<br>     \n<br>\n \nThe information on their website is pretty slim, so basically all we knew was to meet at Saint Andrew's Hall at 6:30 p.m. This time, rollers were encouraged to dress up for Halloween, since it was Oct 28. Saint Andrew's Hall is now exclusively a music venue, but it was once home to the Saint Andrew’s Society of Detroit with the mission to provide assistance to fellow Scots and to encourage the love of Scotland through its history, customs, music, literature, and national games. Who knew that the Scottish population is so large in Detroit that they have been organized since 1849? Underneath Saint Andrew's Hall is The Shelter, which also hosts live music. It is credited with being one of Eminem’s first venues. And looks it.<br>\n<br>\nTom was more worried about lights on our bikes than whether he should dress up as a superhero or a gangster. I ran around town buying enough gadgets and gizmos galore to make us visible to our Canadian neighbors on the other side of the river in Windsor.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-01T08:06:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup_header_real2","title":"weekly windup 11 1","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60701881/windup-header-real2.jpg","fileMasterId":60701881,"fileName":"windup-header-real2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-01T08:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup_nov1_header","title":"weekly windup 11 1","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60703735/windup-nov1-header.jpg","fileMasterId":60703735,"fileName":"windup-nov1-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-01T08:06:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup_header_real2","title":"weekly windup 11 1","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60701881/windup-header-real2.jpg","fileMasterId":60701881,"fileName":"windup-header-real2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":571473,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Here's this week's blend of crazy art, brilliant marketing, questionable ideas, and fun things to click on.

I have previously appeared as a lifeguard, a mailroom lackey, a part-time nanny, and a fudge chef, but the real reason I'm here today is because someone once told me I could write and I believed them. As a writer and publisher for BU’s online magazine, I wrote about politics and current events and wrote two series: Foxy Congressperson of the Week, which is exactly what it sounds like, and An American in Paris, detailing my misadventures abroad. \n\nGrowing up in Southeastern Michigan means that love of cars is practically a birthright, and one I’ve always been proud of. I still drive my first car, a beloved orange Chevy HHR that has been through the war and keeps on chugging. After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Alt Fuel","id":1034784,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/car-alt-fuel","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-28T11:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"diesel_homepage3","title":"i heart tdi diesel","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55911599/diesel-homepage3.jpg","fileMasterId":55911599,"fileName":"diesel-homepage3.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-28T11:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"diesel_header","title":"i heart tdi diesel","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55911587/diesel-header.jpg","fileMasterId":55911587,"fileName":"diesel-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-10-28T11:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"diesel_homepage3","title":"i heart tdi diesel","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55911599/diesel-homepage3.jpg","fileMasterId":55911599,"fileName":"diesel-homepage3.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":570949,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"It’s not exactly a secret that we’re pro-diesel here at Jean Knows Cars.

Previously, only the Q7 and A8 were available as diesel models. We had the pleasure of welcoming a 2014 Audi A7 TDI and Q5 TDI to our offices in the past few weeks, and we found that, in the case of these two, luxury and diesel go together like oysters and champagne. Audi’s TDIs command a premium over gasoline-powered versions of the same car, but they also earn significantly better mpg ratings. Our A7 TDI with its 3.0-liter, 240-hp V-6 engine is rated at 38 mpg on the highway. An A7 with the 3.0-liter, 310-hp supercharged gasoline-powered engine is rated at just 28 mpg highway. The Q5 TDI ekes 31 highway mpg out of the same 3.0-liter diesel engine; that's 5 mpg more than a Q5 with a 3.0-liter gasoline engine.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"With an as-tested price of $81,395, it’s safe to say that few of the people who buy an A7 TDI are interested in the money they will save on fuel. The more modest (but similarly equipped) Q5 TDI we tested still commanded a $55,445 asking price, and even a Q5 TDI with no options costs upward of $10,000 more than the base-model Q5. Both vehicles came standard with sumptuous black leather interiors and the Audi MMI infotainment system, and both sported the optional S line exterior styling. The turbo-diesel engine pumps out a smallish 240 horsepower, but with an impressive 428 pound-feet of torque you won’t lose many stoplight races.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Spending time behind the wheel of either of these cars is enough to turn you into a diesel convert. The all-black leather interior is as sleek and stylish as the cars’ modern exteriors and should impress even the most jaded passengers. Audi’s MMI infotainment system is simple and intuitive to use. Both cars are plenty powerful and capable, and when you’re driving them they feel exactly right: comfortable, responsive, attractive, engaging. They also have the advantage of conferring a certain status upon the driver. They say: “This person can spend twice the average annual salary on their automobile.” It’s the kind of thing we all hope our cars might say about us one day, although most of us will never be able to afford it.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"i heart tdi diesel","caption":"","fileMasterId":55911572,"fileName":"diesel_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/55911572/diesel_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":396},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":6,"text":"<strong>That’s perhaps the biggest problem with Audi’s TDIs:</strong> it takes serious mental gymnastics to convince yourself that they’re worth the multi-thousand-dollar premium. The EPA estimates that the A7 TDI will save drivers $1,500 in fuel over five years, compared with the average new vehicle, while owners of a Q5 TDI will save $750.  If buyers are contemplating one of Audi’s TDIs instead of something significantly more affordable, they’ll probably get tired of the car before they realize much fuel savings, making their TDI purchase essentially a very expensive way to achieve longer range between fill-ups.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<strong>But that all changes if you are planning to buy an Audi anyway.</strong> The gasoline-powered A7 is significantly less fuel-efficient than the average new vehicle, causing drivers to spend $2,250 more in fuel over a five-year period than the TDI version, which is right at the average mark. The same goes for the Q5. The gasoline-powered 3.0-liter V-6 version will cost you $2,250 more than the average in fuel over five years; the TDI will save you $750 off the average cost over five years.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"At the end of the day, it’s unlikely that drivers of the A7 TDI or Q5 TDI will choose their car because it makes financial sense.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I got that it was groundbreaking, but I didn't realize how soon I actually <em>would</em> have a family of six and be glad minivans had been invented.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-08T10:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup_nov8_homepage2","title":"weekly windup 11 8","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57021023/windup-nov8-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":57021023,"fileName":"windup-nov8-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-08T10:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup_nov8_header2","title":"weekly windup 11 8","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57021020/windup-nov8-header2.jpg","fileMasterId":57021020,"fileName":"windup-nov8-header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-08T10:24:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup_nov8_homepage2","title":"weekly windup 11 8","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57021023/windup-nov8-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":57021023,"fileName":"windup-nov8-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":589077,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>1. </strong>Have you ever noticed <a href=\"http://www.gerdludwig.com/recent-work/sleeping-cars/#id=album-60&num=content-786\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">how beautiful your car is</a> when it is sleeping?","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>2. </strong>Do you remember building dioramas in middle school?

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-08T09:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cass_homepage","title":"challenger to cass corridor","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57015173/cass-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":57015173,"fileName":"cass-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-08T09:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cass_header","title":"challenger to cass corridor","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62873283/cass-header.jpg","fileMasterId":62873283,"fileName":"cass-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-08T09:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cass_homepage","title":"challenger to cass corridor","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57015173/cass-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":57015173,"fileName":"cass-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":590379,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"This is a story of two rebirths: Detroit's, still in progress, and the Dodge Challenger's.

In the worst years, we would drive through the desolate neighborhood and only Mario’s would be gleaming in the night. We would pull up and hand our keys to the valet and get inside as quickly as possible. It felt dangerous. At the end of the night, when you got back on the highway, there would be a wave of relief. Businesses such as Mario’s, the Traffic Jam and Snug restaurant, and the historic Temple Bar still held on through the darkest days.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"http www lifeedited com live life just in time","caption":"","fileMasterId":62864559,"fileName":"cass_20.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62864559/cass_20.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":6,"text":"<h3>Avalon Bread</h3>\nIn 1997, <a href=\"http://www.avalonbreads.net/welcome/\" rel=\"nofollow\" \"target=\"_blank\">Avalon International Breads</a> opened in the heart of the Cass Corridor.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

One reason the Beta program was concentrated among small-town dealerships around southeastern Michigan is likely that so many Michiganders are linked in some way to the auto industry.  “I think they did that on purpose,” Kudner agreed. “With the new cars in our market, we do 98 percent of our sales as formula priced with GM, either employee or supplier or credit union discounts. It’s a set price from the factory, and people know that. It’s kind of a unique market. “<br>\n <br>\nThe dealership has recently rolled out online shopping to its used-car department, Kudner said. “Of course there’s always negotiation on them.\" A quick visit to the Used inventory on the Art Moehn website shows that you can get a lot of information, including Internet pricing, accessory discounts, financing applications, and trade-in estimates, by moving through the site.

I have known dozens of people who swear by these hardy perennials and wouldn’t dream of driving anything else.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2013 subaru impreza 2 0i premium","caption":"","fileMasterId":61593934,"fileName":"subaru-impreza-06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61593934/subaru-impreza-06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":2,"text":"Timeless was indeed the first thing I thought of when stepping inside this 2013 Impreza 2.0i in Premium trim. “Timeless” as in, time has stood still.

Where other small sedans in the Impreza’s class are making great strides in modernizing and adding technology, this car is holding fast to the good old days.

What Jean called a sewing-machine-like sound (below) was not at all like a \"normal\" inline four-cylinder engine sounds like, let me put it that way. On the other hand, get the Impreza onto the highway, and it’s surprisingly peppy and able for a four-cylinder engine that makes 148 horsepower. It took only a few drives until I was used to its eccentric sound quality and could tune it out to appreciate how sturdy and no-nonsense the Impreza really is.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"I didn’t tune out the price, though: who else makes an all-wheel-drive sedan that goes out the door for under $23,000—one that gets 33 mpg on the highway?

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding.

After all, 30 percent of Sonic buyers are under age thirty-five and will actually know how to use this connectivity tech. But the Sonic is not just about music and cuteness: it’s the first car in the subcompact class to get the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s five-star overall score for safety, and the 2013 model was also an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick.

It makes a pretty frisky 138 horsepower and comes with a choice of six-speed manual or automatic transmission.

Chevy calls this a “motorcycle-inspired exterior,” I guess because of the round headlamps. For those looking for a sporty Sonic, get the RS.

It launched last year but this year Ford has improved aerodynamics and gear shifting for even better fuel economy than last year. Ford was already claiming 7 mpg better economy than the Toyota Prius v’s highway numbers. The C-Max’s lithium-ion battery recharges while you drive using gasoline and regenerative braking recaptures up to 95 percent of the energy used in braking and uses that to recharge the battery. That’s some nifty energy recycling. The C-Max is not only efficient; it reminds you of how socially conscious you are by displaying more leaves and vines in the Smartgauge display as a “visual reward” for your good, as in energy efficient, driving, thereby making a game out of your urge to conserve. The C-Max’s popular price, starting just over $25,000—lower than its closest rival, the Toyota Prius, and some $10,000 cheaper than the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf—will help you conserve that other important green stuff in your wallet as well, always a plus.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h4>Competitors:</h4>\n1.

Just as sexy is the way it opens the rear liftgate for you if you kick your feet under it. Add to that a Class II towing package, and your sexy car will haul 3,500 pounds. Once inside, you can turn on the heated seats, check the cockpit-inspired dash, change the lighting to suit your mood, hit the push button to start, and connect to your tunes and friends through MyFord Touch. This car is loaded with tech toys. In fact, if your own driving isn’t world-class, the Escape will lend a hand. The optional BLIS system will keep an eye on the blind spot and alert you of what’s coming up alongside. The active park assist will take over the parallel parking—and execute it with the accuracy of a machine—so you can park like a pro. Oh, and with up to 32 mpg highway with the EcoBoost engine, you will have more money to spend on your own sexy self. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"\r\n<h4>Competitors:</h4>\r\n1.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-18T06:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"flipper","title":"Mercedes Benz CLA250","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61818871/Flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":61818871,"fileName":"Flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":648}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-18T06:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"header","title":"Mercedes Benz CLA250","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61818868/HEADER.jpg","fileMasterId":61818868,"fileName":"HEADER.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-18T06:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"flipper","title":"Mercedes Benz CLA250","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61818871/Flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":61818871,"fileName":"Flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":648}}},"pages":[{"id":591197,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>Vital Stats</h3>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $30,825 (includes destination)<br>\n<strong>This car’s price:</strong> $43,245 (includes destination)<br>\n<strong>EPA fuel economy:</strong> 26 mpg city/38 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, 208 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Seven-speed automatic with shift paddles<br>\n<strong>Safety features:</strong> Collision Prevention Assist (anticipates a crash and initiates braking), Attention Assist (checks steering and detects drowsiness, issuing an alarm), eight airbags, rearview camera, stability control, traction control; Driver Assistance package ($2,500) includes blind spot assist, Distronic Plus brake assist, lane keeping assist; rear-seat side airbags are optional<br>\n<strong>Tech features:</strong> Eco Start-Stop, Bluetooth, mbrace2 telematics, bi-xenon headlights<br>\n<strong>Chief competitors:</strong> Acura ILX, Audi A3, BMW 1 Series, Volkswagen CC<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/PQOOPmeOrgw?list=UUKWoLlV8-sE8zQnoWHI9qoA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Mercedes Benz CLA250","caption":"","fileMasterId":61818856,"fileName":"MB-Interior.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61818856/MB-Interior.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":2,"text":"<h3>Key Points</h3>\n•  This all-new entry-level car for Mercedes-Benz slots below the C-Class.

Sadly for those of us with a passion for offbeat cars, this vehicle is still an early concept, so don’t expect to see it on the road anytime soon.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"four electric cars","caption":"","fileMasterId":61824271,"fileName":"toyota-fcv.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61824271/toyota-fcv.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":4,"text":"<h3>Toyota FCV</h3>\nLike the BladeGlider, Toyota’s upcoming fuel cell car is on display at the Tokyo Motor Show, and like the BladeGlider, it doesn’t have a firm release date.

What it does have, though, is a fuel cell drivetrain that uses a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen that creates electricity, which in turn powers the car’s electric motor. Unlike the electric cars we see on the streets today, which need hours of charging to replenish a depleted battery, fuel cell vehicles can be refueled using hydrogen gas, at a pump much like the one you’re used to using for your gasoline-powered car. The Toyota FCV will be based on the Lexus HS, a dedicated hybrid nameplate that’s sold in Japan, and if all goes according to plan you could see them for sale in select U.S. markets by the end of 2014.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"We’ve still got a long way to go before EVs are as common as SUVs on American roadways, but if you’re hoping that day comes sooner rather than later, you should take heart in these grand plans from major automakers.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-22T07:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"la-wrap-homepage","title":"Id 451155 l a show wrapup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62048617/la-wrap-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62048617,"fileName":"la-wrap-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-22T07:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"la-wrap-header","title":"Id 451155 l a show wrapup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62048614/la-wrap-header.jpg","fileMasterId":62048614,"fileName":"la-wrap-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-22T07:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"la-wrap-homepage","title":"Id 451155 l a show wrapup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62048617/la-wrap-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62048617,"fileName":"la-wrap-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":591856,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The Los Angeles Auto Show’s press days have drawn to a close, and automakers and spokesmodels are preparing themselves for the onslaught of public attendees who will flock to the show’s public days to see everything from the redone 2014 Honda Civic (above) to the most out-there concepts.

Now Audi’s getting in on the compact luxury game with the all-new 2015 A3, which will also start at, you guessed it, $29,900 before destination. The new A3 will also be available in a performance S3 variant, as a plug-in hybrid dubbed the A3 e-tron, and as a cabriolet. (See the photo gallery below.) The new model was unveiled this week in L.A., and it looks like it will give the CLA stiff competition. Among the enticing available features are Audi’s MMI system, leather seating surfaces, and the first in-car availability of 4G LTE connectivity with the new Audi connect system.

The Colorado, for instance, makes use of the Silverado’s triple-sealed doors for improved aerodynamics and a quieter cabin.

Ford debuted its Edge Concept at this show, and although the car didn’t have any earth-shattering design changes, it did feature a host of safety and connectivity technologies that Ford plans to bring to its cars in coming years. The Edge Concept has a self-parking feature that allows drivers to park it using a remote control device, new technology that makes steering at low speeds much easier, adaptive cruise control, and a lane-keeping assist system.

It’s got a more aggressive front fascia, nineteen-inch wheels fitted with performance tires, Brembo brakes, and performance suspension parts.

The Sentra Nismo Concept has traditional Nismo styling cues like red doorsill accents, Recaro front seats, a leather-and-Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel, and a rear spoiler.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-22T08:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup-nov22-homepage","title":"weekly windup 11 22","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57542810/windup-nov22-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":57542810,"fileName":"windup-nov22-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-22T08:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup-nov22-header","title":"weekly windup 11 22","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57542807/windup-nov22-header.jpg","fileMasterId":57542807,"fileName":"windup-nov22-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":573}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-22T08:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup-nov22-homepage","title":"weekly windup 11 22","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57542810/windup-nov22-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":57542810,"fileName":"windup-nov22-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":591853,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>1.</strong> Famous <a href=\"http://hiconsumption.com/2013/10/famous-movie-cars-by-nicolas-bannister/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">movie cars</a> reimagined.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Just a few random items, all related to cars in some way, that you will want to have a look at.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>.

They suggest leaving children in forward-facing restraints until they reach the height or weight limit for the seat. When you do decide to switch to a booster seat, check that the seat fits not just your child, but also your vehicle (and any other vehicle your kid frequently rides in) before purchasing it. Also be sure to keep an eye on the IIHS’s ratings. Three seats that had passed previous tests with flying colors slipped to a Check Fit rating this year after they were substantially redesigned; don’t assume that a seat is safe just because it earned a good rating a few years ago.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>...And Then, Don't Rush Out of One</h3>\nOnce you find the right booster seat for your child, fight to keep him or her in it. As little kids turn into big kids, they may start rebelling against the oppression and fundamental un-coolness of a car seat.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-26T10:28:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"turkeyday-homepage","title":"thanksgiving playlist","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57638399/turkeyday-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":57638399,"fileName":"turkeyday-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-26T10:28:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"turkeyday-header","title":"thanksgiving playlist","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57638396/turkeyday-header.jpg","fileMasterId":57638396,"fileName":"turkeyday-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-26T10:28:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"turkeyday-homepage","title":"thanksgiving playlist","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/57638399/turkeyday-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":57638399,"fileName":"turkeyday-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":592042,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"It is the season of traveling, perhaps just across town, but still we will all spend a little seat time this week.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Fast Women","id":1034957,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/fast-women","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-26T09:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-homepage","title":"rosie the riveter reunion","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63783612/rosie-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63783612,"fileName":"rosie-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-26T09:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-header","title":"rosie the riveter reunion","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63783609/rosie-header.jpg","fileMasterId":63783609,"fileName":"rosie-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-26T09:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"rosie-homepage","title":"rosie the riveter reunion","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63783612/rosie-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63783612,"fileName":"rosie-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":592030,"metaDescription":"300-word story with photos -- Rosie the Riveter group getting together socially and talking about their lives since working at Willow Run during World War II","metaKeywords":["fast-women"],"metaTitle":"Rosie the Riveter Reunion","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Military Appreciation Night at the USA Hockey game: this was not going to be a typical game.

Frances Masters, Lela Talbott Detrich, Ruth Webb, and Rachel Mae Perry spent their days “poppin’ rivets” at Willow Run, and Vivian Litchard (center in this photo) worked in the sewing department. Three were local girls; the others moved to the area for the work. Mrs. Perry (right), the daughter of sharecroppers and eldest of eight, came from Kentucky. Her paychecks went home for support. Mrs. Webb (left) said her whole family moved to the area from rural Indiana. She remembers the journey vividly: all twenty family members, including two babies, on the back of a flatbed truck. Her father refused to stop, so the only way to provide for the babes was to milk the goat they had in tow.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Through the individual stories, general themes emerged.

The male employees fell into two groups: “4-Fs,” ineligible for service for physical reasons (and, it seems, ineligible for dating), and supervisors, men beyond draftable age. Mrs. Litchard, who at eighty-eight is still striking, recalls her boss, twelve years her senior, asking her to dinner, but he didn’t want to pick her up in front of the other girls in the village—to \"avoid appearances of favoritism.\"  She later met his wife.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-28T18:07:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"black-friday-homepage","title":"black friday windup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63902175/black-friday-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63902175,"fileName":"black-friday-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-28T18:07:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"black-friday-header","title":"black friday windup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63902172/black-friday-header.jpg","fileMasterId":63902172,"fileName":"black-friday-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-28T18:07:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"black-friday-homepage","title":"black friday windup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63902175/black-friday-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63902175,"fileName":"black-friday-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":592117,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"black friday windup","caption":"","fileMasterId":63902193,"fileName":"farmers.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63902193/farmers.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"<h3> The Farmer in All of Us: An American Portrait ($45)</h3>\nYesterday was a day to be thankful, and I am personally thankful for all the farmers who grow our food.

Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun.

Around 2011, that all changed, and we are now told that age two is much safer for children. But Volvo is no latecomer to the rear-facing mandate: It made its first rear-facing child seat concept in 1967. The reason? Because children's heads are heavy relative to their young bodies, and their necks and vertebrae are not fully developed, so they can be injured more easily when facing forward in the event of a crash.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"Fun facts: Volvo thinks <em>everyone</em> riding in a car would be safer if they faced backward.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

So why are automakers still struggling to effectively target this huge buying audience? Tinesha Craig, director of the i on Women division of the market research firm Insights in Marketing, took a look at how women view the car buying process. She found that only 26 percent of women said they were \"extremely satisfied\"  with the options available to them in the automotive market.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Craig surveyed women about their habits and experiences in shopping for cars to try to figure out what needs to change. What she learned was that—perhaps unsurprisingly—women aren’t all that different from men when it comes to shopping for cars. But there are a few places where we differ. “In terms of motivators and thought process, [men and women] are fairly similar,” Craig said in a phone interview. But women are more likely to start their shopping process online, and have a greater desire to feel informed before we ever set foot in a dealership. Here are five things that are important to women buyers. Automakers, are you listening?","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>1. We Want Clarity on the Web</h3>\nThere's a lot of information available on automakers' websites now. Unfortunately, many automakers have websites that aren’t fully responsive to the needs of a variety of shoppers. Websites often fail to clearly demonstrate a car’s full range of features, tending to focus in on its performance attributes instead. “Some women may be interested in performance, some want to know about safety features. It’s important to understand the range,” Craig explained. She said many shoppers would benefit from a full, jargon-free rundown of a car’s features and how it compares to the competition.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"We want to know how long cars will last, how reliable they’ll be, and what kind of warranty the manufacturer offers. It should be easier to make head-to-head comparisons.","type":"blockquote"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>2. We Want to See Warranty and Resale Information</h3>\nWomen also buy new cars less frequently than their male counterparts, meaning they hold on to cars for longer. This means we want to know how long our cars will last, how reliable they’ll be, and what kind of warranty the manufacturer offers. “The warranty piece, I think, is a mystery to everybody,” said Craig. While some automakers tout their warranties and resale values, others aren’t as clear. It should be easier to make head-to-head comparisons and find the details on the model you are looking at.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>3. We Expect a Little Respect at the Dealership</h3>\nWhile we’re waiting for car companies to wise up to the things they could do to cater to women in the shopping process, is there anything women can do to streamline the process ourselves? Craig acknowledged that for many women, a trip to the dealership can be a stressful experience. “Going to the dealer feels like being in a pressure cooker. The focus is on [the dealer], not what the customer wants.” This could be why so many women start their search online in hopes of avoiding an unpleasant experience at the dealership. Craig said she has walked away from a dealership that gave her “that slimy, icky feeling,” opting instead for one that treated her with respect and gave her plenty of time to test drive the car she was interested in.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>4. We Listen to Our Friends</h3>\nCraig said that in her own car buying process, she has relied on advice from trusted friends instead. That’s not uncommon: 63 percent of the women she surveyed also looked to friends for car advice. Dealers should be leveraging the socially interactive female customer by asking them to refer friends and inviting them to bring friends along on the buying process.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>5. We Want Car Buying to Be Fun</h3>\nIf you’re dreading a trip to the dealer, don't. You have the purchasing power to make it a good experience. Starting your search online could be a good way to get some basic information about the cars you’re interested in. The test drive is still a crucial step, so don’t put up with a dealer who won’t give you the time you need. Find one who will help you feel good about the process of buying a car, and be sure you're comfortable with your purchase before you sign on the dotted line. Craig lamented that car buying has become such a chore for some women. “There’s a lot of frustration with this process, but there doesn’t need to be. It should be exciting.”<br>\n<br>\n<em>Images from Jupiterimages/liquidlibrary/ThinkStock</em>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h3>Related stories:</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/getting-in-comfort-zone/\" target=\"_blank\">Get into a Car-Buying Comfort Zone</a> August 8, 2013<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/three-reality-checks/\" target=\"_blank\">Buying a Car?

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.
