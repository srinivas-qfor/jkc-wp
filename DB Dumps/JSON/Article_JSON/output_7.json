I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

On an 80-degree day, the cabin of a car can reach 100 degrees in the time it takes to pick up a package of diaper wipes at your local convenience store. The fact is that a child’s body can heat up five times faster than an adult’s. In other words, a child can die from heat stroke on a 72-degree day.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"This kind of technology has been looked at before.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Driving Tips","id":1034956,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-driving-tips","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"All Videos","id":1023756,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1023763,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos/qa","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-28T09:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lda--homepage","title":"favorites","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63967750/LDA--homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63967750,"fileName":"LDA--homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-28T09:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lda-header","title":"favorites","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63967753/LDA-header.jpg","fileMasterId":63967753,"fileName":"LDA-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-28T09:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lda--homepage","title":"favorites","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63967750/LDA--homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63967750,"fileName":"LDA--homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":464344,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"the no 1 ladies driving academy reverse","caption":"","fileMasterId":46711391,"fileName":"rose1.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46711391/rose1.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":0,"text":"This is the second video in a series, in which I spend some quality time behind the wheel with Elle and Rose, two teenage girls in the process of getting their driver's licenses.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Soapbox","id":1034787,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/soapbox","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-10T12:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"auto racing 101","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52856865/Racing-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":52856865,"fileName":"Racing-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-10T12:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"auto racing 101","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52856856/Racing-header.jpg","fileMasterId":52856856,"fileName":"Racing-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":305},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":542}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-10T12:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"auto racing 101","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52856859/Racing-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":52856859,"fileName":"Racing-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":464393,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Auto racing is a fabulous spectacle, whether seen in person or on TV.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Mercedes-Benz had never intended to build a production Gullwing. But Max Hoffman, the man responsible for bringing the greatest European marques to America in the 1950s, was enthralled by the 300SL that won the 1952 Carrera Panamericana.

An aluminum intake manifold sprouted ram pipes to each of the cylinders, the brake drums were steel-lined aluminum, vacuum-boosted, and finned for cooling, and the chassis was a tube frame.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-09T13:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"fiat lust part three test drives","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46786790/fiat3-promoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":46786790,"fileName":"fiat3-promoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-09T13:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"fiat lust part three test drives","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46786721/fiat3-header.jpg","fileMasterId":46786721,"fileName":"fiat3-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2212},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":3931}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-09T13:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"fiat lust part three test drives","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46786715/fiat-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":46786715,"fileName":"fiat-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":463955,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"fiat lust part three test drives","caption":"","fileMasterId":46786763,"fileName":"fiat_06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46786763/fiat_06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":0,"text":"<em>My story began in the winter (<a href=http://www.jeanknowscars.com/features/style/fiat-lust/ target=\"_blank\">Part One</a>), when I first started considering whether I could justify replacing my Honda Odyssey with a Fiat 500.

I was in that efficient maternal mode, prone to frustration, as I was trying to squeeze in three test drives while the children were at play rehearsal. Moreover, I was a touch resentful that I was spending the first sunny Saturday in weeks car shopping. Mother Nature seemed to be telling me: “You know you want the Fiat. Don’t waste your time with other vehicles.” My conscience, however, was driving me to due diligence. Thus conflicted, any impediment to my efficiency was not welcome, particularly with a car that was lower on my list.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Slightly frustrated, I wandered in through a side door, down a dark hallway with offices off the corridor occupied by middle-aged men, and into what was supposed to be a showroom, yet with nary a car in sight: lots of desks and paper and clutter, but no cars.

Those populations can buy liquor starting at 7:00 a.m. on Sundays, but not cars. While the impetus for the law was founded in a particular Protestant work ethic and notion of the day of rest, the continuation of the tradition seems to stem from the dealerships’ resistance to change. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"Michigan is not the only state with such a law. That said, in the twelve other states that ban vehicle sales on Sundays, the approach to sale hours is far more sensible. Some dealerships outside Michigan stay open until 9:00 p.m. on Saturday; some are only open until 6:00. In Ann Arbor and other Michigan cities, most dealerships close at 3:00 or 4:00 on Saturdays.

How quaint and 1950s-esque. Perhaps dealerships might take notice of the new reality. I’m lucky if I’m home by 6:30. Dinner on the table before 8:00 is a rarity, which does not exactly leave time on Mondays and Thursdays to pop out for a test drive. And Saturdays? Throw in one hockey game or another typical Saturday children’s event, and it doesn’t exactly leave a large window between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. I’m not quite sure when parents are supposed to car shop in this town.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<h4>Perhaps My Gender Has Something to Do with This?</h4>\r\nHowever, I wondered if gender were coming into play at the <strong>Toyota/Scion</strong> dealership.

I felt the same at the <strong>Ford</strong> dealership earlier that afternoon. I wandered around for ten minutes without anyone speaking to me. I noticed, however, that when a couple or an older gentleman walked in, they were greeted immediately. I finally went to what seemed to be the front desk and asked, only slightly sardonically, if I had to sign in, as one does at the doctor’s office.

At the <strong>Mazda</strong> and <strong>Honda/Volkswagen/Audi</strong> dealerships, the vehicles occupy the showroom floor, and the offices are set to the back of the building. One has space, literally and figuratively, to examine the models on display, and the salesmen have the space to observe and approach an unattended customer. The <strong>Chevrolet</strong> and <strong>Fiat</strong> dealerships—both owned by the Suburban Group—took consideration of space one step further. Spatial fluidity drives the showroom arrangement. The vehicle display blends with open and inviting desk spaces. “Inviting” seems to be the mode, as both dealerships had salespeople who greeted each customer who walked in the door.

To be fair to the other dealerships in town, this space was purpose built and brand-new, having been open for only a short time. Moreover, the entire space is given over to one car and one car alone: the Fiat 500. Yet the spatial branding is so well done. Drawing from glass-box mid-twentieth-century modern design, the building has a façade of plate glass windows with ceilings twenty-five feet high. One enters a showroom in which a row of five or six Fiat 500s are neatly aligned. Sleek display cases house Fiat brand merchandise (everything from key chains to coffee mugs to polo shirts) on the back wall to the left, while the right-hand back wall contains an interactive display where one can select and watch videos of the 500 in action. The cabinets in the office area continue the modern aesthetic: mod and Fiat red with minimal hardware. The theme of sleek Italian design even carries to the restrooms, sparsely articulated with slick fixtures. Imagine an Italian auto dealership fit for <em>Dwell</em> magazine, and you have Suburban Fiat.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":18,"text":"Space alone, however, does not create an Italian ethos. Activation and associations of a space depend on the personalities and the rituals within. In every way, Suburban Fiat embodies the Italian ethos.

It dawned on me later that she was the only female salesperson I encountered at six dealerships. Tall and model thin, she sported  short, cropped hair and an elegant, flowing outfit accentuated with arresting jewelry. “Hi. Welcome to Fiat. Are you interested in the 500? Have a seat. Would you like an espresso or a water?” This is my kind of car shopping.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":19,"text":"The Kirkland brand water that she handed me, straight from Costco, as opposed to the bottle of San Pellegrino I was expecting, was the one slightly jarring reminder that I wasn’t in Italy.

Just as I was finishing, a couple returned from a test drive.

The lines are so architectural that I compared the space to driving a modern penthouse. Needless to say, the salesman was slightly puzzled by my analogy. The manual transmission shifted efficiently, and the drive had a lovely fluidity about it. What’s not to love, aside from the price, which would have topped the $20,000 limit? The seats. The seats were designed for a large man in a small car. The base was so long that my knees just made it over the edge; the side bolsters projected so that every time I shifted, the back of my arm hit them. I had a tender spot on that arm for two days after the test drive, bringing new meaning to the term <em>slug bug</em>. I asked if the car came with a pillow to place behind the backs of short women.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Five, ten, so many times I couldn’t count, and he laughed. I asked him, “What’s the most important thing to worry about: the windshield wipers or the brakes?” He said, “Both.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Fast Women","id":1034957,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/fast-women","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-22T06:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"corry weller off road truck racer","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46837996/weller-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":46837996,"fileName":"weller-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-22T06:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"corry weller off road truck racer","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/53103453/weller-Header.jpg","fileMasterId":53103453,"fileName":"weller-Header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-05-22T06:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"corry weller off road truck racer","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/53103459/weller-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":53103459,"fileName":"weller-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":465441,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"For Corry Weller, driving a truck in the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series means soaring over jumps, slamming to the ground, and sliding sideways through 180-degree turns.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

If so, you'll want to avoid the temptation to plug your kids in to an endless cycle of videos, video games, and iPod music with headphones. I'm not saying you won't ever want to resort to that; technology allows each of us to have \"alone time\" while sitting right next to each other. That's exactly why you want to limit it. Why put everybody in the car as a family and then ignore each other? Instead, bite the bullet and let your kids have control of what the group listens to for some of the time, and listen to it together. Some of my favorite drives are when my teenage son Henry acts as DJ and plays me everything from vintage Bob Dylan to weird Japanese electronic music.

Even toddlers can learn to prefer stories read aloud in the car. That's so much better than a constant stream of cartoon videos that block out the scenery they should be looking at on a trip. Having said that, you don't have to be shackled to tween pop music stations the whole time, and you do get to put on NPR or whatever you'd rather be listening to. Sharing your favorite things, and then being patient while others share theirs, is a lesson the whole family can keep on learning.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":6},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:08:28.645-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865708646 }} },{ "_id":343997,"title":"Nicko McBrain and Me","subTitle":"Check out his customized XKR-S","slug":"nicko-mcbrain-and-me","promoTitle":"Nicko McBrain and Me","promoTeaserSmall":"Check out his customized XKR-S","promoTeaser":"Iron Maiden's drummer is a salt-of-the-earth guy who sincerely loves Jaguars.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I found out about it when I longed to see my boyfriend, Ben, who'd hitchhiked from Ann Arbor with his friend PK to find J. Stevens, a mysterious Latvian friend of ours who went by the name on the shirt he'd bought secondhand at St. Vincent de Paul. J. Stevens had disappeared into the mountains somewhere above Aspen and was building an illegal shack on federal land. Ben and PK had the name of a guy who lived there who might know where J. Stevens was. So off they went, by way of Idaho and San Francisco, bar to bar to bar, in search of the elusive Latvian.<br>\n<Br>\nAfter one late-night, reversed charge phone call from the boys, I decided on a whim to go looking for all of them. I was eighteen years old. It took one ride to get from Ann Arbor to Colorado, where every campground was bulging at the seams with half naked, totally stoned, and barefoot flower children and their psychedelic school buses. Being from a tiny farm town of 5,000 people at the base of Michigan's thumb, I was overwhelmed by this rich tapestry of life. Actually, I was overwhelmed that I'd actually hitchhiked halfway across the country without being murdered and was in Aspen. Now what?<br>\n<br>\nGoing on the same single clue that the boys had, I found J. Stevens working away on a pile of ancient scrap lumber salvaged from an abandoned cabin in a small clearing, a mile straight up Little Annie on the backside of town. I set up my tent and sleeping bag and was immediately immersed in the routine of sorting scrap wood, hiking a half-mile across the mountain to fill and carry back water jugs from the stream, and hiking down the mountain to do laundry. I would hitchhike from the bottom of the hill to town, do the clothes, spend the night in a local campground with the Rainbow People, then hitch to the base of the mountain for the return hike up. On one such foray into town, I got out of a truck on the side of the highway at the exact moment Ben and PK were emerging from a truck that was dropping them off on the other side of the road! <br>\n<br>\n<strong>I'd been there a month already,</strong> so I hung out with them for another week and then decided to head for home. It took two rides. The first was from Aspen to Boulder in a Jeep with two guys in front, a German Shepherd in the back, and a box of eight-track tapes. I squeezed in with the dog. They dropped me at the top of an entrance ramp to Interstate 80 looking down over a rail yard.<br>\n<br>\nI was there for a couple of hours, in such a state of despair that I was seriously considering jumping a train. At one point, a police car raced past me to pick up a guy hitching farther down the ramp. Before I had to make a decision to run, two hippies in an old red-and-white station wagon backed all the way up the ramp and saved me. A guy and his sick girlfriend were on their way to Chicago. She was laid out in the back, so I rode up front with him and helped with the driving.<br>\n<br>\nWe drove through the night, hitting the outskirts of Chi-town at 2:00 a.m. I was nervously awaiting the moment when they would kick me to the curb with not a dime in my pocket, 200 miles from home. But we kept driving east on I-94. \"We decided back in Nebraska that we couldn't let you out in the middle of the night,\" my Good Samaritan said.<br>\n<br>\nThey took me to my door, where we together discovered that my roommates, confused by my one-month absence, had moved everything from my room, put it in the basement, and rented my room out even though I had paid the rent through the month. <br>\n<br>\nWe all slept for a few hours on the floor, they went back to Chicago, and I moved across the street. <br>\n<br>\n\nHave a great summer! <br>\nLove, Jean<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h4>Laura Sky Brown's First-Time-on-the-Road Nostalgia</h4>\nI was born just a tiny bit late to the Sixties party, meaning that at the age when any self-respecting hippie would have been hitchhiking to Woodstock or at least to San Francisco, I was a young preteen still linked firmly to family and home.

His movements as he yanked at the seatbelts caused the plane to sway in place; the loud crying of his son, who didn’t like to travel (and, thirteen years later, still doesn’t), only made things worse. And then there was the situation with my uncle’s three insulated canteens, each filled to the brim with water, and his ever-present tripod and video camera. My mom and I helped him carry them until my aunt realized that her husband had turned her older sister and niece into uncomplaining human pack animals and promptly took the gear from us. My mom and I giggled as we listened to her employing very colorful words as she told my uncle that he should have left the canteens and the tripod at home. Now, many years after that trip, the words \"tripod\" and \"hot tub\" still send my mom and me into fits of snorts and giggles.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"our favorite road trip memories","caption":"","fileMasterId":53161851,"fileName":"Christina_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/53161851/Christina_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":11,"text":"Now that I’m done with school, one of my dream trips is to actually go to Mackinac Island instead of spending years talking about it; the other is to go to England.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Buyers can receive a federal tax incentive of up to $7,500 on their new EVs, depending on the car’s battery capacity.

Most obviously, the drivers of electric cars don’t have to shell out for a fresh tank of gas every few hundred miles. Electric cars can typically be charged for as little as a few dollars, and some electric cars also have lower maintenance costs when compared to traditional cars since they have fewer moving parts and

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

The Pro Solo setup is actually two mirror-image courses run by two drivers at a time, so you have the illusion of wheel-to-wheel racing. Each driver gets three sets of runs; each set comprises two runs on both the left and right courses. Rather than trip a timer at the starting line, Pro Solo drivers do a drag-racing-style start—staging at a set of lights called a Christmas tree.

This is one of the weirder scenes I have experienced: a sea of people wandering seemingly aimlessly in a parking lot full of orange cones, the early morning mist rising from asphalt that will be brutal and bubbling by noon. People holding hands, walking dogs, pushing strollers, carrying umbrellas against the heat, as they follow the twists and turns of the course. People on their hands and knees staring intently through a cone-marked corner. People running the course on foot, weaving in and out of the pylon slalom. People on in-line roller skates and bicycles. People with video cameras taking movies of the racing line, movies they will run on fast forward in their hotel rooms, looking for a clue.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Marchell Fletcher, from Colorado (1989 Solo II ladies’ class champion), says walking isn’t enough.

Then she walks the line. Then she revises her drawing. Then she volunteers to work out there in the cone field when she’s not racing, and she watches how the fastest men take the corners.

When you race Pro Solo in the ladies’ class, your score isn’t only based on how you do, it’s based on how you do indexed against the top men in your class. The performance envelope is very narrow in, say, a stock Civic, so a top woman driver has a much better chance of being very close to a top male driver in that car. Hence her index will be most favorable. All the girls in the know <em>knew</em> I was screwed, indexwise, because the co-driver of my lovely four-wheel-drive Isuzu Impulse was Grant Byers (1986-87 Solo II champion). Byers works for Monroe, and he runs whatever car he’s using for shock development work. Unfortunately, Byers is good. I just knew I would be the victim of the index.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"I made my own graph paper and used a heavy pen to draw in the cones.

As I heard Cindy Jansen’s Chevrolet Camaro on my right roar away, I saw in horror that my light was <em>way</em> green. I was holding the Impulse’s revs at about 3,000, and I dropped the clutch.

Updates to the Malibu’s available 2.0-liter turbocharged powerplant will add fourteen percent more torque to that 259-horsepower engine.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Look for the 2014 Malibu to hit dealer showrooms this fall.\r\n","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":47364086,"fileName":"Malibu_header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47364086/Malibu_header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":47364080,"fileName":"Malibu_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47364080/Malibu_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":47364083,"fileName":"Malibu_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47364083/Malibu_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":47264458,"fileName":"Malibu_04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47264458/Malibu_04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":6,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":7753,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Malibu","year":0},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:08:34.411-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865714412 }} },{ "_id":344649,"title":"The Mille Miglia by JeanCam","subTitle":"Share my short-lived thrills on video","slug":"the-mille-miglia-by-jeancam","promoTitle":"The Mille Miglia by JeanCam","promoTeaserSmall":"My 1,000-mile race of a lifetime in a 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing ended before we got very far.","promoTeaser":"My 1,000-mile race of a lifetime in a 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing ended before we got very far.","keywords":["The Mille Miglia by JeanCam"],"metaTitle":"The Mille Miglia by JeanCam - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Mercedes-Benz","1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing","Mercedes Gullwing","Mille Miglia","Mille Miglia Storica","Italian road racing","European road racing","historic racing events","Brescia","Steve Cannon","Mercedes-Benz North America"],"metaDescription":"The Mille Miglia by JeanCam!

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-04T14:04:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"land rover art installment ny","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47294986/landrover-PromoLarge.png","fileMasterId":47294986,"fileName":"landrover-PromoLarge.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-04T14:04:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"land rover art installment ny","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47294983/landrover-header.jpg","fileMasterId":47294983,"fileName":"landrover-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-04T14:04:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"land rover art installment ny","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47295109/Landrover-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":47295109,"fileName":"Landrover-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":467115,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"New Yorkers with a love for aluminum, SUVs, and art: please report to the meatpacking district.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-11T05:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 honda civic si","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47668367/Honda-Civic-Si-PromoLarge-w.jpg","fileMasterId":47668367,"fileName":"Honda-Civic-Si-PromoLarge-w.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-11T06:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 honda civic si","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47595820/Honda-Civic-Si-header-3.jpg","fileMasterId":47595820,"fileName":"Honda-Civic-Si-header-3.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-06T11:09:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013 honda civic si","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47383237/Honda-Civic-Si-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":47383237,"fileName":"Honda-Civic-Si-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":467276,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>The Car:</h3>\n<strong>Price:</strong> $25,005 as tested (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.4-Liter DOHC 16-valve i-VTEC four-cylinder, 201 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed manual<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 22 mpg city/31 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard features:</strong> Rearview camera, Bluetooth hands-free link, USB audio interface, side curtain airbags with rollover sensor, Pandora Internet radio interface, fold-flat rear seats<br>\n<strong>Option(s) I can’t live without:</strong> XM Satellite radio (free for the first three months)","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2013 honda civic si","caption":"","fileMasterId":47383267,"fileName":"Honda_Civic_Si_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47383267/Honda_Civic_Si_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":1,"text":"<h3>What I Think:</h3>\nThe Honda Civic is well known as the kind of car that a non-car-loving person would go for.

A little less modern is the retention of a four-speed automatic transmission. For those who want a manual transmission, that one's a six-speed, though. The LE Eco model is targeting 40 mpg, although EPA numbers won’t be out for a while.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2013 Toyota Corolla S","caption":"","fileMasterId":47532425,"fileName":"2013_Toyota_Corolla_S_622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47532425/2013_Toyota_Corolla_S_622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":4,"text":"Pricing will be announced closer to the car’s launch in the fall.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

This causes your car’s front suspension to compress and makes it less able to handle uneven road surfaces.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Well, it goes like this: Renault owns Nissan, and Infiniti is part of Nissan.  The engines are from Renault, which has been in Formula 1 racing for a long, long time. Infiniti is trying to become a bigger entity in Europe, and Formula 1 racing is the number-one automotive billboard for the rest of the world outside the United States. So it makes sense that Infiniti would buy into a sponsorship of the team and Vettel to amp up its presence.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/c6G3IvGcgfM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Vettel And Mounties 622","caption":"","fileMasterId":53783511,"fileName":"Vettel_and_Mounties_622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/53783511/Vettel_and_Mounties_622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":621}},"order":5,"text":"<strong>You might wonder why they wanted to vet our interview questions.</strong> Why would they care?

Vettel then ignored team orders, passed Weber, and won the race. He later apologized, but the die was cast, and the fans have been unruly ever since. In fact, when he won in Canada, he was booed loudly by the crowd. We actually did ask him about his reception after the Canadian race.

They are rubber with large lips that look like they could hold a couple liters of liquid. The interior was also predictably smart; everything felt like it was built to be driven well over the century mark on the odometer. I expected the driving experience to be the same feeling—prudent and slightly dull. I was proven wrong on a quick trip to Target. The 2.0-liter turbocharged engine was actually fun to drive and will make me think twice about this car.<br/>\n<strong>Christina:</strong> I come from a Subaru-driving family. I love Subarus and I love the way this one drives. However, I didn’t feel comfortable behind the wheel at all. The steering wheel blocked the gauges. The color display over the touchscreen was distracting. The climate control knobs were confusing. And the ceiling? Despite the fact that I’m short, I felt my head was up too close to the headliner once I adjusted the driver’s seat so that I had a good view of the road. I'd hate to be a tall person driving this one.<br/>\n<strong>Laura:</strong> I have known lots of people who drove Subarus, since we live in a wintry, and also a hippieish, climate here in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I haven’t considered owning one myself until now, because none of my friends’ cars were this good. This Subaru is utterly practical: I love the power liftgate, the stealth storage cubbies under the cargo floor, and the rubber mats everywhere that manage to look good while they make you start thinking about owning this Forester for ten years. The best part: while you’re driving around feeling smart and capable, like the kind of person who reads <em>Consumer Reports</em> for fun, notice how much fun you are having in this car.<br/>\n<strong>Jean:</strong> I've recommended a Forester to three different people in the past month.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

(See our <a href=http://www.jeanknowscars.com/videos/car-reviews/jeans-driveway-2013-dodge-dart-rallye/viewall/ target=\"_blank\">Jean's Driveway review</a> from last fall.) Starting below $20,000, it could also be an important addition to the good-cars-for-people-on-a-budget category. The Dart I drove, the SXT MultiAir Turbo, was pushed above $20,000 by the addition of a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and a 1.4-liter four-cylinder turbocharged engine, but it still came in well under $25,000.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Those pricey options—each adds more than $1,000 to the price of the car—aren’t my favorite aspects of the Dart. The dual-clutch transmission feels slow and a little jerky, while the turbocharged engine sips expensive premium fuel and offers only modest power increases from the standard, non-turbocharged engine. Luckily, the Dart assuages some price concerns with its impressive fuel economy: 27 mpg city and 37 mpg highway. Without the engine upgrade, the Dart would still manage 25 mpg in the city and 36 mpg on the highway.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"Fuel economy isn’t the only place the Dart stands out. Its exterior styling sets it apart from its compact-sedan competition.

It makes the car feel more expensive than it is—always a good quality in an optional upgrade.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>The Verdict:</h3>\nFor what it is—a starter car with hypermiling fuel economy ratings—the Dart does very well. If I were shopping for a Dart, I would consider opting for the standard 2.0-liter Tigershark engine and manual transmission to avoid the premium-fuel requirement, but I'd keep our tester’s Uconnect system and racetrack taillights.

She describes her profession as “relationship based” and says up to 70 percent of her customers are repeat clients or are referred by satisfied customers. Since Beth also told us she’s on track to sell more than 200 new and used cars this year, we figured she knows what she is talking about.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Here are her five tips for you, if you are getting ready to walk into a dealership in pursuit of your next vehicle.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>1. Do the amount of advance research you feel comfortable with.</h4> Beth says she finds the average customer has already done eleven hours of Internet research before coming in to the dealership. “That’s the tool the Internet has given people. Do as much or as little research as you want before you come in,” she says, but understand that your salesperson is “actually there to help you. We have a fair amount of information that augments the research you’ve already done.” Having said that, she points out that she always invites her clients to confirm whatever information she gives them, if they want to. “I want my customer to feel comfortable at the end of the process.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h4>2. Get referrals from people you know and trust.</h4> “Ask your friends. Where did they buy their car, who did they buy it from, and would they go back there again? Even if you’re new in town, you know somebody you can ask: coworkers, neighbors, your dentist. If they wouldn’t go back to the same dealer, that’s a useful answer, too.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>3. Focus on getting the salesperson you want.</h4> “Eighty percent of new contacts are now e-mail initiated,” Beth explains. “A lot of times, unless you initially ask for a salesperson, you’ll get round-robined to whoever’s turn is next in the queue. Sometimes there’s a business development center in the dealership that handles e-mail queries and does initial contact until you make an appointment. At any time in there, if you have a preference—male, female, age, a used-car expert—you can specify. People are often thinking, ‘I want a blue car,’ not ‘I want a certain kind of salesperson to help me through the transaction,’ ” Beth says. Remember what stage of the transaction you're in and get that job done.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Next? “Once you get to the appointment, unless the salesperson warrants it, it’s not necessary to treat them like the enemy. You need to be willing to share with me, which means you have to trust me,” she says. But, she adds, if you find that your salesperson is not treating you well, or just isn’t going to make you feel comfortable, get up from the desk and ask for a different one. “Trust me,” Beth says, “we have thick hides.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"Not comfortable speaking up? If the relationship is not going to work, one way Beth has seen clients handle it is to end the appointment, then call the dealership from home to ask for a different salesperson. “That works!” she says.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h4>4. Understand your financial situation and be ready to consider various options.</h4> Beth remarks, “A shocking amount of what I do with people is financial planning.” Look at the salesperson as an informed resource who can help you find the best solution for your needs, she says. “Some people come in with a plan in place about how they’re going to buy the car—X money down, Y payment, Z equipment, pay off over A number of years—and sometimes I can help them see different ways of going about it that make it possible not to have to wait to have that down payment, or to pay a lower interest rate by getting a better car and saving money down the line.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<h4>5. Don't stress out and ruin the experience.</h4> “Don't be in your head 100 percent,” Beth says. In that, she is definitely on the same page with JeanKnowsCars.com. Like us, she sees that buying a new car is a treat, and you should let yourself appreciate the indulgence. “The numbers have to line up—size, fuel economy, specs—but don’t let that be the only factor. Let the salesperson help you enjoy the big purchase. Part of a purchase is emotional. If you don’t enjoy it, you’re not going to get the most out of it.” How to do that? Beth advises, “Relax, follow your instincts, and buy from someone you feel good about working with.”","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:08:42.111-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865722112 }} },{ "_id":345611,"title":"Ford's Talking Brake Light","subTitle":"Would you pay extra for one?","slug":"fords-talking-brake-light","promoTitle":"Ford's Talking Brake Light","promoTeaserSmall":"Electronic Brake Light tells other cars, even ones that can't see you yet, when you're braking.","promoTeaser":"Electronic Brake Light tells other cars, even ones that can't see you yet, when you're braking.","keywords":["Ford's Talking Brake Light"],"metaTitle":"Ford's Talking Brake Light - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Ford Electronic Brake Light","Ford brake light","car-to-car communication technology","inter-car communication","wireless car technology"],"metaDescription":"Ford's Talking Brake Light: Ford is testing a communicating brake light system that can use wireless car-to-car communication infrastructure to tell other cars when you're putting on the brakes.

For instance, did you know that more women than men are licensed to drive (a fun fact presented by the representative from Cooper Tire)?

After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-28T07:56:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 ford f150 tremor","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48633101/ford-tremor-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":48633101,"fileName":"ford-tremor-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-28T07:56:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 ford f150 tremor","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48633275/Ford-Tremor-header.jpg","fileMasterId":48633275,"fileName":"Ford-Tremor-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-28T07:56:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 ford f150 tremor","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48633104/ford-tremor-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":48633104,"fileName":"ford-tremor-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":469466,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The Ford F-150 is one of the bestselling vehicles in the United States, so any time Ford announces changes to its star pickup, it’s big news.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-28T06:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 mercedes benz e350","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48621800/mercedes-eclass-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":48621800,"fileName":"mercedes-eclass-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-28T06:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 mercedes benz e350","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48621740/mercedes-eclass-01.jpg","fileMasterId":48621740,"fileName":"mercedes-eclass-01.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-06-28T06:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 mercedes benz e350","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48621743/Mercedes-Eclass-homepage-copy.jpg","fileMasterId":48621743,"fileName":"Mercedes-Eclass-homepage-copy.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":469293,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>The Car:</h3>\n<strong>Price:</strong> $66,290 (sedan) and $69,230 (wagon) as tested (including destination charge)</br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.5-liter direct injection V-6, 302 horsepower</br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Seven-speed automatic with shift paddles</br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 20 mpg city/29 mpg highway (sedan); 19/26 mpg (wagon)</br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Attention Assist—monitors the driver for fatigue</br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Lane Tracking package—includes blind spot assist and lane keeping assist ($875)</br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Audi A6, BMW 5-series, Infiniti M, Lexus GS</br>\nSee more specs on E-Class models in our <a href=http://www.jeanknowscars.com/mercedes-benz/e-class/ target=\"_blank\">Car Guide.</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>What I Think:</h3>\nI have owned a range of vehicles, but my favorite by far was a 2001 Mercedes-Benz E-Class wagon.

And yet another is that you can configure the Sienna as an eight-passenger vehicle by having a second-row bench seat (the Odyssey has this, too, but the others don’t). From under $28,000 for the base model all the way up above $40,000 for the Limited, if you have any desire for a minivan, you should be able to configure one of these to suit you.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"left","altText":"minivan buyers

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

With this minivan as your base of operations, there is no field trip, no trip to a travel soccer game, no weekend at the beach or commute to school for which you will be unprepared.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"And that had better be the case for a vehicle that, in this top-of-the-line form, costs almost $45,000. For that kind of money, I want to feel cosseted in luxury and prepared for anything, and I had both feelings while driving the Odyssey.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"You won’t be mistaken about whether you’re in a minivan or not. From the time you pull the door open, you are confronted by acres of plastic, which is only somewhat ameliorated by the leather seating. That cavernous feeling may be foreign to the person who is used to a small, sporty car, but it’s part of the roominess and versatility that a minivan is all about.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Driving it, you are also not mistaken about the size of the thing. You are driving a 4,500-pound, 16.9-foot-long van. Having said that, it accelerates nimbly, handles smoothly, and has light, intuitive steering—although almost too light for my comfort. I was driving across town in this Odyssey when a tremendous rain whipped up, flooding city streets in what was later called a once-in-fifty-year storm. The next day, the Ann Arbor<em> News</em> displayed photos and videos of people kayaking down side streets. I felt absolutely protected inside the Odyssey as I navigated around the city, seeking out the highest-sitting neighborhoods and avoiding the high water. The ability to calmly manage adverse conditions is a great test of any vehicle, and the Odyssey won my trust right then.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Among the can’t-live-without amenities that you’d get used to quickly are a “cool box” below the stereo controls, big enough to keep your Diet Coke and yogurt or a dozen juice boxes nice and cool while you drive; a truly tremendous number of places to plug in and charge (no more fights over the outlet up front; there are two); and the flip-up trash bag ring, solving the constant problem of a trash receptacle that doesn’t roll around on the floor of the van or get tipped over.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"The second-row seats roll forward and back into place, making it easy to gain access to the third row. The center seat in that row folds down into a center console for two passengers, eliminating fights about personal space. Don’t worry, they’ll think of something else to argue about!","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"The Odyssey comes in LX, EX, Touring, and Touring Elite trim levels. The 2014 model has just gone on sale, with pricing for the base model only about $150 higher than its 2013 counterpart, and all models now have a six-speed automatic transmission. (For 2013, only the Touring- and Touring Elite-level Odysseys did.) The Touring Elite model I drove has several features you don’t get on the entry-level model, but the base LX’s price is a reasonable $29,655 for 2014, including destination, and you still get the capable 248-horsepower V-6 and a whole lot of great safety and convenience features.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"There are several good reasons to spring for the higher-end Odyssey, though. The EX-L and Touring/Touring Elite models have the ultra-wide 16.2-inch rear DVD system, the high-end audio, that cool box up front, and, on the top Touring Elite for 2014, the awesome integrated vacuum (right) in the back. Less frivolously, they also have lane departure warning, forward collision warning, and a blind spot information system. I think a big reason to go out and buy a new car or minivan this year is that all these technologies are becoming available. There’s nothing a distracted minivan pilot needs more (besides a trip to Starbucks) than systems that help keep her as aware as possible and her passengers safer as a result.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<h3>The Verdict:</h3>\r\nIf I were shopping for a minivan right now, and price were no object, I would get one of the higher trim levels (Touring or Touring Elite) of the 2014 Odyssey without a backward glance. Then I’d enjoy finding ways to use all the seat configurations, the cup holders, the outlets, and the video capability while going on lots of long road trips in it. A minivan this versatile kind of makes you want to go out and have a bunch of kids, or start a band, or gather four or five old friends and go on a long, long drive.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<h3>Peanut Gallery:</h3>\r\n<strong>Molly:</strong> Love the design of the center instrument panel; the angle is perfect for quick access while keeping my eyes on the road. The navigation screen's location is perfect for actually reading the screen because it is not affected by glare, but it is really far away from the driver. I also liked the \"title\" button that brought up song titles, but I would prefer to have the radio screen integrated with the navigation screen.</br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<strong>Christina:</strong> If you're going to have a minivan, this is definitely the one to have. I love the way the seats slide back and forth and fold down by just pulling a lever or a strap. You can do almost everything with one hand! The rear visibility is fantastic, and the car is spacious enough to offer you and your passengers enough room to be comfortable, but not enough to feel like you're driving a yacht down the road. This one is a winner.</br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"<strong>Annie: </strong>I'm still a long way off from the <em>Married With Children</em> portion of my life, so it's hard for me to imagine a minivan as my car of choice. I wasn't a fan of the Odyssey's big, boat-like attitude, but I was duly impressed by the wide array of comfort features this top-of-the-line Odyssey offered. From a drink cooler built into the center console, to the dual-screen DVD player, to the acres and acres of space between passengers, it's easy to see why families fall for the Odyssey. Ask me again in ten years.</br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<strong>Scott:</strong> I took the Odyssey on a 150-mile round trip carrying my video equipment on the way there and the equipment for myself and another videographer on the way back. It was a lot of stuff. Everything fit snugly, and nothing was rolling around, yet there was still room for two passengers in the back. I have always driven Hondas and always liked them because they’re durable; you can run them into the ground. So maybe I’m biased, but I think the Odyssey is great.</br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"<strong>Jean: </strong> I like how refined all the controls are, especially for the people in the back. I don't personally like the video screen hanging down, because I can't bend my neck back like that without getting dizzy, and tilting the seat back, although a great feature, doesn't much help. If you're looking for a minivan, this Odyssey is great, but if you think adults will be comfortable looking at the screen in the second row, guess again. The video screen would be much better just in the back of the headrest, even for a kid.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite","fileMasterId":50235595,"fileName":"2013_Odyssey_Touring_05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50235595/2013_Odyssey_Touring_05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite","fileMasterId":50235667,"fileName":"2013_Odyssey_Touring_header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50235667/2013_Odyssey_Touring_header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite","fileMasterId":50235943,"fileName":"2013_Odyssey_Touring_07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50235943/2013_Odyssey_Touring_07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite interior","fileMasterId":50235601,"fileName":"2012_Odyssey_Touring_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50235601/2012_Odyssey_Touring_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite","fileMasterId":50235604,"fileName":"2012_Odyssey_Touring_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50235604/2012_Odyssey_Touring_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite with seats folded","fileMasterId":50235598,"fileName":"2012_Odyssey_Touring_04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50235598/2012_Odyssey_Touring_04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":351},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Honda Odyssey Touring Elite","fileMasterId":50235475,"fileName":"2012_Odyssey_Touring_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50235475/2012_Odyssey_Touring_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":15,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20513,"make":"Honda","model":"Odyssey","year":2013},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":8},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:08:49.520-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865729522 }} },{ "_id":346558,"title":"4th of July Playlists!","subTitle":"Like our selections?","slug":"listen-to-our-4th-of-july-playlists","promoTitle":"4th of July Playlists!","promoTeaserSmall":"We've chosen the songs we most want to listen to while in the car or elsewhere on Independence Day.","promoTeaser":"We've chosen the songs we most want to listen to while in the car or elsewhere on Independence Day.","keywords":["4th of July Playlists!"],"metaTitle":"4th of July Playlists! - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["playlists","music","staff music selection","Jean Jennings music","Annie White music","Christina Lawson music","Molly Jean music","Scott Allen music"],"metaDescription":"Listen to Our 4th of July Playlists and send us yours.

Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Soapbox","id":1034787,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life/soapbox","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-07-03T07:15:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 fiat 500L","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54407799/fiat500L-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":54407799,"fileName":"fiat500L-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-07-03T07:15:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 fiat 500L","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/49011950/fiat500L-header.jpg","fileMasterId":49011950,"fileName":"fiat500L-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-07-03T07:15:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2014 fiat 500L","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/49011845/fiat500L-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":49011845,"fileName":"fiat500L-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":469933,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>Looking Back and Moving Forward</h3>I was dashing out of the building, on my way to grab an espresso before heading to the airport.

I kept returning to that image and the issue of Fiat nostalgia in general as I flew to Baltimore. The Fiat 500 consciously tries to evoke a sense of longing for a European way of life—small, sexy cars, mountain roads, and beautiful vistas. This romantic image leaves little room for the hassles, if one cares to see them that way, inherent to that way of life—cars too small to carry more than two or three people, no place for luggage or groceries, an engine lacking power to see you over the next hill.

At dinner the first evening, I happened to sit with the lead product engineer. He quickly surmised that I was not exactly an automotive journalist of the usual sort and wouldn’t (well, couldn’t, actually) grill him on specs, torque, and suspension.

Another journalist, upon discovering that I had lived in Italy, was asking advice about his honeymoon. His touring plans were ambitious—Venice, Florence, Rome, Sicily, and Greece in two weeks leaves little time for … sleep. We turned to Fabrizio, and I was struck with the manner in which he could extol the virtues of different Italian cities with a sensitivity to language that captured their individual essence while painting a vibrant visual image.

The marketing pitch for this car focuses on hip and urban, directed at those in their twenties and thirties with friends or young families who want the Fiat association but need more space for their way of life. The names of the different models—the Pop, the Easy, the Trekking, and the Lounge—evoke a certain joie de vivre and an active urban lifestyle.

Acutely aware of the implications of introducing a new vehicle to the Fiat brand, Fabrizio opened his presentation with the very first Fiat 500—the Topolino (right). Produced in 1936 under the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini, the Topolino was meant to be a car for the masses and a form of affordable transportation for Il Duce’s modern industrial nation. It was, in fact, the precursor to Germany’s Volkswagen, which means “people’s car.” A term of endearment—the name Topolino means “little mouse” and is what Italians call Mickey Mouse—the name was meant to evoke association with the advanced modern society of America and the American way of living.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"In an interesting turn, the American way of living is also the basis for the articulation of the 500L. Spatial considerations, not hard edges, shaped the outlines of the vehicle. Such an approach toward space and design drove the design of the Italian <em>palazzo</em> and <em>villa</em> for centuries—utilitarian spaces on the ground floor; spaces for living and socializing on what is called the <em>piano nobile</em>, the broad and spacious first floor; and then more utilitarian spaces above on the second floor. The Italian palazzo essentially evolved from the inside out, and so, too, did the design of the 500L.

How does the interior space relate to and reflect lifestyle? These are distinctly Italian questions. There, the car is not just a means of transportation but also is often considered an additional room and exterior space to the house. Indeed, the inspiration for the spatial organization of the 500L was not a past vehicle, but the modernist iconic interpretation of the Italian palazzo/villa design, Le Corbusier’s Villa Savoye. Built in 1928 in France, the Villa Savoye sought to reduce the villa design to its fundamental elements and translate that expression with the most modern of materials. The emphasis focuses on the piano nobile and articulates that space of living with steel and glass, the modern materials allowing a panoramic view that takes in the countryside around it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"When Fabrizio put up the slide of the Villa Savoye, the overall design of the 500L suddenly made sense. While the slightly quirky and bulbous exterior of the 500L pays homage to the exterior lines of the Topolino, the interior draws directly from the history of modernist architecture. The frame alludes to the steel structure, and the rest is filled with windows. Their glass wraps the car, providing an exceptional panoramic view that mimics the living spaces of the Villa Savoye.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"<strong>How does the thought given to design translate into the driving experience? I drove a black 500L through the streets and highways of Baltimore.</strong> The exterior takes getting used to, but, like the Cinquecento itself, its quirky lines quickly became charming in comparison with the prosaic lines of so many other vehicles on the road. The spatial effect of the interior conceptualization struck me immediately. The panoramic view opens the space and is, in fact, quite liberating. One does not feel constrained in a “small car space,” and I found my viewpoint from the driver's seat equal to the spatial experience and open field of vision one gets sitting high up in an SUV. That delighted me, as a small woman who can rarely see the hood of the car she is driving.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2014 fiat 500L","caption":"","fileMasterId":54407892,"fileName":"fiat500L_05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54407892/fiat500L_05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":17,"text":"I was worried that the size of the gearshift, designed to maintain proportion with the voluminous interior, would be far too big for my hand, but instead it was remarkably comfortable, and I could shift with ease. Having always had five-speed manuals, the six-speed dual-clutch transmission required me to adjust my driving patterns, but I did so quickly. My driving partner and I have quite eclectic tastes in music, and the Beats audio system responded so sonorously with all genres that it made me realize that it might be the guilty pleasure in which one must indulge, particularly if we agree that the car is an extension of the house.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":18,"text":"To continue that theme, how many of us have had to chastise a teenager for putting dirty feet on the sofa? Although it is not safe to put your feet on the dash, my dashboard is scuffed from teenage transgressions. The dash in the 500L is covered with a fabric that echoes the fabric of the seats. The fabric may be tough, but could it withstand snagging and scuffing from heels? Like the modernist aesthetic that drove the design, the interior has a crisp, clean feel. But it’s fair to say that the modernist aesthetic often ignores the realities of teenage living, and this is no different. It’s an impractical spot for fabric. Fabric in general is impractical with children, and were I to get the 500L, leather seats would be a must. These are niggling complaints, though, for what otherwise is a car that brings a certain flair and difference to this particular segment of the market.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":19,"text":"<strong>It would seem, then, that the 500L brings the history of the Cinquecento full circle.</strong> At its price points, starting at $19,900 for the Pop and going to $24,995 for the Lounge, it is not exactly a people’s car. However, it is priced aggressively to bring in the young urban buyers looking for the ease and convenience of a small car but wanting a vehicle that sets them—and their lifestyle—apart from the usual car-buying public. <br>\n<br>\n\nFrom a practical standpoint—drive, interior layout, audio systems, seating, and manipulation of space—this car works well. From a sense of style and history, it certainly distinguishes the driver from the rest of the pack.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

The ATS is a luxury performance sedan at heart, with standard rear-wheel drive and an available 321-horsepower V-6 engine. Cadillac is hoping that the ATS will draw new, younger buyers to the brand, which suffers from an aging demographic. I’m normally turned off by Cadillac’s boxy, angular design language, but the ATS caught my attention, so I took one for a drive to see if it would change my mind.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"The ATS I tested was a Premium model, with standard leather seats, an eight-inch touchscreen with Cadillac’s CUE infotainment interface, and magnesium paddle shifters. Our test car also included a $1,050 power sunroof; the Driver Awareness package, which includes lane departure warning and front collision alert; and the $600 Cold Weather package, which gets you heated front seats and a heated steering wheel.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"dogs in hot cars","caption":"","fileMasterId":54718344,"fileName":"cadillac_ats08.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54718344/cadillac_ats08.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":3,"text":"The ATS’s striking exterior, with its long, teardrop-shaped headlights and tight angles, is a perfect companion to the sleek, luxurious interior.

Nothing wrong with that. What a pleasant experience, then, to see that this ATS has an interior color scheme, instrument panel trim, and display that are just as wild and different from the routine as ever. Because we're Americans! And that's what we do. Somewhere in middle Ohio, a new ATS owner is showing it off to the neighborhood kids. I hope their mouths are dropping open. They ought to be.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"<strong>Jean:</strong> If you like luxury, if you like a bit of edge and performance with your luxury, and if you like to buy American, then you should look at the ATS. The steering is a precise, finely tuned weapon, and the engine adds a little dramatic background noise. Shifts are better in manual mode, though still a tad lazy. Brakes are the best—Brembos—and the suspension damping is very refined, although it’s best at high speeds than lower. The space age interior controls, high-gloss carbon fiber trim, and iPad-like CUE navigation screen give the ATS a dash of techno that blends surprisingly well with the luxe leather. (I didn’t say I liked CUE, did I?) Altogether, it’s a cozy place to be, especially if you’re single.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"Annie White behind the wheel of the 2013 Cadillac ATS","fileMasterId":54718401,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54718401/cadillac_ats_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS","fileMasterId":54718344,"fileName":"cadillac_ats08.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54718344/cadillac_ats08.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS","fileMasterId":54718392,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54718392/cadillac_ats_07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS","fileMasterId":50718988,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_10.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50718988/cadillac_ats_10.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS interior","fileMasterId":54718320,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_09.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54718320/cadillac_ats_09.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS interior","fileMasterId":50718739,"fileName":"cadillac_ats03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50718739/cadillac_ats03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS interior","fileMasterId":50718736,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50718736/cadillac_ats_04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS interior","fileMasterId":54718395,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54718395/cadillac_ats_06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS detail","fileMasterId":50718733,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/50718733/cadillac_ats_05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":8,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2013 Cadillac ATS detail","fileMasterId":54718350,"fileName":"cadillac_ats_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/54718350/cadillac_ats_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":9,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":13,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":9},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:08:54.228-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865734229 }} },{ "_id":346801,"title":"Excuse Our Dust!","subTitle":"Check out our new look on Wednesday, 7/17/2013","slug":"excuse-our-dust","promoTitle":"Excuse Our Dust!","promoTeaserSmall":"Our redesigned website goes live again in a few days.

But back here in Michigan, I wondered: How far in the direction of modern luxury did Buick take this face-lifted LaCrosse? Did the company go too far and alienate the base of retired guys who play a little golf? Or not far enough, and eliminate itself from competition with newer mid-luxury brands that are more attractive to modern shoppers?

Too far to the left? A left jiggle. The right? A right jiggle. An appreciated, if squicky-feeling, safety feature. So much more tolerable than an annoying chime sound.

It is important to mention, though, that the base 2014 LaCrosse starts at $34,060, including destination. That one has a 2.4-liter four-cylinder and much better fuel economy (25 mpg in town and 36 mpg on the highway), although you can also get the V-6 at no additional charge over the four. If my dad actually shocked the family by deciding to replace his LeSabre with a new car, that’s the one he would get.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

This was a much better riding and driving vehicle and included, for the first time, standard torque vectoring, which aids the car when it’s going through turns<br>\n•\tThe third generation has an all-new body and a proprietary platform, whereas the last two were based on the Odyssey’s platform. The MDX’s platform will be adapted to other vehicles later<br>\n•\tLike the second-generation MDX, the 2014 model was tested at the famous Nürburgring racetrack in Germany, where many hot performance cars are tested. It’s Acura’s internal benchmark proving ground. And it was eight seconds a lap faster than the last one<br> \n•\tThe Acura team considered the third row as extra seating and didn’t make it  bigger because most of their customers don’t use a third row: they want to know it’s there, but most of them fold it down<br>\n•\tThe MDX is now an inch narrower to make it easier to park. At the same time, the space between the front and back wheels (the wheelbase) is three inches longer, which gives the cabin more flexibility<br>\n•\tThe corners of the car are more visible, the A-pillars are thinner, the size of the side mirrors is bigger, and the instrument panel is set higher—all to make it easier to maneuver for shorter people<br>\n•\tThe holy grail of engineering is removing weight.
