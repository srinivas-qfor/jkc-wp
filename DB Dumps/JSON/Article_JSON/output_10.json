Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-05T14:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-12","title":"the weekly windup 12 6","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62716378/ww-12.6.2013-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62716378,"fileName":"ww-12.6.2013-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-05T14:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-12","title":"the weekly windup 12 6","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62716375/ww-12.6.2013-header.jpg","fileMasterId":62716375,"fileName":"ww-12.6.2013-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-05T14:12:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ww-12","title":"the weekly windup 12 6","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62716378/ww-12.6.2013-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62716378,"fileName":"ww-12.6.2013-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":593243,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>1.</strong> Time for a vacation: Book a ticket <a href=\"http://www.wallpaper.com/art/photographer-fabian-oefner-tricks-the-eye-at-mad-gallery-in-geneva/7010#91004\" title=\"Wallpaper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">to Geneva.</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"or <a href=\"http://www.wallpaper.com/art/full-throttle-a-fleet-of-supercharged-art-cars-goes-on-show-in-miami/7017\" title=\"Miami\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miami.</a> <br>\n<br>\nOr both, and celebrate cars as art.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Alt Fuel","id":1034784,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/car-alt-fuel","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-05T05:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford-cmax-homepage","title":"ford c max energi challenge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62672506/ford-cmax-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62672506,"fileName":"ford-cmax-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-05T05:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford-cmax-header","title":"ford c max energi challenge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62672503/ford-cmax-header.jpg","fileMasterId":62672503,"fileName":"ford-cmax-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-05T05:59:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford-cmax-homepage","title":"ford c max energi challenge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62672506/ford-cmax-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":62672506,"fileName":"ford-cmax-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":592972,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2013 Ford C-Max Energi Plug-In Hybrid</h3>\n<strong>Price:</strong> $37,820 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder, 141 horsepower (188 total system horsepower) <br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Continuously variable automatic (e-CVT) <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 44 mpg city/41 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Leather-trimmed seats and steering wheel<br>\n<strong>Option I can’t live without:</strong> Panoramic sunroof ($1,195)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Chevrolet Volt, Honda Accord Plug-In Hybrid, Toyota Prius Plug-In Hybrid<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"ford c max energi challenge","caption":"","fileMasterId":62672488,"fileName":"ford-cmax-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62672488/ford-cmax-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":1,"text":"No matter what your feelings are about electric or hybrid vehicles, pretty much everyone agrees that carmakers are going to have to do something in coming years to increase fuel economy.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-05T06:23:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"willow_homepage","title":"willow run plant","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61043164/willow-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61043164,"fileName":"willow-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-05T06:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"willow_interior_eastbay","title":"willow run plant","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62595066/willow-interior-eastbay.jpg","fileMasterId":62595066,"fileName":"willow-interior-eastbay.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-11-05T06:23:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"willow_homepage","title":"willow run plant","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61043164/willow-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61043164,"fileName":"willow-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":571950,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"willow run plant","caption":"","fileMasterId":62595051,"fileName":"willow_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62595051/willow_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"As I walked into the Arsenal of Democracy/Willow Run Conference, marking the closing of the Willow Run Bomber Plant near Ypsilanti, Michigan, and saw that the path to the conference room was lined with guides dressed up as “Rosie the Riveter,” I felt a little out of place.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"When I hear the word \"conference,\" I move into academic mode and expect talks of remote history, often laced with vocabulary drawn from impenetrable theoretical texts that only make sense when discussed over a bottle or two of wine.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"willow run plant","caption":"","fileMasterId":62595057,"fileName":"willow_crowd-at-open-house.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/62595057/willow_crowd-at-open-house.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":2,"text":"No “Rosie the Riveters” generally line the halls, and the audience certainly isn’t filled with men in bomber jackets sporting baseball caps (and I don’t mean of the “swag” kind).

The bomber plant’s history is inextricably linked to the Detroit auto industry and its response to World War II.  In 1940, the United States government, recognizing an urgent need to massively expand American production of military arsenal—everything from tanks to anti-aircraft guns to munitions to planes—turned to the auto industry, as only its mechanized processes of mass production could answer the need for such high volume at such a short period of time.  It was a time of unprecedented cooperation among automakers; indeed, they agreed to suspend the 1943 model year to allow tool-and-die makers to work for the war effort.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"Willow Run Bomber Plant, built by Henry Ford on his private land, came to represent the auto industry’s involvement in the war effort and in the country’s creation of an Arsenal of Democracy.  Ford had originally been commissioned to mass produce subassemblies for the B-24 and B-29 bombers, which were to be manufactured at Consolidated Aircraft. A team from Ford visited Consolidated’s California facility, noticed its lack of standardized modes of production, went home, and asked for (and received) total production of the B-24. So it was that on April 18, 1941, the ground was broken for the building of Willow Run.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h4>Architecture by Albert Kahn</h4>\nWhile the story of the plant’s significant contribution to the war effort surprised me, I was also struck by the fact that the factory was designed as a purpose-built site for airplane manufacture by the architect Albert Kahn.

Yet Kahn, too, is inextricably linked to the auto industry in Detroit, and his firm singlehandedly transformed the landscape of southeastern Michigan in the first decades of the twentieth century. He was responsible for numerous factories, the Fisher Building in Detroit, and Hill Auditorium and Angell Hall at the University of Michigan. His challenge, to create an efficient industrial space, was shared by many architects in the first half of the century.

At its peak, Willow Run was producing one B-24 bomber per hour. Such rates of production required the labor force of 42,000 workers, 40 percent of whom were women. Many of these women drew inspiration from the national propaganda campaign featuring Rosie the Riveter, an idealized strong, beautiful, patriotic woman who selflessly leapt into the workforce to help produce the items needed for war. Willow Run Bomber Plant employee Rose Will Monroe, one of many who migrated to the Detroit area from Kentucky, came to embody the ethos of Rosie the Riveter.

He was the product of love from the factory floor, as were many others in the audience.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact.

Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-13T12:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"weekly-12","title":"the weekly windup 12 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64614657/weekly-12.13-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":64614657,"fileName":"weekly-12.13-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-13T12:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"weekly-12-copy","title":"the weekly windup 12 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64614858/weekly-12-copy.13-header","fileMasterId":64614858,"fileName":"weekly-12-copy.13-header","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-13T12:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"weekly-12","title":"the weekly windup 12 13","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64614657/weekly-12.13-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":64614657,"fileName":"weekly-12.13-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":594703,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>1.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/12/12/survey-electric-cars/3999453/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>USA Today</em></a> informs us that “Four out of ten drivers have lifestyles that could benefit from an EV.” Are you one of them?","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>2.</strong> Do I have a witness?

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.

The fact that this one starts just under $20,000 is a definite enticement to the first-time car buyer or, really, anybody who is in the market for an affordable vehicle. There are four levels to the 500L lineup: the entry-level Pop, which costs $19,995 with destination charge; the Easy, the car we tested, which starts at $20,995; the higher-end Lounge, and the off-road-styled Trekking (which only looks rugged).","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"left","altText":"2014 fiat 500l easy","caption":"","fileMasterId":59292167,"fileName":"fiat-500l-14.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/59292167/fiat-500l-14.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":4,"text":"I happen to really like the way the 500L looks, and my eighteen-year-old son, Henry, a cranky iconoclast whose tastes run to ancient Volvos, agreed with me as he climbed into the passenger's seat.

They do come in other colors; I'd go for dark surfaces myself. And then, the overall feeling was just not quirky. Compared with, say, the goofy instrument panel of the Smart Fortwo or the Mini Countryman, the switchgear was bland and disappointingly ordinary. A notable exception was the excellent Beats audio system, a $700 package that included SiriusXM with a one-year subscription. The heated front seats ($350) were much appreciated given the weather and, I increasingly believe, a must-have on a new car for anyone in cool climates.

It only missed the latest 2014 rating, issued this week, because Fiat doesn't offer front crash prevention technology (such as forward collision warning systems), a new IIHS requirement this year. The 500L is fitted with front and rear head curtain airbags and front seat-mounted torso airbags. There's also a separate driver's-side knee airbag in the lower instrument panel to help mitigate knee injuries in front crashes.

But, rising gas prices notwithstanding, it's not clear to me whether Americans really want one of those.

That's interesting, because the 1.4-liter MultiAir turbo is the same engine I enjoyed in the Dodge Dart.

The choice of materials seems cheap, and I especially think the seat material feels and looks bargain basement. And, where is the sublime mint green exterior paint choice? However, bravo to those same designers, because once inside, it feels downright spacious. What the 500L loses in style cred, it gains in affordability and usefulness. With its $19,995 base price (including destination), the 500L would definitely be a contender if I was buying my daughter a spankin' new vehicle.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-20T11:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"12","title":"weekly windup 12 20","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65602005/12.20.2013-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65602005,"fileName":"12.20.2013-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-20T11:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"12","title":"weekly windup 12 20","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65601999/12.20.2013-header.jpg","fileMasterId":65601999,"fileName":"12.20.2013-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-20T11:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"12","title":"weekly windup 12 20","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65602005/12.20.2013-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65602005,"fileName":"12.20.2013-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":595475,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Tom Salt is one of the very best car photographers in the world, but apparently he is also a damn good videographer.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Road Trips","id":1034777,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-road-trips","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-17T13:51:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"wjd-12","title":"what i drove last weekend 12 16","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63425416/wjd-12.17-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63425416,"fileName":"wjd-12.17-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-17T13:51:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"wjd-12","title":"what i drove last weekend 12 16","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63425368/wjd-12.17-01.jpg","fileMasterId":63425368,"fileName":"wjd-12.17-01.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-17T13:51:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"wjd-12","title":"what i drove last weekend 12 16","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63425416/wjd-12.17-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63425416,"fileName":"wjd-12.17-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":594852,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Every now and then—not often—the professional automotive journalist is faced with the horror of renting a car.

I have gone with him to dog shows where he’s put me in a Motel 6, including one that the police cruised by every ten minutes because it was such a bad neighborhood, in Louisville, Kentucky.

I have been traveling for thirty-three years, and I no longer need to get a $39 hotel room.” He was smart enough to pack up everything right then, in the middle of the night, and take me to a Holiday Inn, which by the way had dog biscuits in a bowl on the front desk when we checked in.

So I turned around, and I couldn’t remember what room I was in.” While he was talking, I was just sitting there, dumbfounded.

Fortunately, they hadn’t. “Good,” said Jeremy, carefully studying the interior of this handy storage area. “I don’t think that’s a good use of space.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-24T06:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"playlist-homepage","title":"christmas playlist","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63783814/playlist-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63783814,"fileName":"playlist-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-24T06:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"playlist-header","title":"christmas playlist","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63783811/playlist-header.jpg","fileMasterId":63783811,"fileName":"playlist-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-24T06:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"playlist-homepage","title":"christmas playlist","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/63783814/playlist-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":63783814,"fileName":"playlist-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":595600,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"We never miss an opportunity to put together an event-specific playlist.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I’m no twenty-five-year-old, but like the town of Holly, I can look back and honor the twenty-five-year-old I once was by holding a festive commemorative weekend, and that’s exactly what I did.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Mazda 3 S Grand Touring","fileMasterId":66108456,"fileName":"mazda3-header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66108456/mazda3-header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Mazda 3 S Grand Touring","fileMasterId":66108444,"fileName":"mazda3-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66108444/mazda3-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1011},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1592}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Mazda 3 S Grand Touring","fileMasterId":66108441,"fileName":"mazda3-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66108441/mazda3-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":947},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":1491}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Mazda 3 S Grand Touring","fileMasterId":66108450,"fileName":"mazda3-05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66108450/mazda3-05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2014 Mazda 3 S Grand Touring","fileMasterId":66108453,"fileName":"mazda3-06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66108453/mazda3-06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":17,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":35633,"make":"Mazda","model":"MAZDA3","year":2014},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:12:16.652-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865936653 }} },{ "_id":454248,"title":"2014 Honda Accord Coupe","subTitle":"","slug":"2014-honda-accord-coupe","promoTitle":"2014 Honda Accord Coupe","promoTeaserSmall":"Annie and Molly's video review of that rare bird (in 2014), the coupe.","promoTeaser":"Annie and Molly's video review of that rare bird (in 2014), the coupe.","keywords":["2014 Honda Accord Coupe"],"metaTitle":"Honda Accord Coupe - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["2014 Honda Accord","2014 Honda","2014 Honda Accord Coupe","Honda coupe","coupe body style","cars with two doors","Jean's Driveway"],"metaDescription":"Honda Accord Coupe: Molly and Annie's review of one of the few true coupes on the market.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":16190,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Molly Jean","firstName":"Molly","lastName":"Jean","jobTitle":"Senior Editor","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"When I turned sixteen, my dad brought home the very first-generation Ford Escort wagon, and it just so happened to have a manual transmission. Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-30T07:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-accord-coupe-homepage","title":"2014 honda accord coupe","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66220812/honda-accord-coupe-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66220812,"fileName":"honda-accord-coupe-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-30T07:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-accord-coupe-header","title":"2014 honda accord coupe","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66220809/honda-accord-coupe-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66220809,"fileName":"honda-accord-coupe-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-30T07:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"honda-accord-coupe-homepage","title":"2014 honda accord coupe","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66220812/honda-accord-coupe-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66220812,"fileName":"honda-accord-coupe-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":595672,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2014 Honda Accord Coupe EX-L V6 Navi</h3>\r\n<h3>Vital Stats</h3>\r\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $31,415 (includes destination)<br>\r\n<strong>This car's price:</strong> $33,190 (includes destination)<br>\r\n<strong>EPA fuel economy:</strong> 18 mpg city/28 mpg highway<br>\r\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.5-liter V-6, 278 horsepower<br>\r\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed manual<br>\r\n<strong>Safety features:</strong> Six airbags, vehicle stability assist with traction control, forward collision warning, and lane departure warning (all standard)<br>\r\n<strong>Tech features:</strong> Touchscreen audio, SiriusXM satellite radio, push-button start, MP3 and USB connectivity, heated front seats<br>\r\n<strong>Chief competitors:</strong> This is one of the few cars that stands alone in its segment.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/-jk8KnLSBjs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>Key Points</h3>\r\n• The 2014 Accord Coupe is a carryover model.<br>\r\n•  The car shown in the video is the top-of-the-line Accord Coupe model, and it has no options.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-31T11:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blooper-homepage-2","title":"outtakes reel 2013","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60072935/blooper-homepage-2.png","fileMasterId":60072935,"fileName":"blooper-homepage-2.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-31T11:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blooper-header-2","title":"outtakes reel 2013","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60072932/blooper-header-2.png","fileMasterId":60072932,"fileName":"blooper-header-2.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-12-31T11:11:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blooper-homepage-2","title":"outtakes reel 2013","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60072935/blooper-homepage-2.png","fileMasterId":60072935,"fileName":"blooper-homepage-2.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":595824,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"adSetCode":"","alignment":"block","autoPlay":0,"description":"","disableAdPreRoll":false,"embedCode":"<object classid='clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000' id='ooyalaPlayer' width='0' height='0'codebase='http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/swflash.cab'><param name='movie' value='http://www.ooyala.com/player.swf' /><param name='bgcolor' value='#000000' /><param name='wmode' value='Transparent'/><param name='allowScriptAccess' value='always' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><param name='flashvars' value='embedCode=VsNGhiajp2ACGmk93u32JVIx7V2R16mb&autoplay=0&loop=0&browserPlacement=4&width=0&height=0&wmode=Transparent' /><embed src='http://www.ooyala.com/player.swf' bgcolor='#000000' width='0' height='0' name='ooyalaPlayer' wmode='Transparent' align='middle' play='0' loop='0' allowscriptaccess='always' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowfullscreen='true' flashvars='embedCode=VsNGhiajp2ACGmk93u32JVIx7V2R16mb&autoplay=0&loop=0&browserPlacement=4&width=0&height=0&wmode=Transparent' pluginspage='http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer'> </embed></object>","height":0,"loop":0,"maintainAspectRatio":true,"ooyalaId":"1_5rp064dy","thumbnailUrl":"https://cfvod.kaltura.com/p/1807801/sp/180780100/thumbnail/entry_id/1_5rp064dy/version/100000/acv/151","transparency":"transparent","videoLength":158000,"width":0,"type":"video"},{"order":12,"text":"Here is a selection of some of our favorite moments during video shoots in 2013.

I tell them about my father, who was a Chrysler engineer, and the crazy cars he would bring home to test drive. But before I discovered the glamorous life of an automotive journalist, I was a writer living in the Motor City, covering music and art in the Nineties. Things changed when I became curious about the industry that made the city tick and interned at <em>AutoWeek </em>magazine. \n\nI moved to New York City in 2003, where I’ve worked as a freelance writer for almost a decade. I’ve written for more than 100 magazines, newspapers, and websites, including the New York <em>Times, Rolling Stone, Forbes, Jay-z’s Life and Times, Vibe, Automobile Magazine, AutoWeek</em> and the Detroit <em>Free Press.</em> I finished an MFA in creative writing at the New School this year. I live with two car buffs, Lee Quiñones and our four-year-old son, who both think what I do is pretty cool.","fileMasterId":39801671,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801671/39801671.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,10009,6202044,6202090]},{"id":10362,"roles":["Videographer"],"displayName":"Scott Allen","firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Allen","jobTitle":"Videographer","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"I have spent a lot of time on the road. I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-02T07:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"homepage","title":"art basel report","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60114929/homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":60114929,"fileName":"homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-02T07:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"header","title":"art basel report","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60114926/header.jpg","fileMasterId":60114926,"fileName":"header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":499}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-02T07:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"homepage","title":"art basel report","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60114929/homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":60114929,"fileName":"homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":595641,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"One of the best venues to see works of art at <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/life-with-jean/the-road-trips/what-i-drove-last-weekend-12-9/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Art Basel Miami</a> in December was not at the art fair, but on an entire floor of the Herzog & de Meuron parking garage-turned-art- car-gallery on 1111 Lincoln Road. “Piston Head: Artists Engage the Automobile\" was an exhibition timed to Art Basel that explored the power, refuse, and imagination induced by car culture.","type":"paragraph"},{"adSetCode":"","alignment":"block","autoPlay":0,"description":"","disableAdPreRoll":false,"embedCode":"<object classid='clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000' id='ooyalaPlayer' width='0' height='0'codebase='http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/swflash.cab'><param name='movie' value='http://www.ooyala.com/player.swf' /><param name='bgcolor' value='#000000' /><param name='wmode' value='Transparent'/><param name='allowScriptAccess' value='always' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><param name='flashvars' value='embedCode=43Nms2ajrE1HoKH2Tpf1eLB9eKgtEUb7&autoplay=0&loop=0&browserPlacement=4&width=0&height=0&wmode=Transparent' /><embed src='http://www.ooyala.com/player.swf' bgcolor='#000000' width='0' height='0' name='ooyalaPlayer' wmode='Transparent' align='middle' play='0' loop='0' allowscriptaccess='always' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowfullscreen='true' flashvars='embedCode=43Nms2ajrE1HoKH2Tpf1eLB9eKgtEUb7&autoplay=0&loop=0&browserPlacement=4&width=0&height=0&wmode=Transparent' pluginspage='http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer'> </embed></object>","height":0,"loop":0,"maintainAspectRatio":true,"ooyalaId":"1_cvgl2uwi","thumbnailUrl":"https://cfvod.kaltura.com/p/1807801/sp/180780100/thumbnail/entry_id/1_cvgl2uwi/version/100000/acv/151","transparency":"transparent","videoLength":149000,"width":0,"type":"video"},{"order":2,"text":"The New York gallery <a href=\"http://venusovermanhattan.com/past\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Venus Over Manhattan</a> showed fifteen art cars and one 1965 Harley motorcycle, all as imagined by serious contemporary artists.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-02T20:21:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"homepage","title":"weekly windup 1 3","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64207291/homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":64207291,"fileName":"homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-02T20:21:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"header","title":"weekly windup 1 3","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64207288/header.jpg","fileMasterId":64207288,"fileName":"header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-02T20:21:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"homepage","title":"weekly windup 1 3","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64207291/homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":64207291,"fileName":"homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":595642,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>1.</strong> Our favorite car-lovin’ comedian doing <a href=\"http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">what he does best.</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"weekly windup 1 3","caption":"","fileMasterId":64207285,"fileName":"century-cruiser.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64207285/century-cruiser.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>2. </strong>For me, the best part of an auto show is the concept cars.

Then I post the photos and stories on Facebook. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/HumansofAnnArbor\" rel=\"”nofollow”\" target=\"”_blank”\">Humans  of Ann  Arbor</a>  has followers from all over the world who check in on a daily basis to see ordinary people and their extraordinary stories.\n\nI have been studying people since I was a little girl in Missouri. Where I grew up, studying people often led you to the cars they loved. My grandpa had a gas station in Claycomo, Missouri, which he opened in the 1950s, and he passed his love of cars and taking care of the people who drove them down to my dad. Dad was a mechanic and a service supervisor all his life. We had a steady barrage of cars coming into our lives…mostly Chevys. To impress my dad, I learned to identify every car I could, and I used to name the cars while we drove down the road. Car culture is big in Missouri. Would you believe that I had friends who were sisters named Nova and Chevelle? If\nyou didn’t grow up the way I did, you might not get the significance of that, but suffice it to say that my people love their cars.\n\nThe car I adored most was the Chevrolet Corvair my dad gave me when I was in high school. It spent more time in my dad's shop than it did on the road, but in those moments when it was drivable, I knew what it was to love a car. It was a thing of beauty: pale cream with a plaid madras interior. I loved the sound and feel of the engine…it was more like a soft purr than a roar. I can still remember how it smelled and what it was like to drive it with the windows rolled down on a warm day. I've had lots of cars since then, and I loved some of them, too. But the Corvair was my first car love and will always be my favorite.\n\nAfter high school, I drove my car to Springfield, Missouri, to study communications at Missouri State. Later, I drove a different car to Chicago to study photography at Columbia College. I worked in Chicago as a freelance photographer and studio manager for many years before moving to Ann Arbor, where I continue to do freelance photography. I am excited about combining my love of studying people with my interest in cars. I want to explore how cars serve us, how they are intertwined in our lives, and what makes us love them. I can't wait to let you know what I find out.","fileMasterId":66360111,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66360111/66360111.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Whole Famn Damily","id":1034774,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/kids-in-the-car/whole-famn-damily","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Kids in the Car","id":1034769,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-05T14:04:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"photo-homepage","title":"The Car Stays in the Picture","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66404883/photo-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66404883,"fileName":"photo-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-05T14:04:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"photo-header","title":"The Car Stays in the Picture","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66404880/photo-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66404880,"fileName":"photo-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-05T14:04:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"photo-homepage","title":"The Car Stays in the Picture","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66404883/photo-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66404883,"fileName":"photo-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":596177,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"The Car Stays in the Picture","caption":"","fileMasterId":66404868,"fileName":"photo-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66404868/photo-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"“When my parents were cool” is the caption under a photo a friend recently posted on social media.

Five years later, Jennings went to Chrysler’s test track where she worked as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, she was hired as a writer at <em>Car and Driver</em> magazine when she was laid off her Chrysler job, and in 1985 she left to establish <em>Automobile Magazine</em> with David E.

Kevin is not only passionate about his Titan, but deeply committed to wildlife management.  He repairs fences and tracks returning flora and fauna, helping to restore various local lands to their pre-developed states.  These are properties that have been decimated from years of pasturing horses, cattle, and goats.  He shows me pup tents, where deer are photographed and counted.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-09T13:20:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"detroit-homepage","title":"detroit playlist modern","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64587190/detroit-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":64587190,"fileName":"detroit-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-09T13:20:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"detroit-header","title":"detroit playlist modern","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64586944/detroit-header.jpg","fileMasterId":64586944,"fileName":"detroit-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-09T13:20:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"detroit-homepage","title":"detroit playlist modern","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/64587190/detroit-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":64587190,"fileName":"detroit-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":596743,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"If you're headed into Detroit, as we are next week for the North American International Auto Show, you'll want to listen to some of the fine, fine music that the city has long been known for.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-08T12:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"toyota-land-cruiser-homepage2","title":"2013 toyota highlander on the road","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66577593/toyota-land-cruiser-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":66577593,"fileName":"toyota-land-cruiser-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-08T12:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"toyota-land-cruiser-header","title":"2013 toyota highlander on the road","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66577569/toyota-land-cruiser-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66577569,"fileName":"toyota-land-cruiser-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-08T12:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"toyota-land-cruiser-homepage2","title":"2013 toyota highlander on the road","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66577593/toyota-land-cruiser-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":66577593,"fileName":"toyota-land-cruiser-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":596701,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Price:</strong> $78,555 base price of this model<br>\n$79,728 as tested (including destination) <br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 5.7-liter V-8, 381 horsepower, 401 pound-feet of torque, full-time four-wheel drive<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed automatic transmission with sequential shift mode and uphill/downhill shift <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 13 mpg city/18 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong>Center console cooler<br>\n<strong>Options I can’t live without:</strong> all-weather floor and carpet mats ($250), remote starter ($425), ball mount and trailer ball ($98)<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Multi-terrain select, hill start control, crawl control with off-road turn assist, multi-terrain monitor, DVD rear entertainment system<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Cadillac Escalade, Land Rover Range Rover, Mercedes-Benz GL-Class<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"For me, winter calls for a vehicle that can handle snow, haul a lot of people, and cover many miles comfortably.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Lunacy","id":1034778,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-lunacy","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-12T13:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"jean-model-homepage","title":"do you come with the car honey","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60503630/jean-model-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":60503630,"fileName":"jean-model-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-12T13:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"jean-model-header","title":"do you come with the car honey","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60503624/jean-model-header.jpg","fileMasterId":60503624,"fileName":"jean-model-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-12T13:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"jean-model-homepage","title":"do you come with the car honey","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60503630/jean-model-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":60503630,"fileName":"jean-model-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":462341,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<em>Detroit</em>—They say that all manly conversations eventually degenerate into talk about one of two topics: women and cars.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-09T13:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"detroit-homepage","title":"detroit playlist modern","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66717138/detroit-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66717138,"fileName":"detroit-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":289},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":592}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-09T13:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"detroit-header","title":"detroit playlist modern","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66717126/detroit-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66717126,"fileName":"detroit-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-09T13:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"detroit-homepage","title":"detroit playlist modern","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66717138/detroit-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":66717138,"fileName":"detroit-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":289},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":592}}},"pages":[{"id":596742,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"If you, like us, are spending this week in Detroit for the North American International Auto Show, you'll want to listen to some of the fine, fine music that the city has long been known for.

His race report on the 12 Hours of Sebring was published when he was an eighteen-year-old Art Center student in 1954. Subsequently he has published thousands of articles on cars and airplanes, in American, Asian, English, European, and South American magazines. He contributed to several books, including the entire text of the well-reviewed <em>Auto Legends</em>, now available in five translated editions -- French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Polish in addition to the original English version. In 1985, <em>Automobile Magazine</em> founder David E. Davis, Jr., invited him to be one of two executive editors when <em>Automobile</em> was in the planning stages. Cumberford demurred, saying he knew nothing about magazine production and claims he still doesn’t, except that it’s important to meet deadlines. He contributed features from the beginning and began his popular “By Design” column in the sixth issue, September 1986.  \n<br><br>\nIn car design, Cumberford was even more a youthful prodigy. He sketched the body for the first car ever built to his designs when he was a fifteen-year-old Los Angeles high-school student. That car, the Parkinson Jaguar Special, is still active in historic racing sixty years after it was created. Hired directly by General Motors’ legendary Vice President of Design, Harley J. Earl, Cumberford became a professional car designer at nineteen. Leaving Detroit, he returned to California to attend UCLA to study philosophy. He rejoined the automotive world in the early 1960s and has continued to create new automotive shapes since then, always as an independent design consultant. He has lived and worked in six of the fifty United States and in France, Mexico, and Switzerland. The range of his design projects includes both racing and touring cars, trucks, aircraft, boats, hovercraft, and even ecological architecture. \n<br><br>\nHe is known worldwide for strong opinions but is well-respected in the design world because it is known that he is always completely honest in his views, with no agenda other than respect for good design and good designers. “There’s no ad hominem,” he says, “I judge the design, not the designers. There are designers I really like personally who’ve been credited with designs I heartily dislike -- for reasons I always state very clearly -- and designs I love done by people with whom I have absolutely no affinity. Except that we both like their work.”","fileMasterId":74354961,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74354961/74354961.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2022,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"rcumberford@gmail.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044,6202077]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-12T20:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"concept-homepage2","title":"how to look at a concept car","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66991284/concept-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":66991284,"fileName":"concept-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-12T20:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"concept-header2","title":"how to look at a concept car","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66991221/concept-header2.jpg","fileMasterId":66991221,"fileName":"concept-header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-12T20:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"concept-homepage2","title":"how to look at a concept car","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66991284/concept-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":66991284,"fileName":"concept-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":597202,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Auto shows are huge events in major cities all over the world.

Nor do they increase hotel and restaurant and entertainment receipts. Thus, they are often staged at times when the exposition hall rental is cheap because no one wants to visit a city then anyway. Detroit’s North American International Auto Show is perhaps the most important of all such shows to industry leaders and the world press, attracting more than 5,000 international journalists despite the dubious attractions of a ruined and bankrupt city in the dead of winter. The NAIAS used to be held the first week in January until the world press rebelled, most members preferring to stay home with their families over the holidays, so now it has moved to the second full week in the month.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>One of the key reasons for non-specialist people to attend is not to see the new cars</strong> that you’ll be able to buy at a neighborhood dealership a day, week, or month after the show.

What appeals is to get a look at some of the dazzling “concept cars” that manufacturers confect for these events, unveiled at the very last instant. Those concepts are secret and—if you know how to look at them—significant. They can portend much about the future of specific companies and even the economies of entire countries.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"One of the many functions of a one-of-a-kind show car is to lead to acceptance of change.","type":"blockquote"},{"order":3,"text":"The automobile-related economy—manufacturing, selling, and servicing the cars themselves, plus the petroleum industry that is symbiotically tied to cars—is staggeringly gigantic, involving the investment and circulation trillions of dollars.

So a car that resonates with the public—as the first Ford Mustang did fifty years ago—can mean the fortunes of a massive enterprise can rise overnight. And one that doesn’t—Cadillac’s Cimarron, for example, or its botched diesel engine—can besmirch a firm’s reputation so badly that billions of dollars and dozens of years are needed to erase bad memories.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"The currently popular term for very special cars that are made by serious people with vast industry backing, i.e., mainstream manufacturers, may be “concept” cars, but other terms have been used in the past. At the absolute peak of American prosperity in the 1950s, such vehicles were known as “dream cars,” and they reflected an optimism and willingness to try anything so long as it could be seen as “progress.” General Motors became famous for its Motorama shows, staged in New York’s Waldorf-Astoria hotel ballroom. In low-rent-rate January, of course. Its multiple dreams, never fewer than one for each of the company’s five car divisions, were not really cars. For the most part, they didn’t even run, simply being Hollywood-style stage props, enormously heavy objects that had to be pushed or tugged into place.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"That still happens, of course, but most manufacturers now take pride in bringing vehicles to shows that do have real engines and can move—slowly and carefully, please—under their own power. Since cars, like birds and wild animals, can not really be fully assessed aesthetically until you see them in motion, wonderful films are made to be displayed on giant video screens behind the cars at shows. BMW went further at last fall’s Frankfurt Motor Show, with an indoor circuit encompassing hills and curves, allowing its new electric and hybrid cars to circulate all day long, taking chosen clients for exhilarating rides inside its pavilion.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<strong>Whenever you see someone’s new baby one of the first things you look for is visual signs of the parents.</strong> “Oh, he looks just like his father!” is a common cry, unless it’s “She’s the image of her mother.” This is a natural tendency that really applies to cars as well. Is there a perceptible family linkage? Can you see something of the object’s genetic heritage? You should, however subtle the traces, because one of the many functions of a one-of-a-kind show car is to lead to acceptance of change. Sometimes a company will have a clear plan to change a popular model, and to make that palatable for its clientele, a transitional “concept” model is actually made after the real car has been completely tooled and slated for introduction in a year or two. What it amounts to is having that future model face-lifted back to the past.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"how to look at a concept car","caption":"","fileMasterId":66974052,"fileName":"concept-corvette-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66974052/concept-corvette-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":7,"text":"<strong>Sixty-two years ago, General Motors decided to make a new sports car, the Chevrolet Corvette, with a revolutionary fiberglass-reinforced plastic body.</strong> It was shown at the Waldorf in January, and the first of 200 or so 1953 production models was sold in June.

Take Chrysler Corporation’s Viper, like the initial Corvette an almost Spartan two-seat sports model. Shown at the NAIAS in 1989, it was so popular that a decision to produce it was made after the show, and by 1992 it was available in the marketplace. That concept has now evolved through three generations (compared with the Corvette’s seven successive iterations).

If visibility seems poor, how did the designers deal with the problem? Many cars today have cameras that give you a nice view behind when you put the transmission in reverse. That’s an idea Buick proposed on a dream car half a century ago, and it has taken a long, long time to become accessible.

The Tesla of the Future</h3>\nThe slickest piece of car technology I saw at the Consumer Electronics Show was this future-looking prototype Tesla in the Delphi booth. There was a lot of talk this year about autonomous driving. But this was a hands-on demonstration of the future. Once cars are tricked out with sensors and autonomous driving features, the driver will be free to focus on other things. How will that change the interior of the car? This gorgeous design feat is an imagining of the interior of that car of the future. With cameras to detect if the driver is paying attention, a huge in-dash screen, the ability to change the appearance of the dash with a 3D NVIDIA display that renders a stunning new look digitally, a projector capable of displaying movies on the interior of the windshield, and a complete gaming system in the back seat, it is a future I want to see.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"Once cars are tricked out with sensors and autonomous driving features, the driver will be free to focus on other things.

Just drop your phone on a flat surface on the dash, and it will connect to your telematics system and charge your device wirelessly. In the back seat, perhaps you’ll find a larger mount for a tablet so the kids can watch a movie while charging their tablet. Inductive charging is already built into in many new smartphones.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Fast Women","id":1034957,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/fast-women","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-21T18:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"dakar-homepage","title":"women of the dakar rally","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60894650/dakar-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":60894650,"fileName":"dakar-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-21T18:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"dakar-01","title":"women of the dakar rally","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67422840/dakar-01.jpg","fileMasterId":67422840,"fileName":"dakar-01.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-21T18:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"dakar-homepage","title":"women of the dakar rally","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/60894650/dakar-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":60894650,"fileName":"dakar-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":601249,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>I was there when they departed before dawn on Sunday, January 5,</strong> steering through the throng of spectators who had stayed all night near Argentina’s national flag memorial to see them off.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-24T06:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"1-24-2014-homepage","title":"2014 chevrolet volt","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67520706/1-24-2014-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67520706,"fileName":"1-24-2014-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-24T06:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"1-24-2014-header","title":"2014 chevrolet volt","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61013048/1-24-2014-header.jpg","fileMasterId":61013048,"fileName":"1-24-2014-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-24T06:30:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"1-24-2014-homepage","title":"2014 chevrolet volt","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67520706/1-24-2014-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67520706,"fileName":"1-24-2014-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":597645,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>1.</strong> Just in case you want to <a href=\"http://www.loulavie.com/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">rent a Lamborghini in Miami</a>.

I like to interview them, learn about their lives, photograph them, and write their stories. The people at Jean Knows Cars noticed me through my project, Humans of Ann Arbor. In that project, I tool around the city of Ann Arbor, introducing myself to anyone who draws my eye. If they are open to it, I take a photo of them and hear a little bit about them. Then I post the photos and stories on Facebook. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/HumansofAnnArbor\" rel=\"”nofollow”\" target=\"”_blank”\">Humans  of Ann  Arbor</a>  has followers from all over the world who check in on a daily basis to see ordinary people and their extraordinary stories.\n\nI have been studying people since I was a little girl in Missouri. Where I grew up, studying people often led you to the cars they loved. My grandpa had a gas station in Claycomo, Missouri, which he opened in the 1950s, and he passed his love of cars and taking care of the people who drove them down to my dad. Dad was a mechanic and a service supervisor all his life. We had a steady barrage of cars coming into our lives…mostly Chevys. To impress my dad, I learned to identify every car I could, and I used to name the cars while we drove down the road. Car culture is big in Missouri. Would you believe that I had friends who were sisters named Nova and Chevelle? If\nyou didn’t grow up the way I did, you might not get the significance of that, but suffice it to say that my people love their cars.\n\nThe car I adored most was the Chevrolet Corvair my dad gave me when I was in high school. It spent more time in my dad's shop than it did on the road, but in those moments when it was drivable, I knew what it was to love a car. It was a thing of beauty: pale cream with a plaid madras interior. I loved the sound and feel of the engine…it was more like a soft purr than a roar. I can still remember how it smelled and what it was like to drive it with the windows rolled down on a warm day. I've had lots of cars since then, and I loved some of them, too. But the Corvair was my first car love and will always be my favorite.\n\nAfter high school, I drove my car to Springfield, Missouri, to study communications at Missouri State. Later, I drove a different car to Chicago to study photography at Columbia College. I worked in Chicago as a freelance photographer and studio manager for many years before moving to Ann Arbor, where I continue to do freelance photography. I am excited about combining my love of studying people with my interest in cars. I want to explore how cars serve us, how they are intertwined in our lives, and what makes us love them. I can't wait to let you know what I find out.","fileMasterId":66360111,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66360111/66360111.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-24T07:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"humans-homepage","title":"humans of the auto show","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61014785/humans-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61014785,"fileName":"humans-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-24T07:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"humans-header","title":"humans of the auto show","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67522122/humans-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67522122,"fileName":"humans-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":499}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-24T07:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"humans-homepage","title":"humans of the auto show","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61014785/humans-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61014785,"fileName":"humans-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":616276,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"I was so happy when Jean Knows Cars asked me to go to the North American International Auto Show and take a look around.

As a young adult I kicked around motor-racing, training to drive while I worked at a Brands Hatch satellite in Miami.  I've been race staff at the Detroit Grand Prix, worked TV coverage of Formula 1, Indy and NASCAR and done the occasional ride and drive program.  Eventually my racing aspirations gave way to a long held interest in filmmaking and I got my B.A. from the University of Michigan's burgeoning film program.  U of M taught me to write and introduced me to my excellent husband.  We spent five adventurous years in Los Angeles in the entertainment and publishing industries before returning to Ann Arbor where our lovely daughter came into the world.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Tech News","id":1034781,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/car-tech-news","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T08:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"biofore-homepage","title":"wood story","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65625616/biofore-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65625616,"fileName":"biofore-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T08:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"biofore-header","title":"wood story","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67661082/biofore-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67661082,"fileName":"biofore-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T08:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"biofore-homepage","title":"wood story","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/65625616/biofore-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":65625616,"fileName":"biofore-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":616946,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The cleverly named ConceptCar project is a joint initiative of the Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences and the bio and forest industry company UPM.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.)

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T10:22:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"bridgestone-homepage","title":"take care of your car","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61250051/bridgestone-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61250051,"fileName":"bridgestone-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T10:22:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"bridgestone-header","title":"take care of your car","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61250045/bridgestone-header.jpg","fileMasterId":61250045,"fileName":"bridgestone-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T10:22:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"bridgestone-homepage","title":"take care of your car","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61250051/bridgestone-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61250051,"fileName":"bridgestone-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":616710,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"At a recent Bridgestone Racing Academy event, Bridgestone employee Doug Niman went over some basics about the fluids in your car.

The next time I see someone holding their own teeth, though, I might lose it.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:12:43.457-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865963458 }} },{ "_id":474830,"title":"2015 Chrysler 200","subTitle":"Design chief Ralph Gilles and his team kept Chrysler's great history alive, and here's the payoff.","slug":"2015-chrysler-200","promoTitle":"2015 Chrysler 200","promoTeaserSmall":"Design chief Ralph Gilles and his team kept Chrysler's great history alive, and here's the payoff.","promoTeaser":"Design chief Ralph Gilles and his team kept Chrysler's great history alive, and here's the payoff.","keywords":["2015 Chrysler 200"],"metaTitle":"2015 Chrysler 200 - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["2015 Chrysler 200","Chrysler sedans","new Chrysler 200","Chrysler at Detroit Auto Show","Chrysler at North American International Auto Show","Chrysler design","Ralph Gilles"],"metaDescription":"2015 Chrysler 200: Designer walkaround with Ralph Gilles at the Detroit Auto Show.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Designer Walkaround","id":1034952,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-24T14:20:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chrysler-200-homepage","title":"2015 chrysler 200","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61051979/chrysler-200-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61051979,"fileName":"chrysler-200-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-24T14:20:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chrysler-200-header","title":"2015 chrysler 200","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61051853/chrysler-200-header.jpg","fileMasterId":61051853,"fileName":"chrysler-200-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-24T14:20:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chrysler-200-homepage","title":"2015 chrysler 200","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61051979/chrysler-200-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61051979,"fileName":"chrysler-200-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":616582,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Ralph Gilles has been an amazing constant at the head of Chrysler design.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Aftermarket","id":1034783,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/aftermarket-car-parts","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-30T10:48:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blizzerator-homepage","title":"its the blizzerator","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61472585/blizzerator-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61472585,"fileName":"blizzerator-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-30T10:48:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blizzerator-header","title":"its the blizzerator","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61472573/blizzerator-header.jpg","fileMasterId":61472573,"fileName":"blizzerator-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-30T10:48:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"blizzerator-homepage","title":"its the blizzerator","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61472585/blizzerator-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61472585,"fileName":"blizzerator-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":617119,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"its the blizzerator","caption":"","fileMasterId":66022597,"fileName":"blizz-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66022597/blizz-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>Timing is everything, and for the Blizzerator and me it was perfect.</strong> This triple threat to winter is an ice scraper, snow brush, and squeegee in one.

Putting your teenager in charge of a multi-thousand-pound vehicle may not be the easiest thing you’ve ever done, but it is almost inevitable. And the good news is that even when you’re not in the car with them, you can have a big impact on their driving habits, according to a study released this month by Travelers, the insurance provider. Keep reading for some surprising findings from the study, and tips on how to talk to your kids about safe driving.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>1. Be a Good Role Model</h3>\r\nTravelers found that teens who reported that their parents were good driving role models were half as likely to have been in an accident as teens whose parents weren’t setting a good example.

So when your kids are in the car, make an extra effort to drive safely and courteously–and hands off the cell phone.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>2. Start a Conversation. Soon.</h3>\nIn their survey of 2,000 teens and parents, Travelers found that two-thirds of sixteen-year-olds wanted to have a conversation about driving safety with their parents, and half of those kids were waiting for their parents to initiate the conversation. By the time young drivers are eighteen, however, that window of opportunity is nearly closed. Just 29 percent of surveyed eighteen-year-olds were interested in a safe-driving talk with their parents. Don’t shy away from the talk; start a dialogue with your kids before they lose interest.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"Be sure that your kids know not only how dangerous it is to drink or text behind the wheel, but feel empowered to refuse rides from peers who aren’t driving safely.","type":"blockquote"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>3.

While the majority of teens–66 percent–were concerned about driving under the influence, just 14 percent of parents thought of it as a major concern. Mobile phone use while driving concerned 56 percent of teenagers but just 35 percent of parents, despite heavy media coverage of the dangers of distracted driving. You may not be worried about these behaviors because you think your teen knows better than to engage in them, but you should include impaired and distracted driving in your safe-driving talk anyway. Be sure that your kids know not only how dangerous it is to drink or text behind the wheel, but that they feel empowered to refuse rides from peers who aren’t driving safely.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>4. Make a Driving Contract</h3>  \r\nActing as a good driving role model and having a frank, open conversation with your teens about safe driving will go a long way, but they can’t be your last steps.

Talk about forbidden behaviors, curfews, the number of passengers they’re allowed to carry, and anything else that’s important to you.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>5. Have Consequences and Stick to Them</h3>\nYou should also agree on consequences for broken rules, so the contract has some teeth.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Road Trips","id":1034777,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-road-trips","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-30T14:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"bentley-homepage","title":"what i drove 1 30","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67768803/bentley-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67768803,"fileName":"bentley-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-30T14:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"bentley-header","title":"what i drove 1 30","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67768782/bentley-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67768782,"fileName":"bentley-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-30T14:18:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"bentley-homepage","title":"what i drove 1 30","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67768803/bentley-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67768803,"fileName":"bentley-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":617264,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>I continue to not drive anything due to the big walking boot on my right ankle,</strong> which was broken at the Detroit Auto Show.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-31T08:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup-homepage","title":"weekly windup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61551317/windup-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61551317,"fileName":"windup-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-31T08:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup-header","title":"weekly windup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66111886/windup-header.jpg","fileMasterId":66111886,"fileName":"windup-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":412},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":648}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-31T08:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"windup-homepage","title":"weekly windup","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61551317/windup-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":61551317,"fileName":"windup-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":617365,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>1.</strong> If you were asleep this week and missed the woes of our friends in Atlanta, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/atlanta-traffic-jam-pictures-2014-1?utm_source=slate&utm_medium=referral&utm_term=partner\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here is a quick recap</a>.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>2.</strong> And for those of you who are snickering, perhaps <a href=\"http://www.weather.com/news/weather-winter/winter-storm-maximus-forecast-california-rockies-midwest-northeast-snow-ice-20140129\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maximus will kick you</a> in your karma.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>3.</strong> Wikihow has <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Survive-Being-Trapped-in-Your-Car-During-a-Snowstorm\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">some tips if you are ever trapped in your car</a> in a snowstorm.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"4.

It was quiet inside, navigated the bumps and unevenness of winter roads with aplomb, and generally felt much more expensive and more powerful than it actually is.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

You can also enjoy how long you can go without pulling into a gas station. It's got all the safety and technology features you would want on a new sedan, plus it will save you a bunch of money on fuel. According to Chevrolet, the average user fills up the tank once a month and saves $900 a year on fuel costs.

And, with the new price reduction, if you get the maximum $7,500 tax credit, you're talking about a starting price around $28,000, just about where you'd be for a traditionally powered sedan.<br>\n<br>\nGive this car a try.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-2-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664358/insurance-2-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67664358,"fileName":"insurance-2-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-2-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664358/insurance-2-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67664358,"fileName":"insurance-2-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-2-header","title":"insurance tip no 2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664355/insurance-2-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67664355,"fileName":"insurance-2-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:49:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-2-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664358/insurance-2-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67664358,"fileName":"insurance-2-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":616266,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Most consumers tend to approach auto insurance with an eye to the vehicle insured. What’s the deductible? Would my repairs be covered in the event of an accident?  There are, however, four components to insurance. The first two involve the vehicle, of course, but the second two help <em>you</em> by protecting you financially. My agent, Nathan Lamb, whom you may have met in last week's <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-driving-tips/insurance-checkup-time/ \" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Insurance Checkup Time</a>, explained it all this way. <em>It's important to note that I live in Michigan, one of twelve states with \"no fault\" laws governing the way auto coverage works. The laws in your state and therefore, the insurance coverage, may be different.</em>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>1. Collision Coverage</h3>\r\nCollision insurance, as its name implies, covers you if you hit something. If you’re at fault, your rating will be affected, likely making future coverage more expensive. The type of collision coverage you chose will depend on a variety of factors, including the age of the car and your tolerance for risk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n In Michigan, a “no fault” state (offerings vary state by state), there are three types of collision coverage.<br>\r\n<ul><strong>1. Regular collision</strong> pays for damage to your car from an accident. Regardless of who is at fault, you are responsible for the deductible.<br>\r\n<strong>2. Broad collision</strong> also pays for damage to your car from an accident. It absolves you of paying the deductible if you are not more than 50 percent at fault.<br>\r\n<strong>3. Limited collision</strong> coverage says that, if you’re at fault, the policy won't cover you at all; if the other party is at fault, your insurance covers the damage, although you still have to pay the deductible.</ul>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>2. Comprehensive Coverage</h3>\"Comprehensive\" insurance covers acts of God, things like hail damage, a tree falling on your car, or a deer trying to jump in for a ride. It will trigger payment of a deductible, as our recent story on a <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-maintenance/car-insurance-fail/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">flying-tire incident</a> unfortunately highlighted.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"Check your liability.

Property Protection (PPI)</h3> Property protection insurance covers damage to other people's property. Say you blow a tire driving down Main Street, lose control, and hit someone’s front porch. That’s when property damage coverage comes into play.  In Michigan, the state minimum is $10,000; most insurers recommend coverage for $1 million.The increase in coverage generally costs only a couple of dollars a month, and, think about it, $10,000 doesn’t cover you for much if you’ve inadvertently done structural damage to the house when you \"parked\" on the porch.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>4. Residual Liability</h3> This coverage, known as Residual Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability insurance, covers you if you are found responsible or get sued as the result of an accident. In Michigan, the state minimum follows the 20/40 rule; you must have coverage for $20,000 per person and up to $40,000 per accident. Such minimal coverage, however, does not protect you from what Nathan calls “the Worst Day” event.  Black ice prevents you from stopping at an intersection and when you slide through, you hit a car with four occupants, causing injury, or God forbid, death.  You are at fault; they sue and win a $250,000 judgment per passenger. You are now responsible for $1 million.  Under 20/40, which may have seemed the best option because of the minimal monthly premium, you are covered for only $40,000. The other $960,000? Your responsibility, and you could work for rest of your life, with 25 percent of your wages garnished, until you have settled that debt.  Check your liability. No one likes to think about the Worst Day, but it is, in fact, that day for which you really have insurance coverage.,","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<em>\nImage at top from SarapulSar38/iStock/Thinkstock</em>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h3>Related stories:</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-driving-tips/insurance-checkup-time/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Insurance Checkup Time</a> - January 29, 2014<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/cool-tech/car-apps/wreckcheck-smartphone-app/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">A Smartphone App for Insurance Claims</a> - June 27, 2013<br>","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:12:49.740-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865969741 }} },{ "_id":475993,"title":"Inside the Audi Allroad Concept","subTitle":"","slug":"inside-the-audi-allroad-concept","promoTitle":"Inside the Audi Allroad Concept","promoTeaserSmall":"Interior design chief Enzo Rothfuss shows me a groundbreaking interior that's bound for the 2015 TT.","promoTeaser":"Interior design chief Enzo Rothfuss shows me a groundbreaking interior that's bound for the 2015 TT.","keywords":["Inside the Audi Allroad Concept"],"metaTitle":"Inside the Audi Allroad Concept - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Audi Allroad Shooting Brake","Audi concept","Audi at Detroit Auto Show","Audi at North American International Auto Show","2015 Audi TT"],"metaDescription":"Inside the Audi Allroad Concept:","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2014-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2014-02-06T14:09:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2014-02-04T14:09:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":false,"url":"/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround/inside-the-audi-allroad-concept/","canBeGallery":false,"contributors":[{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Alt Fuel","id":1034784,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/car-alt-fuel","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-06T09:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"kia-soul-ev-flipper","title":"Kia Soul EV","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61844312/Kia-Soul-EV-Flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":61844312,"fileName":"Kia-Soul-EV-Flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-06T09:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"soul-header","title":"Soul Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66519973/Soul-Header.jpg","fileMasterId":66519973,"fileName":"Soul-Header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-06T10:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"soul-ev-flipper","title":"Soul EV Flipper","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61849520/Soul-EV-Flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":61849520,"fileName":"Soul-EV-Flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}}},"pages":[{"id":618113,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Chicagoas","caption":"","fileMasterId":66531421,"fileName":"chicagoas.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66531421/chicagoas.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":396},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"order":0,"text":"We were just talking about the <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/2014-kia-soul/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Kia Soul</a> at Jean Knows Cars, and days after our review of the 2014 model, the automaker has rolled out a new version.

Drivers can also dial in the car's regenerative braking system to recapture up to 12 percent of energy during coasting and braking, which will help optimize that range. I  liked Kia's choice of where to plug it in: right behind the front grille. It will charge in four to five hours using a 240-volt charging station or in 24 hours with standard 120-volt household current.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"New Car Features","id":1034782,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/new-car-features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-06T13:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"versa-note-flipper","title":"Versa Note Flipper","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61862084/Versa-Note-Flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":61862084,"fileName":"Versa-Note-Flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-06T13:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chicagoas31","title":"Chicagoas31","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61862072/chicagoas31.jpg","fileMasterId":61862072,"fileName":"chicagoas31.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":3130},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":4928}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-06T13:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"versa-note-flipper","title":"Versa Note Flipper","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61862084/Versa-Note-Flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":61862084,"fileName":"Versa-Note-Flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":649}}},"pages":[{"id":618112,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Chicagoas61","caption":"","fileMasterId":61862051,"fileName":"chicagoas61.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61862051/chicagoas61.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":2873},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":4523}},"order":0,"text":"Nissan rolled out a new version of its entry-level hatchback, the Versa Note, at the Chicago Auto Show today, and here it is.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.) Automobiles, functional objects that often shape image, are fundamental elements of today’s society.  This would be another mode of cultural analysis and critique.  Couched in that light, it made perfect sense!\n\n(And, I really can whistle like a trucker, but louder. I may be an art historian, but don’t sit next to me at a hockey rink.)","fileMasterId":40331497,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40331497/40331497.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-3-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 3","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664472/insurance-3-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67664472,"fileName":"insurance-3-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-3-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 3","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664472/insurance-3-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67664472,"fileName":"insurance-3-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-3-header","title":"insurance tip no 3","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664469/insurance-3-header.jpg","fileMasterId":67664469,"fileName":"insurance-3-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-01-28T09:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-3-homepage","title":"insurance tip no 3","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/67664472/insurance-3-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":67664472,"fileName":"insurance-3-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":616267,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Most people assume that car insurance protects a depreciating asset (the vehicle).

I like to interview them, learn about their lives, photograph them, and write their stories. The people at Jean Knows Cars noticed me through my project, Humans of Ann Arbor. In that project, I tool around the city of Ann Arbor, introducing myself to anyone who draws my eye. If they are open to it, I take a photo of them and hear a little bit about them. Then I post the photos and stories on Facebook. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/HumansofAnnArbor\" rel=\"”nofollow”\" target=\"”_blank”\">Humans  of Ann  Arbor</a>  has followers from all over the world who check in on a daily basis to see ordinary people and their extraordinary stories.\n\nI have been studying people since I was a little girl in Missouri. Where I grew up, studying people often led you to the cars they loved. My grandpa had a gas station in Claycomo, Missouri, which he opened in the 1950s, and he passed his love of cars and taking care of the people who drove them down to my dad. Dad was a mechanic and a service supervisor all his life. We had a steady barrage of cars coming into our lives…mostly Chevys. To impress my dad, I learned to identify every car I could, and I used to name the cars while we drove down the road. Car culture is big in Missouri. Would you believe that I had friends who were sisters named Nova and Chevelle? If\nyou didn’t grow up the way I did, you might not get the significance of that, but suffice it to say that my people love their cars.\n\nThe car I adored most was the Chevrolet Corvair my dad gave me when I was in high school. It spent more time in my dad's shop than it did on the road, but in those moments when it was drivable, I knew what it was to love a car. It was a thing of beauty: pale cream with a plaid madras interior. I loved the sound and feel of the engine…it was more like a soft purr than a roar. I can still remember how it smelled and what it was like to drive it with the windows rolled down on a warm day. I've had lots of cars since then, and I loved some of them, too. But the Corvair was my first car love and will always be my favorite.\n\nAfter high school, I drove my car to Springfield, Missouri, to study communications at Missouri State. Later, I drove a different car to Chicago to study photography at Columbia College. I worked in Chicago as a freelance photographer and studio manager for many years before moving to Ann Arbor, where I continue to do freelance photography. I am excited about combining my love of studying people with my interest in cars. I want to explore how cars serve us, how they are intertwined in our lives, and what makes us love them. I can't wait to let you know what I find out.","fileMasterId":66360111,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/66360111/66360111.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Mix","id":1034790,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/the-mix","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-10T12:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pinball-homepage","title":"ford pinball game","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68341107/pinball-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68341107,"fileName":"pinball-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-10T12:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pinball-header","title":"ford pinball game","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/61997747/pinball-header.jpg","fileMasterId":61997747,"fileName":"pinball-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":397},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":625}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2014-02-10T12:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pinball-homepage","title":"ford pinball game","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/68341107/pinball-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":68341107,"fileName":"pinball-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":635712,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Don’t tell my kid, but before the term “screen time” was coined I spent a huge chunk of my\nchildhood playing video games and pinball in my neighborhood arcade.
