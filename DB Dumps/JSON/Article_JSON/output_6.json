I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Driving Tips","id":1034956,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-driving-tips","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Safety ","id":1023754,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/car-safety","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-22T14:04:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Land Rover LR2 Snow","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48526014/Land-Rover-LR2-300.jpg","fileMasterId":48526014,"fileName":"Land-Rover-LR2-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-22T14:04:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Land Rover LR2 Snow","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43713695/Land-Rover-LR2.jpg","fileMasterId":43713695,"fileName":"Land-Rover-LR2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":620}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-22T14:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Land Rover LR2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43297840/Flipper-with-car-3.jpg","fileMasterId":43297840,"fileName":"Flipper-with-car-3.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":979}}},"pages":[{"id":456244,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Land Rover in Snow","caption":"At 8 a.m., the country road I live on was still waiting for the county plow.","fileMasterId":48525153,"fileName":"Street_View.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48525153/Street_View.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":0,"text":"If I looked at a weather report more often, I wouldn’t be surprised like I was this morning by the fairly heavy snowfall.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Soapbox","id":1034787,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/soapbox","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[{"articleId":337020,"name":"article0","promoImage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-17T17:54:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Danica Patrick","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43603220/Danica-300.jpg","fileMasterId":43603220,"fileName":"Danica-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"promoTeaser":"Danica Patrick will be the first woman to start a race from the pole in NASCAR Sprint Cup history.","title":"Fast Women: Patrick Makes History","url":"/you-auto-know/fast-women/fast-women-danica-patrick/"}],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-25T12:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Danica Patrick","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48572796/Danica-300.jpg","fileMasterId":48572796,"fileName":"Danica-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-25T11:00:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Danica Patrick","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43355545/Danica-02.jpg","fileMasterId":43355545,"fileName":"Danica-02.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-25T11:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Danica Patrick","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43769591/Danica-Patrick-.jpg","fileMasterId":43769591,"fileName":"Danica-Patrick-.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":978}}},"pages":[{"id":456276,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"left","altText":"Danica Patrick","caption":"","fileMasterId":43355542,"fileName":"Danica_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43355542/Danica_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":0,"text":"The Daytona 500 is over, and Danica Patrick delivered, underscoring the <a href=http://www.jeanknowscars.com/features/style/fast-women-danica-patrick/ target=\"_blank\">historic achievement</a> of being the first woman to win the pole for NASCAR’s most important race.

She’s used to the fawning and the flubbing. After winning the pole, she handled the immense pressure with grace. And how she raced did nothing to make Jeff Gordon’s five-year-old daughter, Ella, regret her request for a photo with the fastest qualifier.

But with 240 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque in the diesel model, you’ll still have plenty of power to smoke the competition off red lights. Audi is also launching TDI incarnations of the A6, A7, and Q5 in the fall of 2013.  Pricing and fuel economy haven’t been announced for those models yet.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>BMW</h3>\nBMW doesn’t offer quite the complement of diesel vehicles that some of its German competitors manage.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Fast Women","id":1034957,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/fast-women","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-04T11:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Notorius Women","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43486084/Benz-Promolarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":43486084,"fileName":"Benz-Promolarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-04T11:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Notorius Women","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43485973/Bertha-Header.jpg","fileMasterId":43485973,"fileName":"Bertha-Header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-04T11:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Notorius Women","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43914257/Bertha-Flipper.jpg","fileMasterId":43914257,"fileName":"Bertha-Flipper.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":456800,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"What makes a woman crazy about an automobile?

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

In Salt Lake City, I tested snow tires against all-season tires, and the results were pretty astounding.

Don’t Overdo It</h4>\nThis is good advice all year long, but I realized just how essential it is in snow while driving on the test course. As we were preparing for the collision avoidance maneuver, instructor Jason Smith warned us that when turning in the snow, the car’s response to steering input would be slower than normal. If you’re trying to make a turn in snowy weather and don’t feel the car respond, “don’t start turning the wheel more.” Instead, wait until the tires grip and the car starts responding, then see where you’re headed and correct from there. Otherwise, you could find yourself turning too sharply once the car gets traction.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"We were also advised to avoid giant, sweeping movements, which can be hard to correct on the snow’s slippery surface. (That’s not exactly shocking, but it’s important to keep it in mind, because you have to think and act differently when roads are covered with snow.) When you’re driving in the snow, don’t panic if your car takes a little longer to respond than it would in perfect conditions. Overcorrecting could leave you with an even bigger problem, so wait until you know where the car is headed before you change the way you’re turning the wheel.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"5-ways-to-drive-better-in-snow","caption":"An Infiniti G37x contends with the hill climb portion of the course.","fileMasterId":44035583,"fileName":"wintertires_02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44035583/wintertires_02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"order":6,"text":"<h4>3.

My take-home advice was that you must achieve a steady, balanced amount of power to make it up the hill.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"5-ways-to-drive-better-in-snow","caption":"An Infiniti G37x fitted with snow tires crests the hill during the hill climb.

Then keep the power steady until you’re up and over. Easing off the gas will rob you of the momentum you need to counteract gravity as it tries to pull your car down the hill. Conversely, giving the car too much gas could leave your wheels spinning and you sliding backward.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"If you do find yourself making a return journey down a hill, don’t panic. Keep your foot on the brake, and try to guide your car down in a straight line. Then give yourself a little room to accelerate and try again, avoiding ruts and rough patches that other cars have carved in the snow.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<h4>4. Slow and Steady Wins</h4>\nEven when you’re not driving up a steep hill or a twisting mountain road, you shouldn’t be trying to win any races when the weather is bad. Controlling a car on a slick surface can get difficult pretty quickly. You’re more likely to slide going around corners, and since it takes time for a car to react to steering and braking input in bad weather, you may not be able to avoid a collision in time if you’re moving along at your normal cruising speed.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"Maybe you feel comfortable at 60 mph in a snowstorm, but if your car can’t come to a halt in time in case of emergency, you’re not driving safely. Make sure you stay within your limits and the car’s during bouts of bad weather.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<h4>5. Smooth Is Fast</h4>\nIt’s not a lot to grab on to, but perhaps the advice most often repeated during my snowy day at the track was simply to be smooth. Accelerate smoothly, steer smoothly, brake—okay, braking doesn’t necessarily need to be smooth. Sometimes you need that full ABS stop to avoid the hypothetical kid running out into the street.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"But accelerating gradually is key. It helps avoid the dreaded tire spin that can get you stuck in a snowdrift or leave you at a standstill at a green light. Put slow, steady pressure on the gas pedal, and you should be able to maintain traction and get moving. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"Steering smoothly is also essential. Avoiding broad, erratic steering movements can help you stay in control. Try to be direct and consistent when you turn the wheel. One instructor said this is just good advice for driving in general. \"Smooth is fast.\" That’s advice I’ll keep in mind long after the snow finally melts.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"Gearing up for the acceleration and braking test.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.)

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I really don't. The freedom of getting behind the wheel of a car and just taking off can't be compared with anything else. You really feel that you’re in charge: in charge of the car, in charge of the road, and in charge of your life. Why on earth would you want someone else to drive you around when you could do it yourself? It’s so liberating! Obviously, I love driving. I suppose that isn't a particularly original statement for a Detroit native, but it's true. I was a little late getting my driver's license because of that pesky parallel parking, but once I got it, nothing could stop me. It doesn't matter if I have to chauffeur my grandmother to the bank less than a block from our house or drive across town. If I have my green Chrysler LHS--affectionately christened \"Betsy\" by my mother--and some gas in the tank, and if I am somehow able to avoid getting pulled over for driving just a little too fast, I'm good to go.\n\nSince I graduated from the University of Michigan, in April 2012, Betsy has taken me everywhere. She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn’t as dry as a piece of chalk…And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there.

The company employs certified technicians who receive ongoing training in customer service practices, working with new vehicle materials and technologies like carbon fiber and waterborne paint, and using new repair processes.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Maintenance & Service Center","id":1023755,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-13T13:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"jamie-little-book-review","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43651384/little-promolarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":43651384,"fileName":"little-promolarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-13T12:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"jamie-little-book-review","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44196146/Little-header.jpg","fileMasterId":44196146,"fileName":"Little-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-13T12:39:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"jamie-little-book-review","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44196149/little-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":44196149,"fileName":"little-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":457845,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"jamie-little-book-review","caption":"","fileMasterId":43652041,"fileName":"Little_04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43652041/Little_04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":0,"text":"On a rainy Friday night in Las Vegas, Jamie Little sits at a table in a casino's sports bar,  where buckets are catching drips from the roof.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Teenagers","id":1034773,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/kids-in-the-car/teenagers","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Safety ","id":1023754,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/car-safety","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Kids in the Car","id":1034769,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-15T06:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"license-to-freak-out-mom","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43683529/Promolarge2.jpg","fileMasterId":43683529,"fileName":"Promolarge2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-15T06:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"license-to-freak-out-mom","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48968751/Header2.jpg","fileMasterId":48968751,"fileName":"Header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-03-15T06:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"license-to-freak-out-mom","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43683526/homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":43683526,"fileName":"homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":458077,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"license-to-freak-out-mom","caption":"","fileMasterId":44246429,"fileName":"elle_01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/44246429/elle_01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":0,"text":"The sweet six-year-old girl that you see in this photo is now sixteen and is counting down the days until she can drive without any supervision.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I like it when everybody can have a snack when they want one, which cuts way down on crankiness. On road trips, I supplement by letting them get sunflower seeds, soda, chips, and Sour Patch Kids at gas stations. I am also perfectly willing to live off drive-through food for short periods.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Spain's drivers were least likely to text and drive, with just fifteen percent of those surveyed saying they had done so in the past month.

It's a hybrid designed for city driving that pairs a gasoline engine with a hydraulic motor powered by compressed nitrogen. The nitrogen is stored in a tank under the car, and when the driver decelerates or brakes, that action causes it to compress. The kinetic energy stored in the compressed nitrogen can then be used to power the car for up to 80 percent of city driving, depending on the traffic. More traffic, and thus more braking, will allow the car to be powered by nitrogen, or basically to run on air, for a greater percentage of a trip. Peugeot says this technology could get the car to as much as 81 mpg in the city, where its regenerative braking capability would be most useful.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Peugeot's Hybrid Air system is experimental for now, but the company hopes to have the technology in European showrooms by 2015 or 2016.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

When she went to the theater, she bought two seats (one for herself and one for her purse).

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Then, in 1929, she entered and won the all-women's Grand Prix at Montlhery, France, driving a French Omega Six racing car. That was only a prelude to several years of competition in mainstream racing against male competitors. She toured U.S. racetracks in a Miller in 1930 and raced a Bugatti Type 35C and an Alfa Romeo 8C Monza in Grands Prix all over Europe in the years before the outbreak of World War II.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Future buyers will pay just $99 for that package, which includes remote control of door locks, geofencing, speed alerts (especially of interest if you have a household with teen drivers), and voice text messaging capability.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>Another Consumer-Friendly Move from Hyundai</h4> Launched during the depths of the recession, Hyundai Assurance started with a buyback program that allowed customers who lost their jobs within one year of purchasing a new Hyundai to return the car and end their loan obligation.

It's not exactly invisible (the collar's outer shell will be available in a variety of colors and designs), but close enough. The collar contains an airbag and sensors that detect when the wearer is in a crash, as well as a black box to record data about crashes. When the sensors detect a crash, they trigger a gas inflator that causes the airbag to inflate rapidly to form a cocoon of protection around the wearer's cranium.

Punk rockers beware: you can't use Hovding with heavy dreads, a stiff mohawk, or large hoop earrings.

She married Erik Carlsson, one of the most famous rally drivers of the day. She met him while she was rallying, but she didn't begin as a racing driver.

So while she was upside down in the car, she was carefully removing the set screws that held the window in place. She was just about to remove the final screw when Eric came around the corner, saw her upside down, jumped out of his car in a panic, and ran to the car and kicked the window in.

After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Maintenance & Service Center","id":1023755,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-02T15:50:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"money-to-buy-a-car-step-two","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/49397382/Finance-2-Promo-copy.png","fileMasterId":49397382,"fileName":"Finance-2-Promo-copy.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-02T15:50:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"money-to-buy-a-car-step-two","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/49397391/Finance2-header.png","fileMasterId":49397391,"fileName":"Finance2-header.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-02T15:50:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"money-to-buy-a-car-step-two","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/49397415/finance2-homepage-copy.png","fileMasterId":49397415,"fileName":"finance2-homepage-copy.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":460925,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Researching and picking out a new car are exhilarating, but the buying process can be daunting.

Skiba warns against assuming that promotional deals (like the popular zero percent APR) are always the best choice. He says that a special interest rate often takes the place of a rebate. He gives a recent example of a 2012 Mazda 3: \"We can sell [this car] with $2,259 off sticker price in lieu of special interest,\" he says, \"but if they want the special rate, it adds $1,400\" to the price advertised on the dealership's website. Buyers who take the special interest rate will still pay less than the sticker price, but they'll pay about $1,400 more than a buyer who finances at a normal rate instead of the promotional rate. In this case, customers who opt for zero percent financing would also have to choose a thirty-six-month loan, forgoing the chance to take longer to pay off the car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"For Skiba, it all comes down to numbers. \"If you do the math, it might make more sense to do the cheaper price\" instead of the zero percent deal.

Cars are expensive, and there’s a general feeling that the odds of getting a good deal are stacked against the buyer. Huddy Skiba, sales manager at Hyman Bros.

If you take <em>Consumer Reports</em>’ advice, you should spend no more than 36 percent of your gross income on debt. This includes a mortgage (or your monthly rent, if you don’t own your home), credit card bills, and any other monthly payments. To determine what you can afford to pay for a car, add up all your monthly expenses and subtract that number from the 36 percent you can spend on debt. What’s left over is what you have to spare for a car payment.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>How Much Do You Plan to Spend?</h4> For example: the median household income in the United States is just under $53,000. Using our 36 percent benchmark, that household can spend about $19,000 per year on debt payments, or about $1,600 per month. Just for the sake of round numbers, if you have a $600 housing payment and another $400 in other debt, you’re left with $600 for new debt, like a car payment.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Bankrate.com, a personal finance site, has a different rule of thumb. They suggest that you spend no more than twenty percent of your monthly income on your car, which includes payments for insurance, car maintenance, and other operating costs. This means that a household earning $53,000 (about $4,400 per month pretax) should spend no more than $880 per month on car-related expenses. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h4>What About the Down Payment?</h4> Deciding on the size of your down payment is also important. Skiba says that these days, since many dealers no longer require a down payment as part of a new-car purchase, \"nobody’s putting any money down. You don’t have to.\" Putting little or no money down might make it easier to afford a car, since you won’t have to plop down a large lump sum before you get the keys, but it can also mean that you owe more than the car is worth almost immediately, since the value of a new car depreciates quickly once it leaves the dealer lot. It might be hard to come up with a sizable down payment, but it will lower your monthly payments and allow you to borrow less money to finance your purchase.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"Also consider operating costs (gas and maintenance) and how much it will cost to insure a vehicle. You’re going to spend more to insure a sports car than a minivan and more to fill up a large SUV than a compact car. Once you have an idea of how much you can afford to pay each month and settle on an amount for the down payment, you can use an online calculator to determine what the total value of your new car should be. Make sure the whole picture fits into your budget.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"Check back tomorrow for our final installment on financing, when we’ll talk about how to decide on the length of your loan.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:07:45.082-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865665083 }} },{ "_id":341059,"title":"The Amelia Island Concours on Video","subTitle":"","slug":"amelia-island-video","promoTitle":"The Amelia Island Concours on Video","promoTeaserSmall":"Where I go in March to find the best collectible cars and the best people.","promoTeaser":"Where I go in March to find the best collectible cars and the best people.","keywords":["Amelia Island Video"],"metaTitle":"The Amelia Island Concours on Video - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance","Amelia Island","Concours d'Elegance","collector cars","Ritz-Carlton","vintage cars"],"metaDescription":"The Amelia Island Concours on Video.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Cars are expensive, and there’s a general feeling that the odds of getting a good deal are stacked against the buyer. Huddy Skiba, sales manager at Hyman Bros.

We’re just trying to help.\"","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"We want to help, too, so we’ve put together a few pieces of advice to help unravel the mysteries of shopping for your new car.

Naturally, shorter loans will have higher monthly payments but they'll also accrue less interest, so you’ll pay less overall by the time the loan is paid off. On the other hand, longer loans and lower monthly payments may be crucial to fitting a car into your budget. Even a seventy-two-month loan has become relatively common in these days of high car prices.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"What should really determine loan length is how long you plan to keep your car. Signing a five-year loan with low monthly payments may seem like a good idea, but if you’re planning on dumping your car for a newer model after two years, you’ll still have a large balance when you start shopping for a car again.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h4>Don't Let Yourself Go Upside Down</h4>\nThe key is to avoid owing more money than the car is worth. This is more likely to happen if you have a long loan and a high interest rate and make a small down payment because your vehicle’s value may depreciate faster than you can pay off the principal on your loan. This could cause problems if your insurance provider won’t cover the car for as much as you owe, or if you are looking to trade your car in and can’t negotiate a value that allows you to pay off your existing loan.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>The Moment of Truth: Heading into the Dealership</h4>\nWe’ve said this <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/videos/qa/new-car-state-of-mind/\" title=\"\"  target=\"_blank\">before</a>, but it bears repeating: if you did all your homework, made all your decisions, and you still can’t come to a reasonable agreement with your dealer, walk out. Buying a car is a big investment and not one that you should be pressured into. Take all the time you need to get a deal you feel comfortable with, and if you don’t think you can reach a deal with the salesperson you’re working with, ask for a different salesperson or find yourself a new dealer.  There’s no reason to be nervous, though. Skiba believes that buyers who have done their homework and walk into the dealership armed with plenty of information have every reason to expect a good deal.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"There’s a lot more to say about the process of buying a car.

I live with two car buffs, Lee Quiñones and our four-year-old son, who both think what I do is pretty cool.","fileMasterId":39801671,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801671/39801671.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,10009,6202044,6202090]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-09T13:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"http://www.driversedguru.com/driving-articles/car-driving-skills/how-to-parallel-park/","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45095575/Lexusin-the-city-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":45095575,"fileName":"Lexusin-the-city-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-09T13:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"http://www.driversedguru.com/driving-articles/car-driving-skills/how-to-parallel-park/","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45647309/Lexusinthe-city-header.jpg","fileMasterId":45647309,"fileName":"Lexusinthe-city-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-09T13:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"http://www.driversedguru.com/driving-articles/car-driving-skills/how-to-parallel-park/","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45647306/lexusin-the-city-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":45647306,"fileName":"lexusin-the-city-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":461329,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"I live in New York City, where subways and walking are the preferred form of mobility and how I like to get around the most.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

It was charmingly known as the Rand McNally Auto Chum, and it had no Interstate highways on it; there weren't any yet (not until the 1950s).","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"road-atlas-joins-21st-century","caption":"","fileMasterId":51806760,"fileName":"Rand_03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/51806760/Rand_03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":4,"text":"The coolest thing about the Auto Chum (besides the name, of course) is that it was organized geographically from east to west, starting with Maine.

For that reason, I asked our editors to come up with their top three rules when they’re setting off on a road trip. And here they are, starting with my own. You'll notice that we have very different styles of packing for a trip. Which JKC editor are you?","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>Laura Sky Brown: Same Hippie, Different Decade</h3>\nI have gone on many extended road trips. The first one, at age eighteen, when I didn’t even have my driver’s license yet, was an extended five-week journey all over the country. Stuffed into a Chevrolet Vega with a teenage friend and her large dog—so, with barely enough room to sit, let alone bring stuff—we traveled from Michigan to Washington State, then from Washington to western Massachusetts, by way of the Grand Canyon and nearly every other place in between. Some things have changed: back in those days, I didn’t much care whether I changed clothes every day or not, but I do now. Nevertheless, that trip taught me to pack light and learn to like it. Here are my rules for a road trip.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>Rule #1: Pack light.</strong> No, lighter than that. If you can’t carry it yourself, don’t bring it.  Unless you are going off-road in the Yukon, there are stores out there that sell most of what you might need beyond the basics. I even like to pack cheap or worn-out socks and T-shirts that I can discard when they’re dirty, making room for things I have acquired on the road. So you’re out in Utah without the exact headband or conditioner you would use at home! Who cares? You also won’t have to spend any time sorting, classifying, and packing and repacking those things. Having a light load frees you up both mentally and physically.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<strong>Rule #2: Know what you want to eat, and have it with you in the car.</strong> Otherwise, you end up at gas station shops buying Pringles when you really should have had  bananas and nonfat yogurt.

We stopped at rest stops and jumped around, got drinks, went to the bathroom then off on the road again.

I did the navigation, Alice fed me cheesy Combos, and I handed Hayley our classic childhood snack, Gushers. Five hours later, we hit the dock. It was time to park our mini house of snacks and luggage and take the ferry boat off to the world where no cars are allowed. After the long weekend, we headed back to Ann Arbor.

A normal passenger who is able to drive should stop reaching for his footbrake after five minutes.

A lot of people start showing off as soon as they know you are a competition driver. They want to prove that they could have been world champions if they had been given the chance, so they go wild and take terrible risks…One of the worst examples was in America when a taxi-driver recognized us and started driving like mad over a wet, slippery road. Suddenly the car went broadside and for some strange reason both the rear doors flew open. We cowered in the back clutching at the seats and at each other to keep from falling out as the taxi went sideways down the street. The driver had his own way of dealing with the situation. He put all the blame on the cab and shouted at it: ‘Now then, Rosemary! That’s no way to behave.’ ”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"\r\n<h3>On Being Physically Comfortable in the Car</h3>\r\n“You should try to be physically relaxed while driving, and it is quite possible to do this while remaining mentally alert…We both have some experience of racing as well as rallying, and we can assure you that a racing driver who was physically tense and who clutched at the wheel would not have the sensitivity to drive the car fast round corners. The heart of a surgeon during a difficult operation probably beats as fast as the heart of a racing driver during a difficult race, but no one has ever suggested that a surgeon should hold his scalpel in the tight, feelingless grip of a boy whittling a stick. Good surgery and good driving both need a light sensitive touch.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h3>On Reading the Road</h3>\n\"Anticipation is one of the most valuable assets for good driving. The classic example was something which happened during the Monaco Grand Prix race in 1950. This race is run through the streets of Monte Carlo, and it was won that year by [Juan Manuel] Fangio, one of the best racing drivers of all time…He was roaring around the circuit in his Alfa Romeo and as he approached a tricky corner he suddenly noticed that there was something different about the crowd. It did not look the same as usual. There was not the normal whitish blur of faces.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"“Fangio braked hard. He realized that if the faces were not white, then the people in the crowd were not looking towards him. They were looking away from him at something more interesting. Fangio went round the corner more slowly than usual—and around it there was a tremendous pileup of racing cars. If he had been going at normal speed he would have crashed into them…The effect of good observation and interpretation in normal road driving can be just as dramatic and as important to the driver.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"“Observation comes first and interpretation follows...A driver traveling at 30 mph in town is able to notice events and movements in his immediate vicinity because his eyes are adjusted for what might be called close work. At 70 or 80 mph, a driver’s eyes are focused to observe things 200 or 300 or even 400 yards away. He is slow to notice things happening just a few feet from his car…The driver who thinks correctly will be able to appreciate the various and sometimes obscure possibilities of any particular traffic situation and to interpret his observations.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<h3>On Dealing with Other Drivers</h3>\r\n“Some people seem to regard it as their duty to ensure that no other motorist exceeds the speed limit.

So you should do everything in your power to see that there is as big a distance as possible between his car and yours.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<h3>On Rallying</h3>\n“Fog is probably the motorist’s worst enemy.

Pay Attention</h3>\nOne of the Allstate’s first tips for sharing the road with motorcyclists is to look both ways to check for bikers. Motorcycles can hide in blind spots or blend in at intersections. Always make sure that you are fully aware of your surroundings and look for motorcycles before you change lanes or cross an intersection.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>2. No Tailgating</h3>\nThis is good advice no matter whom you’re driving behind, but since motorcycles are especially vulnerable, it counts double when you’re behind a biker. Pick a stationary object like a street sign or a tree and count the seconds between when the rider (or driver) ahead of you passes it and when your front tires go by. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recommends three or four seconds of leeway between a car and the motorcycle it’s following. Maintaining a proper following distance will give you time to react in case of an emergency. Obviously, you can—and should—adjust the three-or-four-second rule if weather or visibility is bad.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Motorcycle Safety","caption":"","fileMasterId":52311621,"fileName":"motorcycle-05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52311621/motorcycle-05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"order":3,"text":"<h3>3. Motorcycles May Be Closer Than They Appear</h3>\nThe Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) notes that since motorcycles are small, they can appear to be farther away than they really are. Since they’re so maneuverable, they can appear to be moving more quickly than they are. Just like the warning on your side mirrors tell you, err on the side of caution and act as if the motorcycles on the road are closer than they appear.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-22T08:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013-porsche-cayenne-in-carmine-red","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46246844/cayenne-Promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":46246844,"fileName":"cayenne-Promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-22T08:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013-porsche-cayenne-in-carmine-red","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46246772/cayenne-header.jpg","fileMasterId":46246772,"fileName":"cayenne-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-22T08:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013-porsche-cayenne-in-carmine-red","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46246826/cayenne-01-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":46246826,"fileName":"cayenne-01-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":462756,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The best thing about Michigan winters is the sensation of slipping into flannel sheets at the end of the day.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-25T12:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"bmw-orange-crush","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52427772/m3-orange-PromoLarge.jpg","fileMasterId":52427772,"fileName":"m3-orange-PromoLarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-25T12:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"bmw-orange-crush","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46105222/m3-orange-header.jpg","fileMasterId":46105222,"fileName":"m3-orange-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-26T05:53:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"2013-bmw-m3-my-orange-crush","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46170646/m3-orange-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":46170646,"fileName":"m3-orange-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":463140,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Being the sister website to <em>Automobile Magazine</em> allows us front-row seats to a rotating selection of the latest vehicles.

Seizinger shared the attention to detail that went into the paint scheme. \"The stripes on the car were hand painted by a local pinstripe artist here [in California]. The colors are traditional BMW M-series colors and were hand applied using different brushes and techniques. We wanted each stripe to have an individual character and feel to it, much like we wanted our car to have. We wanted to evoke the passion of something created by hand in the same way a painting is painted or a sculpture is sculpted. Not temporary and cheap like [a] vinyl sticker. It also pays homage to the way racing stripes were hand applied with brushes in the early days of racing and speed records.” In a nutshell, the car looks like it should be parked in your living room to show what great taste you have in art.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Driving Tips","id":1034956,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-driving-tips","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1023763,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos/qa","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"All Videos","id":1023756,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-23T11:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"no-1-ladies-driving-academy","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52353279/ladies-promolarge.png","fileMasterId":52353279,"fileName":"ladies-promolarge.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-23T11:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"no-1-ladies-driving-academy","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/52353276/Ladies-header.jpg","fileMasterId":52353276,"fileName":"Ladies-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-04-26T06:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"http://adam.automotive.com/default.aspx","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46391774/logo-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":46391774,"fileName":"logo-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":462962,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"I’ve been racking up to 100,000 miles a year since my late teenage years, when I was a taxicab owner/operator.

I really don't. The freedom of getting behind the wheel of a car and just taking off can't be compared with anything else. You really feel that you’re in charge: in charge of the car, in charge of the road, and in charge of your life. Why on earth would you want someone else to drive you around when you could do it yourself? It’s so liberating! Obviously, I love driving. I suppose that isn't a particularly original statement for a Detroit native, but it's true. I was a little late getting my driver's license because of that pesky parallel parking, but once I got it, nothing could stop me. It doesn't matter if I have to chauffeur my grandmother to the bank less than a block from our house or drive across town. If I have my green Chrysler LHS--affectionately christened \"Betsy\" by my mother--and some gas in the tank, and if I am somehow able to avoid getting pulled over for driving just a little too fast, I'm good to go.\n\nSince I graduated from the University of Michigan, in April 2012, Betsy has taken me everywhere. She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn’t as dry as a piece of chalk…And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there. Not only am I a bibliophile, but I’m also a self-proclaimed Anglophile who loves Shakespeare and Elizabethan verse and one day plans to see the Houses of Parliament, visit the Tower of London, and, perhaps most important, eat real fish and chips.

The Odyssey and Sienna (depending on trim level) can seat up to eight.<br>\n- Quest also has <strong>less cargo capacity</strong> than most of its rivals.<br>\n- On the plus side, Quest has a modern, <strong>upscale and sophisticated cabin</strong> and a relative rarity among minivans – a standard push-button start. The LE model also includes a thirteen-speaker Bose sound system, a third-row power return seatback, and a DVD entertainment system.

Large SUVs or vans are the obvious choice for transporting bikes, but hatchbacks can have just as much cargo space with the seats down, can get better fuel economy, and are typically cheaper than full-size SUVs.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.
