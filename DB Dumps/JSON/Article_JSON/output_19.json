This least expensive Beetle ($21,515 coupe, $26,415 convertible) takes the standard features of the 1.8T and is then outfitted with a navigation system, a six-speed automatic transmission, and retro-style 17-inch wheels. Inside, it has two-tone leatherette and checked-cloth seats for a look that’s indeed classic. The Beetle Classic can be chosen in white, black, or silver. The second newsworthy item is the new diesel engine, the very latest from Volkswagen’s engineers. It makes an additional 10 horsepower and gets a 2 mpg fuel economy bump on the highway. With 236 pound-feet of torque available at just 1750 rpm—that’s 14 percent greater than the even high-output gasoline turbo engine in the Beetle R-Line—it provides lots of stomp. Also this year, a rearview camera is standard on all but the base versions of the 1.8T, Beetle Classic, and R-Line. A blind-spot monitor and rear traffic alert are available across the lineup. Each of the four models—1.8T, Classic, R-Line, and TDI—is available as a coupe or convertible. The beauty of a Beetle is the combination of heritage, sportiness, and utility while still pulling off a modern look all its own.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\n2.0-liter turbo-diesel engine, limited-edition Beetle Classic.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volkswagen Beetle interior","fileMasterId":103910321,"fileName":"volkswagen-beetle-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103910321/volkswagen-beetle-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volkswagen Beetle","fileMasterId":103910318,"fileName":"volkswagen-beetle-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103910318/volkswagen-beetle-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volkswagen Beetle","fileMasterId":103910315,"fileName":"volkswagen-beetle-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103910315/volkswagen-beetle-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45233,"make":"Volkswagen","model":"Beetle","year":2015},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:19:58.384-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866398385 }} },{ "_id":678510,"title":"2015 Kia Sportage","subTitle":"Cheeky younger sibling.","slug":"2015-kia-sportage","promoTitle":"2015 Kia Sportage","promoTeaserSmall":"Cheeky younger sibling.","promoTeaser":"Cheeky younger sibling.","keywords":["2015 Kia Sportage"],"metaTitle":"2015 Kia Sportage","metaKeywords":["2015 Kia Sportage; Kia; SUV; sport-utility; crossover; Korean"],"metaDescription":"Cheeky younger sibling.

Proving way more popular than expected after being released in 2009, the Soul brings a quirky kind of custom to the low-price arena. It was extensively revised for 2014, and the result was astonishing. The little runabout has a more solid feel and significantly improved ride and handling. Partly due to a stronger body, the vehicle is quieter. Kia spent some money to upgrade the interior, so it grew more attractive and interesting, with more comfortable seats and greater front legroom. The body’s front and rear were redone, adding drama, and the designers really smacked one out of the park when creating the Soul Exclaim’s cool new high-tech LED tail lamps. For the price, you’ll be surprised by the feature content, with an available heated and ventilated front seats and an infotainment system with excellent Android-based navigation display. The larger direct-injection 2.0-liter four-cylinder packs enough wallop to make this light-middleweight quite entertaining on a back road. For 2015, the Soul EV joined the lineup.

The Sedona is large (although at 201.4 inches, it’s only .8 inch longer than the K900 luxury sedan). Nevertheless, it steps off smartly thanks to the direct-injection 3.3-liter V-6, which makes 276 horsepower. A six-speed automatic transmission modulates the output. Seven-passenger seating is standard, with the Side-N-Stow second-row seat function included to make additional cargo room. Eight-passenger seating is optional in the LX and SX, standard in the EX. Trim levels range from the L, which is basic without being a monk’s cell, to the rather opulent Limited. A wood-trimmed, heated steering wheel and Nappa leather contribute to the interior’s distinctiveness, power side doors and liftgate are included, and 19-inch wheels suggest a formidable paw print. Smart cruise control is available on the Limited. Both the SX and Limited come with a 110-volt inverter in the console zone, letting you plug in a laptop. The Limited has a second inverter in the rear cargo area. The Sedona’s design, engineering, and product development team have done a great job with the new minivan. All entries in this segment are quite comparable in specifications and feature content, but crisp body lines give the Sedona an edge.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"\r\n<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThis all-new model was introduced last fall.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Sedona interior","fileMasterId":103915583,"fileName":"kia-sedona-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103915583/kia-sedona-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Sedona","fileMasterId":103915412,"fileName":"kia-sedona-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103915412/kia-sedona-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Sedona","fileMasterId":103915580,"fileName":"kia-sedona-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103915580/kia-sedona-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43703,"make":"Kia","model":"Sedona","year":2015},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:19:59.120-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866399121 }} },{ "_id":678489,"title":"2015 Kia Cadenza","subTitle":"Near luxury, far cries of satisfaction.","slug":"2015-kia-cadenza","promoTitle":"2015 Kia Cadenza","promoTeaserSmall":"Near luxury, far cries of satisfaction.","promoTeaser":"Near luxury, far cries of satisfaction.","keywords":["2015 Kia Cadenza"],"metaTitle":"2015 Kia Cadenza","metaKeywords":["2015 Kia Cadenza; Kia; sedan; Korean"],"metaDescription":"Near luxury, far cries of satisfaction.

The most basic LX sedan includes a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine making 145 horsepower and a six-speed manual transmission. A six-speed automatic is optional, and it brings the best fuel economy of 39 highway mpg. The Forte LX has some key features like satellite radio, Bluetooth, power windows, and air conditioning. To this basic, inexpensive starting point, you can add a touchscreen, 16-inch alloy wheels, and a backup camera. Moving to the EX model, you find options packages that can give the car many unexpected luxury features. We do love a heated steering wheel. Heated and ventilated seats are available, too. The Koup is sporty, with the 2.0-liter and six-speed manual as standard but a powerful turbocharged 1.6-liter and an available automatic transmission with paddle shifters. EX and SX trim levels are offered, and the EX includes a leather-wrapped steering wheel and LED positioning lamps. Available eighteen-inch alloy wheels give the Koup an aggressive stance. Many of the sedan’s more premium options are found here in both trim levels. Sharing the Koup’s powertrain selection, the Forte5 is a handsome and more upscale four-door hatchback. Meanwhile, with up to 23.2 cubic feet of cargo capacity, the 5 adds a measure of utility to the lineup without sacrificing sportiness.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nImproved fuel economy for the sedan.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Forte sedan interior","fileMasterId":103918562,"fileName":"kia-forte-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103918562/kia-forte-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Forte sedan","fileMasterId":103918559,"fileName":"kia-forte-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103918559/kia-forte-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Forte5","fileMasterId":103918256,"fileName":"kia-forte-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103918256/kia-forte-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Forte sedan","fileMasterId":103918253,"fileName":"kia-forte-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103918253/kia-forte-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45273,"make":"Kia","model":"Forte","year":2015},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:19:59.585-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866399586 }} },{ "_id":678497,"title":"2015 Kia Optima","subTitle":"Boldly striking forth.","slug":"2015-kia-optima","promoTitle":"2015 Kia Optima","promoTeaserSmall":"Boldly striking forth.","promoTeaser":"Boldly striking forth.","keywords":["2015 Kia Optima"],"metaTitle":"2015 Kia Optima","metaKeywords":["2015 Kia Optima; Kia; sedan; Korean"],"metaDescription":"Boldly striking forth.

The UVO2 eServices infotainment system is optional. The Hybrid’s standard equipment is much like that of the LX, while the Hybrid EX adds the infotainment system, rearview camera, and heated steering wheel. Climbing the trim level ladder to the SXL Turbo, we arrive at an elevated refuge of luxury of convenience, represented by a heated flat-bottom steering wheel with unique stitching, seats trimmed with Nappa leather trim, black gloss accents throughout the interior.

The K900 is more than just a case of an existing car being endowed with a lot of gadgets. It’s 200.6 inches long and rather tall-shouldered, so that the 19-inch wheels don’t seem at all too large. In our driveway, it looked stately and prepossessing. The fact that it’s so well equipped for the price seems miraculous. There are two models, Premium and Luxury, sharing the same powertrain. The Premium comes with all the important stuff like illuminated door scuff plates and a power-operated rear sunshade, but the Luxury pursues overkill with an optional 12.3-inch instrument cluster, soft-close doors, and head-up display. As standard features, it adds key safety features (blind spot detection, rear cross traffic alert) and makes smart cruise control optional. A particular delight is the available quilted Nappa leather seat trim. And wait till you see the complexity of the clock that’s mounted in a dashboard. Details and craftsmanship, along with a sound grasp of the grand scheme, make Kia successful in its entry into the luxury segment.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe K900 is a new model this year.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia K900 interior","fileMasterId":103917905,"fileName":"kia-k900-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103917905/kia-k900-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia K900","fileMasterId":103918049,"fileName":"kia-k900-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103918049/kia-k900-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia K900","fileMasterId":103917902,"fileName":"kia-k900-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103917902/kia-k900-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Kia K900</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/2015-kia-k900-luxury/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Kia K900 Luxury, Should You Buy It?</a> February 10, 2015 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround/2015-kia-k900/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Kia K900 Designer Walkaround</a> December 6, 2013 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/events/2015-kia-k900-l-a/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Kia K900: L.A.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Designer Walkaround","id":1034952,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-22T11:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevrolet-bolt-header","title":"Chevrolet Bolt Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95940858/chevrolet-bolt-header.jpg","fileMasterId":95940858,"fileName":"chevrolet-bolt-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-22T11:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevrolet-bolt-header","title":"Chevrolet Bolt Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95940858/chevrolet-bolt-header.jpg","fileMasterId":95940858,"fileName":"chevrolet-bolt-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-22T11:16:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevrolet-bolt-promolarge","title":"Chevrolet Bolt Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/168884762/chevrolet-bolt-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":168884762,"fileName":"chevrolet-bolt-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":986936,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, four-door front-wheel-drive compact electric sedan<br>\r\n<strong>Release date:</strong> Late 2016<br>\r\n<strong>Estimated price range:</strong> $30,000 after federal tax credits<br>\r\n<strong>Competes against:</strong> Ford C-Max Energi, Nissan Leaf<br>\r\n<strong>What's most interesting:</strong> 200 miles of range on a charge<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qJBR4un7s5U?list=PLDtKaZSQcnJCZY-Ge8vAaMITVtB0ZsrMJ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"I had never met Stuart Norris, managing director of General Motors Korea Design, before doing this walkaround at the Detroit auto show.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034953,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/car-on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-19T12:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pilot-promo","title":"Pilot Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98625817/pilot-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":98625817,"fileName":"pilot-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-19T12:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pilot-promo","title":"Pilot Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98625817/pilot-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":98625817,"fileName":"pilot-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-19T12:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"pilot-header","title":"Pilot Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98625814/pilot-header.jpg","fileMasterId":98625814,"fileName":"pilot-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":982430,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Welcome to Five Cool Things from <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">JeanKnowsCars.com</a>!</strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dSrcN_H_MO0?autoplay=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"This is the third-generation Honda Pilot.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034953,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/car-on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-19T12:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"odyssey-promo","title":"Odyssey Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98625733/odyssey-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":98625733,"fileName":"odyssey-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-19T12:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"odyssey-promo","title":"Odyssey Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98625733/odyssey-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":98625733,"fileName":"odyssey-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-19T12:25:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"odyssey-header","title":"Odyssey Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95690118/odyssey-header.jpg","fileMasterId":95690118,"fileName":"odyssey-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":982435,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Welcome to Five Cool Things from <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">JeanKnowsCars.com</a>!</strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VcU35bOkm68?autoplay=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"There's a reason Honda builds minivans.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034953,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/car-on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-21T08:51:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"accord-promolarge","title":"Accord Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95838924/accord-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":95838924,"fileName":"accord-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-21T08:51:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"accord-promolarge","title":"Accord Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95838924/accord-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":95838924,"fileName":"accord-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-21T08:51:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"accord-header","title":"Accord Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/168813980/accord-header.jpg","fileMasterId":168813980,"fileName":"accord-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":982433,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Welcome to Five Cool Things from <a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">JeanKnowsCars.com!</a></strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmQumdw_kCQ?autoplay=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"The Honda Accord is one of America's most respected sedans.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034953,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/car-on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-19T12:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"odyssey-promo","title":"Odyssey Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98625805/odyssey-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":98625805,"fileName":"odyssey-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-19T12:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"odyssey-promo","title":"Odyssey Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98625805/odyssey-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":98625805,"fileName":"odyssey-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-19T12:35:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"odyssey-header","title":"Odyssey Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98626192/odyssey-header.jpg","fileMasterId":98626192,"fileName":"odyssey-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":982434,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Welcome to Five Cool Things from <a href=\"http://www.JeanKnowsCars.com\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">JeanKnowsCars.com</a>!</strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeeaRrplkE8?autoplay=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Try to tell an Odyssey family that minivans aren't cool.

The Forte is available in two body styles, hatchback and sedan; the Forte Koup was discontinued after the 2015 model year. There's even a sporty SX version of the Forte hatchback, featuring 201 horsepower from a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, paired with a standard six-speed manual transmission, and still coming in under $22,000. If you spring for the $3,000 EX Premium package—which will bring the total price up close to $25,000—you'll get such higher-end features as heated and ventilated seats, a seven-inch touchscreen with navigation, and a sunroof.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-02-03T12:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"tire-homepage","title":"Tire Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/99484933/tire-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":99484933,"fileName":"tire-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-02-03T12:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"tire-homepage","title":"Tire Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/99484933/tire-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":99484933,"fileName":"tire-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-02-03T12:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"tire-header","title":"Tire Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/99484879/tire-header.jpg","fileMasterId":99484879,"fileName":"tire-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":988453,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"You’ve heard of snow tires.
