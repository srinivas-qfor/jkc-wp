The Mazda 6 received five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and is a Top Safety Pick Plus, the top rating of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. With 98 cubic feet of passenger volume and 15 cubic feet of cargo space, the Mazda 6 is no minivan, but it is roomy enough.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>New for 2016:</strong><br<br>\nElectronic parking brake<br>\nUpgraded center console, dash, and armrest design<br></br<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda6","fileMasterId":146422364,"fileName":"mazda6-2016-08.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146422364/mazda6-2016-08.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda6","fileMasterId":146422424,"fileName":"mazda6-2016-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146422424/mazda6-2016-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda6","fileMasterId":146422361,"fileName":"mazda6-2016-05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146422361/mazda6-2016-05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda6","fileMasterId":146422367,"fileName":"mazda6-header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146422367/mazda6-header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda6","fileMasterId":146422427,"fileName":"mazda6-2016-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146422427/mazda6-2016-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda6","fileMasterId":146422358,"fileName":"mazda6-2016-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146422358/mazda6-2016-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda6","fileMasterId":146422418,"fileName":"mazda6-2016-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146422418/mazda6-2016-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda6","fileMasterId":146422502,"fileName":"mazda6-2016-09.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146422502/mazda6-2016-09.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda6","fileMasterId":146422433,"fileName":"mazda6-2016-06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146422433/mazda6-2016-06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":8,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Mazda6","fileMasterId":146422436,"fileName":"mazda6-2016-07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146422436/mazda6-2016-07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":9,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More on the 2016 Mazda 6</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/at-home/2016-mazda-6-touring/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Jean's Driveway: 2016 Mazda 6 Touring</a>","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":44006,"make":"Mazda","model":"MAZDA6","year":2016},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:19:11.498-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866351500 }} },{ "_id":694920,"title":"2016 Mazda CX-3","subTitle":"The Mazda of compact crossovers.

There is only one choice of engine – a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with 146 horsepower – and one transmission – six-speed automatic with paddle shifters. Don’t let the limited engine and transmission options get you down, though. The CX-3 comes with a whole slew of notable standard features, including LED lighting, power moonroof, leather seats with suede inserts, and best of all, navigation.

Fun to drive. The CX-5 confirms the stereotype, even as a crossover. With two choices of engines—a 2.0-liter or 2.5-liter—and six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission choices give you some flexibility when shopping for a family-size vehicle. Additionally, all of the automatic-equipped models come standard with a Sport mode button.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-30T15:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"kia-sedona-homepage","title":"Kia Sedona Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/157338488/kia-sedona-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":157338488,"fileName":"kia-sedona-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-30T15:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"kia-sedona-homepage","title":"Kia Sedona Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/157338488/kia-sedona-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":157338488,"fileName":"kia-sedona-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-30T15:13:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"kia-sedona-header","title":"Kia Sedona Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/157338485/kia-sedona-header.jpg","fileMasterId":157338485,"fileName":"kia-sedona-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":972381,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Kia Sedona 02","caption":"","fileMasterId":157338482,"fileName":"kia-sedona-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/157338482/kia-sedona-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>Kia has a plan to help its Sedona thrive even as overall minivan sales continue to decline, faced with American's love affair with the sport-utility vehicle.</strong> It starts with the business-class comfort we found in the 2016 Kia Sedona SXL, the top-of-the-line model from Kia ($44,690 as tested, including destination charge).

A leg rest flips out, fully supporting your legs, and the seat reclines waaaaay back. To afford more space for your legs to fully extend, the entire seat slides back and forth as well as from side to side. I brought along an eyeshade to get maximum comfort, but the SXL comes standard with built-in second- and third-row pull-down sunshades.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

It has a masculine, no-frills feeling inside and a slightly more aggressive appearance outside, with special eighteen-inch wheels and tires, a stiffer suspension, and better noise insulation—including an extra layer of acoustic barrier in the windshield.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

This is where the rearview camera, standard on all Odysseys, comes in handy. Honda’s LaneWatch is part of the package on the Touring Elite model. Put on the right turn signal, and a camera in the passenger’s-side door mirror shows what’s behind your vehicle to the right. is an invaluable aid for people with a vanload of distraction, a.k.a. the eight passengers it can hold.

story written by our founding editor David E. Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-17T19:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-promo","title":"2016 Toyota Rav4 Hybrid Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91905033/2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":91905033,"fileName":"2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-17T19:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-promo","title":"2016 Toyota Rav4 Hybrid Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91905033/2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":91905033,"fileName":"2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-17T19:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-header","title":"2016 Toyota Rav4 Hybrid Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91905201/2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-header.jpg","fileMasterId":91905201,"fileName":"2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":976509,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> All-wheel-drive, five-passenger, four-door crossover utility vehicle <br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> Hybrid XLE, Hybrid Limited <br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $34,510 (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $36,560<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.5-liter four-cylinder with electric motor, 194 combined horsepower <br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Continuously variable automatic <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 34 mpg city/31 mpg highway/33 mpg combined <br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Search-Results?searchtype=model&make=TOYOTA&model=RAV4&year=2016\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">5/5 stars</a>; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: Not yet rated  \n<br>\n<strong>Favorite standard feature:</strong> Height-adjustable power liftgate <br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Trailer sway control, hill start assist, eighteen-inch alloy wheels, LED exterior lighting, heated outside mirrors with integrated turn signal and blind-spot warning indicators, blind spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert,  Toyota Safety Sense suite of driver-assistance features, seven-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth and iPod connectivity, premium audio <br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, Hyundai Tucson, Kia Sportage, Chevrolet Equinox  <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"1998001 1998 RAV4  1","caption":"","fileMasterId":160299098,"fileName":"1998001-1998-RAV4--1-.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160299098/1998001-1998-RAV4--1-.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":321},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Twenty years ago, the Toyota RAV4 helped to change our way of thinking about compact vehicles.</strong> As a “cute ute,” the RAV4 offered a high seating position, great maneuverability, and more utility than compact sedans.

Redesigned head- and taillights and an aggressive black grille give the diminutive hatchback—offered in both three- and five-door bodystyles—a sportier look. The interior received a thorough restyle as well with upgraded seats—a six-way-adjustable driver’s seat is standard—soft-touch materials on the front doors and instrument panel, and a new gauge cluster. Toyota took steps to reduce road noise from entering the cabin by using acoustic windshield glass and adding more sound deadening materials throughout the cabin. The Yaris grew by two inches overall as well and a wider track, a retuned suspension, and a more rigid structure should help improve the Yaris’s stability and handling. A first for Yaris is the option of a dealer installed navigation system. Black trim on the headlights and wheels dress up the top-of-the-line SE. In fact, all the Yaris models are looking sharper thanks to the work of Toyota’s ED2 studio located in the South of France. Seems like the little Yaris is growing up but thankfully the price tag still remains in its teens.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nA makeover that includes a wider trapezoid grille, new fog, head- and taillights, nicer interior materials, and increased sound deadening in the cabin.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Yaris interior","fileMasterId":103928156,"fileName":"toyota-yaris-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103928156/toyota-yaris-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Yaris","fileMasterId":103928258,"fileName":"toyota-yaris-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103928258/toyota-yaris-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Yaris","fileMasterId":103928153,"fileName":"toyota-yaris-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103928153/toyota-yaris-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Yaris","fileMasterId":103928249,"fileName":"toyota-yaris-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103928249/toyota-yaris-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":44947,"make":"Toyota","model":"Yaris","year":2015},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:19:19.937-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866359938 }} },{ "_id":673963,"title":"2015 Toyota Venza","subTitle":"Making an effort.","slug":"2015-toyota-venza","promoTitle":"2015 Toyota Venza","promoTeaserSmall":"Making an effort.","promoTeaser":"Making an effort.","keywords":["2015 Toyota Venza"],"metaTitle":"2015 Toyota Venza","metaKeywords":["2015 Toyota Venza; Toyota; crossover; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"Making an effort.

The base LE comes with helpful dual zone climate control, display screen, and reading lights for the spacious rear seat row. The XLE and Limited models get more standard luxury features like heated seats, a leather trimmed steering wheel, and keyless entry and start. The Limited is powered by the 3.5-liter V-6 mated to all-wheel drive, delivering the power and handling expected for $40,000. Otherwise the LE and XLE offer your choice of front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive and the XLE can be fitted with the base four-cylinder or upgraded to the V-6. For $2000, the V-6 is a bit of a no-brainer since it gets nearly the same gas millage as the four-cylinder and moves the Venza with an authority the four just can’t match.

Once you’ve got your cab sorted, think about bed length—short or long, both come standard with a composite liner and two-tier loading deck—and drive wheels—rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. Don’t forget to consider the powertrain. There are two-engine sizes and four transmission choices. After all that, choosing the exterior color and options should be a cinch.

The 2015 exterior refresh includes slimmer headlights and sharper front grille. Inside, Sienna veterans will appreciate the new more cohesive dash design. Gone is the asymmetrical swoop in the dash to make way for a thoughtful, driver-oriented center panel that facilitates efficient use of the various controls like the three-zone climate system and displays for multi-media and navigation. Several trims are available beginning with the base L starting at just over $30,000, and climaxing with the Limited trim that will put you well over $40,000. All-wheel drive is available on several models, LE, XLE and Limited, and those with more sporting aspirations will gravitate toward the SE trim and its sport-tuned suspension and more aggressive exterior accents. With the second-row bench and the third row upright, the Sienna can carry eight passengers. If you choose the second-row captain’s chairs, that number is reduced to seven. Should those passengers get out of hand, you have a new ally in the ground-breaking Driver Easy Speak option. It broadcasts your voice—without having to shout—through the vehicle’s speaker system, “Attention, this is your mother speaking.

The brawny V-8, integrated hitch, and trailer-sway control system make towing—a maximum of 7,400 pounds—a breeze. You do have a choice of either two-wheel or four-wheel drive. If driving challenges like steep inclines or difficult weather figure regularly into your schedule, consider adding Toyota’s Multi-Mode 4-wheel-drive system with a limited-slip locking center differential. The interior is voluminous to be sure, seating eight adults while still maintaining 18.9 cubic feet of dedicated cargo space in the back. Fold down the second- and third-row seats and capacity reaches an expansive 120.1 cubic feet. <br><br>The ultra-wide dash accommodates all the necessary instrumentation, climate controls, and even double-decker glove compartments. Still, for its size this large SUV has one of the tightest turning circles you’ll find and handles the curves with unexpected grace. Adventure essentials like running boards, roof rack, and headlight-washers are standard on all three trims. Choose the SR5 Sport Appearance package for a unique black interior. The Limited offers some leather accents and Lexus-inspired gauges, while the Platinum ramps up the mechanical tech with adaptive air suspension and a laser-based cruise control system that measures the distance to the cars ahead and brakes when necessary. Fortunately, the Sequoia does not suffer from the boxy exterior design so common in its class giving it the kind of driveway appeal your neighbors may appreciate.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nEntune audio system with navigation and the Toyota App suite.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Sequoia interior","fileMasterId":103932818,"fileName":"toyota-sequoia-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103932818/toyota-sequoia-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Sequoia","fileMasterId":103932815,"fileName":"toyota-sequoia-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103932815/toyota-sequoia-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota Sequoia","fileMasterId":103932806,"fileName":"toyota-sequoia-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103932806/toyota-sequoia-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45487,"make":"Toyota","model":"Sequoia","year":2015},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:19:21.114-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866361115 }} },{ "_id":673950,"title":"2015 Toyota RAV4","subTitle":"Getting better every year.","slug":"2015-toyota-rav4","promoTitle":"2015 Toyota RAV4","promoTeaserSmall":"Getting better every year.","promoTeaser":"Getting better every year.","keywords":["2015 Toyota RAV4"],"metaTitle":"2015 Toyota RAV4","metaKeywords":["2015 Toyota RAV4; Toyota; SUV; sport-utility; crossover; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"Getting better every year.

While it’s grown larger, it’s also become more stylish with a subtly sculpted exterior and an attractive, smartly organized interior. Despite it’s more polished look, the RAV4 still excels as a cargo carrier. It can swallow more than 37 cubic feet of gear behind its third row and more than 70 with its third- and second-row seats folded. It can be also be optioned with all wheel drive. Three trims are available. The base LE comes standard with an array of comfort and safety features, the only option being roof rails. The XLE includes the rails, a moonroof, five-spoke seventeen-inch alloy wheels, and adds HD radio and traffic to infotainment system, Entune. A two-tone terracotta and black interior adds a little flair on the Limited edition. Not quite as luxurious as the name Limited implies, it does add leather trim on steering wheel shifter, a height-adjustable power liftgate, and eighteen-inch alloy wheels. The Limited also can be optioned with driving aids like blind spot warning, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert, and lane departure warning. Every trim includes a backup camera, Toyota’s Star Safety system that improves brake reaction, traction, and stability, as well as two 12-volt power outlets. And for days when you are have to squeeze that oversized science project to school, you’ll appreciate a second row that folds completely flat. The RAV4 proves you don’t have to be surrounded by leather and wood to feel well taken care of.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nEighteen-inch wheels with black painted pockets and pearl white exterior paint are part of the new Blizzard Pearl Premium Package, available on the Limited trim only.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota RAV4 interior","fileMasterId":103933640,"fileName":"toyota-rav4-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103933640/toyota-rav4-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota RAV4","fileMasterId":103933592,"fileName":"toyota-rav4-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103933592/toyota-rav4-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Toyota RAV4","fileMasterId":103933589,"fileName":"toyota-rav4-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103933589/toyota-rav4-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45486,"make":"Toyota","model":"RAV4","year":2015},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:19:21.382-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866361382 }} },{ "_id":705563,"title":"2017 Ford Escape","subTitle":"Check out the safety and connectivity added to the menu for the new generation of Ford's compact crossover.","slug":"2017-ford-escape","promoTitle":"2017 Ford Escape","promoTeaserSmall":"Check out the safety and connectivity added to the menu for the new generation of Ford's compact crossover.","promoTeaser":"Check out the safety and connectivity added to the menu for the new generation of Ford's compact crossover.","keywords":["2017 Ford Escape -

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-18T12:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-infiniti-qx30-homepage","title":"2017 Infiniti Qx30 Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160412420/2017-infiniti-qx30-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":160412420,"fileName":"2017-infiniti-qx30-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-18T12:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-infiniti-qx30-homepage","title":"2017 Infiniti Qx30 Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160412420/2017-infiniti-qx30-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":160412420,"fileName":"2017-infiniti-qx30-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-18T12:43:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-infiniti-qx30-header","title":"2017 Infiniti Qx30 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/94938196/2017-infiniti-qx30-header.jpg","fileMasterId":94938196,"fileName":"2017-infiniti-qx30-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":977722,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Four-door, five-passenger front- or all-wheel-drive crossover utility vehicle <br>\n<strong>Release date:</strong> Mid-2016<br>\n<strong>Estimated price:</strong> Upper $30,000 to mid-$40,000 range <br>\n<strong>Competes against:</strong> Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class, BMW X1, Acura RDX <br>\n<strong>What’s most interesting:</strong> Voluptuous styling <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"The Infiniti QX30 is made of the same basic pieces as its competitors, but how they’re put together adds up to something special.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-18T13:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-buick-lacrosse-homepage","title":"2017 Buick Lacrosse Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160417718/2017-buick-lacrosse-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":160417718,"fileName":"2017-buick-lacrosse-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-18T13:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-buick-lacrosse-homepage","title":"2017 Buick Lacrosse Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160417718/2017-buick-lacrosse-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":160417718,"fileName":"2017-buick-lacrosse-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-18T13:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-buick-lacrosse-header","title":"2017 Buick Lacrosse Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160417715/2017-buick-lacrosse-header.jpg","fileMasterId":160417715,"fileName":"2017-buick-lacrosse-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":977657,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Four-door, five-passenger, front- and all-wheel-drive sedan <br>\n<strong>Release date:</strong> Summer 2016 <br>\n<strong>Estimated price:</strong> Mid-$30,000s <br>\n<strong>Competes against:</strong> Lexus ES350, Toyota Avalon, Lincoln MKZ <br>\n<strong>What’s most interesting:</strong> Tri-shield insignia is redesigned with colors added for a new Buick image <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Big and sleek, the 2017 Buick LaCrosse presents a persuasive case for a luxurious sedan</strong> that goes about its business swiftly and quietly.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-21T07:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-hyundai-sonata-hybrid-homepage","title":"2016 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146329337/2016-hyundai-sonata-hybrid-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":146329337,"fileName":"2016-hyundai-sonata-hybrid-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-21T07:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-hyundai-sonata-hybrid-homepage","title":"2016 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146329337/2016-hyundai-sonata-hybrid-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":146329337,"fileName":"2016-hyundai-sonata-hybrid-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-21T07:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-hyundai-sonata-hybrid-header","title":"2016 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146329448/2016-hyundai-sonata-hybrid-header.jpg","fileMasterId":146329448,"fileName":"2016-hyundai-sonata-hybrid-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":962563,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2016 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Limited</h3>\n<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, front-wheel-drive hybrid sedan<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> SE, Limited<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $26,825 (SE); $30,925 (Limited) (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $35,765<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 2.0-liter four-cylinder plus lithium-polymer battery with electric motor; total 193  horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 39 mpg city/43 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Vehicle-Detail?vehicleId=10019\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">5/5 stars</a>; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: <a href=\"http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/hyundai/sonata-4-door-sedan/2015\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2015 Top Safety Pick</a><br>\n<strong>Competition</strong> (all prices include destination charges):<br>\n2016 Ford Fusion Hybrid Titanium ($31,815)<br>\n2015 Honda Accord Hybrid EX-L ($32,875)<br>\n2016 Toyota Camry Hybrid XLE ($34,955)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter: 7<br></strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2016 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid 09X","caption":"","fileMasterId":146329370,"fileName":"2016-hyundai-sonata-hybrid-09x.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/146329370/2016-hyundai-sonata-hybrid-09x.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>What would it take to get you to buy a hybrid car?</strong> It’s a question worth asking, because for many years people have thought they were too expensive, technologically a little scary, or just not worth the hassle for a few extra mpg.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-18T15:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-homepage","title":"2016 Gmc Yukon Xl Denali Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160443569/2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":160443569,"fileName":"2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-18T15:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-homepage","title":"2016 Gmc Yukon Xl Denali Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160443569/2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":160443569,"fileName":"2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-18T15:17:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-header","title":"2016 Gmc Yukon Xl Denali Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160443758/2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-header.jpg","fileMasterId":160443758,"fileName":"2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":977665,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Eight-passenger, rear- or all-wheel-drive extended-length sport-utility vehicle<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> XL SLE, XL SLT, XL Denali<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $51,635 (base XL SLE 2WD), $71,940 (Denali 4WD) (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $76,600<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 6.2-liter V-8, 378 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Eight-speed automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 14 mpg city/20 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Vehicle-Detail?vehicleId=10307\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">4/5 stars</a>; \nInsurance Institute for Highway Safety: Not rated<br>\n<strong>Competition</strong> (all prices include destination charges):<br>\n2016 Cadillac Escalade ESV Standard AWD ($79,565)<br>\n2016 Ford Expedition EL Platinum AWD ($67,220)<br>\n2015 Infiniti QX80 AWD ($67,345)<br>\n2016 Lincoln Navigator L AWD ($70,330)<br>\n2016 Toyota Sequoia Platinum ($65,715)<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2016 Gmc Yukon Xl Denali 7","caption":"","fileMasterId":94952965,"fileName":"2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-7.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/94952965/2016-gmc-yukon-xl-denali-7.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>There are stylish cars, there are big utility vehicles—and then there’s the 2016 GMC Yukon XL Denali,</strong> a prime example of both.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-19T09:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"subaru-impreza-homepage","title":"Subaru Impreza Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91949688/subaru-impreza-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":91949688,"fileName":"subaru-impreza-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-19T09:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"subaru-impreza-homepage","title":"Subaru Impreza Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91949688/subaru-impreza-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":91949688,"fileName":"subaru-impreza-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-19T09:01:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"subaru-impreza-header","title":"Subaru Impreza Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95006923/subaru-impreza-header.jpg","fileMasterId":95006923,"fileName":"subaru-impreza-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":977661,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Four-door, five-passenger sedan <br>\r\n<strong>Release date:</strong> Late 2016 as 2017 model<br>\r\n<strong>Estimated price:</strong> $22,000 <br>\r\n<strong>Competes against:</strong> Honda Civic, Ford Focus, Chevrolet Cruze <br>\r\n<strong>What’s most interesting:</strong> Unprecedented aggressiveness of Subaru design <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Subaru will no longer play nice.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-19T11:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-kia-sportage-homepage","title":"2017 Kia Sportage Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95019823/2017-kia-sportage-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":95019823,"fileName":"2017-kia-sportage-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-19T11:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-kia-sportage-homepage","title":"2017 Kia Sportage Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/95019823/2017-kia-sportage-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":95019823,"fileName":"2017-kia-sportage-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-11-19T11:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2017-kia-sportage-header","title":"2017 Kia Sportage Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91961649/2017-kia-sportage-header.jpg","fileMasterId":91961649,"fileName":"2017-kia-sportage-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":977662,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Four-door, five-passenger, front- and all-wheel-drive compact crossover <br>\r\n<strong>Release date:</strong> Early spring 2016 <br>\r\n<strong>Estimated price:</strong> $23,000 <br>\r\n<strong>Competes against:</strong> Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Ford Escape, Hyundai Tucson <br>\r\n<strong>What’s most interesting:</strong> Can’t stop looking at that face! <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Kia has once again shown its knack for shrewd product development as it unveiled the 2017 Sportage,</strong> a compact crossover that appeals in every way.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

It is named for its boxer (horizontally opposed) four-cylinder engine and its rear-wheel drive.

The Premium doesn't have any of these, even as options. All BRZs get Starlink infotainment with a 6.2-inch screen, Sirius XM satellite radio, and smartphone integration. One option is the six-speed automatic transmission with manual mode and paddle shifters, which adds $1,000 to the price and improves fuel economy.

The all-new Malibu is bigger, sleeker-looking, and loaded with technological choices. The big news is more space inside, with 1.3 more inches of rear legroom and a four-inch improvement in the car's wheelbase. The other big news is a Malibu Hybrid, built on a version of the Chevrolet Volt's powertrain and its regenerative braking system, with a battery pack that can run the Malibu up to 55 mph on electricity alone.  OnStar with a 4G LTE Wi-Fi hot spot is available on all models, and wireless smartphone charging is an option on upper-level models.

Right? It’s time to rethink that, now that winter tires are better than they’ve ever been. All-season tires are great, but, well, to quote the tire experts at mega tire supplier <a href=\"http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/tiretech.jsp?tab=Winter\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tire Rack,</a> they can be jack of all trades, master of none.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"If you want to be at your safest and most confident all year round, your best bet is to alternate all-season tires in the warm months with winter-rated tires from late fall to spring. Even if you aren’t in the Snow Belt, but go skiing on weekends or occasionally encounter snowy conditions, winter tires are a good investment.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Here are five reasons why.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<strong>1. Winter tires remain more pliable in the snow.</strong> All-season tires are stiffer than winter tires. So, as the weather drops below 40 degrees and the roads get more frozen, an all-season tire becomes like hard plastic on the road. Winter tires are made of a softer compound, so they remain pliable at lower temperatures.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<strong>2. Winter tires are built right to push the snow out.</strong> On winter roads, your tires have to cope with a film of water over the road when it’s slushy, wet, or icy. Today’s modern studless ice and snow tires have aggressive tread patterns, with more sipes, or grooves, to take the fluid in and wick it back out. Winter tires have many sipes (deep cuts in the tread) to grab the snow and keep you in control. It’s like black magic.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<strong>3. No technology can improve your grip the way the right tires can.</strong> A front-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive vehicle is more stable in the snow and ice. Anti-lock brakes and traction control will improve the car’s handling. But the tires are where grip comes from. Snow tires have more “bite” to grip the way you need them to on snow and ice.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<strong>4. On winter tires, you can stop, accelerate, and turn better.</strong> Stopping, going, and turn distance are all improved in slushy, wet, and icy conditions with winter tires. In a test on ice comparing all-season versus winter cars, Tire Rack found that the winter-tire-clad car stopped 18.5 feet quicker, could corner 3 mph faster without hitting cones on the course, and could accelerate from a stop 25 percent faster than the car with all-season tires.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-07T08:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-hyundai-veloster-homepage","title":"2016 Hyundai Veloster Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96704026/2016-hyundai-veloster-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":96704026,"fileName":"2016-hyundai-veloster-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-07T08:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-hyundai-veloster-homepage","title":"2016 Hyundai Veloster Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96704026/2016-hyundai-veloster-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":96704026,"fileName":"2016-hyundai-veloster-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-07T08:26:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-hyundai-veloster-3","title":"2016 Hyundai Veloster 3","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96703558/2016-hyundai-veloster-3.jpg","fileMasterId":96703558,"fileName":"2016-hyundai-veloster-3.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":980278,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2016 Hyundai Veloster Rally Edition</h3>\n<strong>Type:</strong> Four-passenger, three-door front-wheel-drive sport coupe<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> Veloster, Turbo, Turbo R-Spec, Rally Edition<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $24,775 (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $24,920<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder, 201 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed manual with B&M Racing sport shifter<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 25 mpg city/33 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: 5/5 stars http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Vehicle-Detail?vehicleId=10016; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: Not yet rated<br>\n<strong>Competition</strong> (all prices include destination charges):<br>\n2016 Ford Fiesta ST ($21,845)<br>\n2016 Kia Soul !

Hyundai told me that it’s still recommended to wash the car by hand, using a specialized matte-finish care kit, to maintain the matteness of the matte-finish paint.

Jean","firstName":"Molly","lastName":"Jean","jobTitle":"Senior Editor","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"When I turned sixteen, my dad brought home the very first-generation Ford Escort wagon, and it just so happened to have a manual transmission. Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Aftermarket","id":1034783,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/aftermarket-car-parts","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-08T06:53:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"trip-homepage","title":"Trip Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/93885363/trip-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":93885363,"fileName":"trip-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-08T06:53:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"trip-homepage","title":"Trip Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/93885363/trip-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":93885363,"fileName":"trip-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-07T13:55:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"trip-header","title":"Trip Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96758065/trip-header.jpg","fileMasterId":96758065,"fileName":"trip-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":979940,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"If Santa is not flush enough to deliver a brand-new car to you this year, you can hope for the <a href=\"http://www.jbl.com/ifa-products/JBLTRIP.html\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">JBL Trip</a>.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-07T19:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-chevrolet-camaro-homepage","title":"2016 Chevrolet Camaro Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96813751/2016-chevrolet-camaro-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":96813751,"fileName":"2016-chevrolet-camaro-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-07T19:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-chevrolet-camaro-homepage","title":"2016 Chevrolet Camaro Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96813751/2016-chevrolet-camaro-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":96813751,"fileName":"2016-chevrolet-camaro-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-07T19:45:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-chevrolet-camaro-header","title":"2016 Chevrolet Camaro Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/96813748/2016-chevrolet-camaro-header.jpg","fileMasterId":96813748,"fileName":"2016-chevrolet-camaro-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":979404,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, rear-wheel-drive sport coupe<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> 1LT, 2LT, 1SS, 2SS<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $42,295 (price includes destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $45,385<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 6.2-liter V-8, 455 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Eight-speed automatic with paddle shifters <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 20 mpg city/28 mpg highway <br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: Not yet rated; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: Not yet rated<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Side blind zone alert<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Apple CarPlay, OnStar 4G LTE with wireless hot spot, rearview camera, wireless phone charging, SS appearance package, Brembo brakes<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Magnetic Ride Control, dual-mode exhaust, sunroof <br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> <br>\n2016 Ford Mustang GT Premium ($37,295)<br>\n2016 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 ($48,695)<br>\n2016 Dodge Challenger SRT 392 ($51,190) <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Can you believe that Chevy’s sixth-generation 2016 Camaro marks the nameplate’s forty-eighth year in existence?</strong> Just to remind us all, this fall Chevrolet invited what seems like every automotive journalist in the United States (including me) on their forty-eight-state launch celebration.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

The first electric traffic light had yet to be installed. They adapted along the way to many advances in vehicle safety throughout their lives: freeways, mandatory seatbelts, and safety glass, for instance. All of these advancements have saved lives and the roundabouts that have long been common in Europe have burst onto American soil to save our lives with an added benefit of reducing traffic congestion.<br>\n<br>\nThe roundabouts are here to stay, so it is time you stopped avoiding them and start to embrace them. I wholeheartedly agree they are a bit daunting at first. I especially dislike the double roundabout just north of Ann Arbor at the freeway interchange. I once accidentally re-entered the freeway when I was trying to go to a restaurant. My daughter, then ten years old, was starving and sobbing in the back seat as the restaurant receded in the background. We could see the food; we just couldn't get to it.

I can’t imagine there are very many drivers who have not witnessed a car blatantly running a red light.

Keep your road-management supplies accessible.</strong> If there’s any chance of snow, have a shovel, a bag of kitty litter for traction, and a good ice scraper on board. Pack them last, so you don’t have to take all your luggage out of the car to get to it when you need it. Another tip that we hope you won’t need:  ensure you have a spare tire on board. You’d be surprised how many newer cars don’t come with them. Again, make sure it’s accessible without unpacking the whole car.

Have weather-appropriate gear for everybody who is riding in the car.</strong> It doesn’t matter that it’s not snowing and the roads are clear; things can change quickly. If you’re in a colder climate or headed to one, everybody in the car needs to have a coat, boots, gloves, and a hat. If you don’t ever need them, no big deal. If you need them desperately and don’t have them, that could become a very big deal.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<strong>3. Expect something to go wrong, and be ready for it.</strong> Blankets, a basic first aid kit, flashlight and batteries, and bottled water make up the bare minimum of supplies you should have in the car in the winter. Even better, bring along nonperishable foods for everyone, including for any pets who are riding along. Granola and chocolate bars aren’t damaged by the cold and give a quick energy boost. If you are lucky enough to be traveling with small children, don’t forget extra baby formula, foods they can eat, and utensils to feed them with.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<strong>4. Keep control of your chargers, batteries, and electronic equipment.</strong> There’s nothing worse than arriving at your destination and realizing you don’t have a phone charger with you—unless it’s being stuck in a traffic jam for hours, while realizing you didn’t bring a phone charger. If you’re traveling with several family members, a communal tech bag is a good way to make sure cords and batteries don’t get misplaced during the journey and make it home with you at the end.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<strong>5. Remember what you’re in the car to do.</strong> It’s easy to get caught up in the stress of holiday travel and forget that, presumably, you are traveling with your loved ones and heading out to see other people you care about. Don’t let the pursuit of the destination make you forget that. Take advantage of the time you’re confined together in the car, and try to enjoy one another’s company. Sometimes the best thing to pack is a sense of humor. Leave enough time to work around unavoidable delays on the road, plan for problems, and bring your patience. Everyone’s holiday will be better if you do, especially yours. And it will leave you in the right frame of mind to start planning next summer’s road trip early in the New Year.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":1},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":true,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:19:40.777-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866380778 }} },{ "_id":707716,"title":"2016 Dodge Dart Rallye Blacktop","subTitle":"Blacked-out appearance packages make the most of this compact sedan.","slug":"2016-dodge-dart-rallye-blacktop","promoTitle":"2016 Dodge Dart Rallye Blacktop","promoTeaserSmall":"Blacked-out appearance packages make the most of this compact sedan.","promoTeaser":"Blacked-out appearance packages make the most of this compact sedan.","keywords":["2016 Dodge Dart Rallye Blacktop"],"metaTitle":"2016 Dodge Dart Rallye Blacktop - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["2016 Dodge Dart Rallye Blacktop","2016 Dodge Dart","Dodge Dart Rallye Blacktop","Dodge Dart history","Dodge cars","Dodge sedans","compact sedans","2016 sedans","2016 Ford Focus","2016 Honda Civic","2016 Mazda 3","2016 Nissan Altima"],"metaDescription":"Blacked-out appearance packages make the most of this compact sedan.","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2015-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2015-12-21T11:40:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2015-12-16T11:40:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":false,"url":"/you-auto-know/car-buying/2016-dodge-dart-rallye-blacktop/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

Trax is a member of a relatively new variety of vehicle, the subcompact crossover, which has a 100.3-inch wheelbase—only an inch or two longer than a Honda Fit or a Ford Fiesta—and the tall body of a sport-utility vehicle. Its mere existence is a tribute to the fact that people are increasingly swapping out their sedans for practical, high-riding vehicles with available all-wheel drive. There's no denying that the Trax, all new in 2015, is an attractive choice in this category. It's nominally a five-passenger vehicle, but you wouldn't really want to be the person in the middle of the back seat. With that back seat folded, there are 48.4 cubic feet of cargo space. For comparison purposes, the Honda CR-V, a more traditionally sized compact crossover, offers 70.9 cubic feet with its rear seat down. So the Trax may not be the big-stuff hauler, if that's what you are looking for, but if you want an adorable urban runabout, it has much to recommend it.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2016 Chevrolet Trax 9","caption":"","fileMasterId":160787768,"fileName":"2016-chevrolet-trax-9.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/160787768/2016-chevrolet-trax-9.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":2,"text":"For example, there is a standard rearview camera, available park assist, and a seven-inch touchscreen with OnStar and 4G LTE with a wireless hot spot on board.

The 2016 Chevrolet Volt looks a whole lot more like a \"normal\" five-passenger car and less like some kind of futuristic fantasy of the 1990s, and that is a very good thing. It wasn't a big seller in its original incarnation (fewer than 80,000 sold in the five years on the market), even though it has the advantage over plug-in hybrids of being seamless, switching from all-electric to gasoline power with no human intervention. On all-electric power, you can go 53 miles, and it has a 420-mile range between trips to the gas station. That's up 40 miles from the previous model.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"The 2016 Chevrolet Volt has a 20 percent larger battery pack (which lives under the floor near the center of the car) and a more powerful, yet lighter gasoline engine. The car as a whole weighs 200 pounds less than the outgoing model, a good thing if you're interested in fuel economy—and surely you are, if you're considering the Volt. It also has more space in the back seat—you can even seat five now, but only in a pinch.

The Silverado lineup can satisfy them, no matter what they are, with a regular-cab model with a standard or long truck box; a double-cab model with a short box; or a crew cab with either short or standard box length. You can also get the Silverado with rear- or all-wheel drive and in a choice of seven trim levels. The base WT dresses up with a Black Out Edition this year ($1,595), which should appeal to young entry-level buyers with its 20-inch black-painted wheels, blacked-out grille surround, front bumper and grille, and even black Chevrolet bowtie emblems.

This technology uses radar sensors to watch the road ahead of you and will adjust your car’s speed automatically in line with what the traffic ahead is doing, often at speeds all the way down to 0 mph, saving your right leg from that constant dance between the brake and the accelerator. The Audi A6 and up, BMW 5 Series and up, and the Tesla Model S are some of the vehicles that offer this kind of intelligent cruise control.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-22T13:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-cadillac-cts-v-promo","title":"2016 Cadillac Cts V Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/163523117/2016-cadillac-cts-v-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":163523117,"fileName":"2016-cadillac-cts-v-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-22T13:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-cadillac-cts-v-promo","title":"2016 Cadillac Cts V Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/163523117/2016-cadillac-cts-v-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":163523117,"fileName":"2016-cadillac-cts-v-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-12-22T13:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-cadillac-cts-v-header","title":"2016 Cadillac Cts V Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/163523114/2016-cadillac-cts-v-header.jpg","fileMasterId":163523114,"fileName":"2016-cadillac-cts-v-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":982489,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, rear-wheel-drive luxury sport sedan<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $85,990 (prices include destination charge and $1,000 gas guzzler tax)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $91,690<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Supercharged 6.2-liter V-8, 640 horsepower, 630 pound-feet of torque<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Eight-speed automatic transmission with launch control, performance algorithm shifting, and paddle shifters<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 14 mpg city/21 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Vehicle-Detail?vehicleId=10293\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">5/5 stars</a>; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: <a href=\"http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/cadillac/cts-4-door-sedan\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Good</a> in four categories, Marginal in small overlap front test <br>\n<strong>Competition</strong> (all prices include destination charges):<br>\n2016 Audi S6 $76,225<br>\n2015 BMW M5 $99,595<br>\n2015 Mercedes-AMG E63S Sedan $102,625<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:  9</strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2016 Cadillac Cts V 16","caption":"","fileMasterId":163523219,"fileName":"2016-cadillac-cts-v-16.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/163523219/2016-cadillac-cts-v-16.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>The 2016 Cadillac CTS-V has finally done what no American luxury car has been able to do since,</strong> well, since Cadillac did it once before, back when the Earth’s crust was cooling.

To signal the change, the tachometer display went from black to white. In Sport, the CTS-V was much more comfortable in its own skin.

But from the driver’s seat, the view is anti-Germanic: shiny and celebratory in a way that is also distinctly American, all piano black and brightly colored dials splashed across the Cadillac’s dashboard. You might call it vulgar in a nice way, proudly stating its Americanness in a way that many people won’t like.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"The CTS-V I tested had the optional Recaro high-performance seats ($2,300).

You can ameliorate the situation by reconfiguring the dashboard screen in front of your face to bring in some of the touchscreen functions. Another good thing is Cadillac’s exceptional voice recognition system, which removed a lot of my Cue angst by allowing me to direct most of the things I wanted to happen by just telling it to do so.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

Reps for the automaker had very few details about the U.S. version—such as price, fuel economy, range—but a quick look at the European model's specs is encouraging. It boasts thirty-two miles of electric-only range, and 541 combined miles between fill-ups.

And speaking of impressive numbers, how about 200 horsepower, 200 miles on a charge, 0 to 60 mph in under seven seconds?

The new truck addresses that with a much more conventional look, although it continues to defy pickup convention with its foundations, shared with the new Pilot.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-08T10:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lexus-promolarge","title":"Lexus Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/167958689/lexus-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":167958689,"fileName":"lexus-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-08T10:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"lexus-promolarge","title":"Lexus Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/167958689/lexus-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":167958689,"fileName":"lexus-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-08T10:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2016-lexus-rx-header","title":"2016 Lexus Rx Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/167958632/2016-lexus-rx-header.jpg","fileMasterId":167958632,"fileName":"2016-lexus-rx-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":984476,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, front- or all-wheel-drive luxury crossover<br>\r\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> RX350, RX350 F Sport<br>\r\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $43,800 (prices include destination charge)<br>\r\n<strong>This car:</strong> $54,755<br>\r\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.5-liter V-6, 295 horsepower<br>\r\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Eight-speed automatic<br>\r\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 20 mpg city/28 mpg highway<br>\r\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: Not yet rated; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: Not yet rated<br>\r\n<strong>Competition</strong> (all prices include destination charges):<br>\r\n2016 Audi Q5 Premium ($40,900)<br>\r\n2016 BMW X3 sDrive 28i ($39,945)<br>\r\n2016 Lincoln MKX ($39,185)<br>\r\n2016 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 ($40,800)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong>  5 <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2016 Lexus Rx 12","caption":"","fileMasterId":167958659,"fileName":"2016-lexus-rx-12.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/167958659/2016-lexus-rx-12.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>It’s possible that you will never get used to the look of the 2016 Lexus RX350.</strong> The side profile looks like it was in a sword fight.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Events","id":1034786,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/events","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-14T11:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"naias-promo","title":"Naias Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/168480536/naias-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":168480536,"fileName":"naias-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-14T11:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"naias-promo","title":"Naias Promo","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/168480536/naias-promo.jpg","fileMasterId":168480536,"fileName":"naias-promo.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2016-01-14T11:38:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"naias-header","title":"Naias Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98279467/naias-header.jpg","fileMasterId":98279467,"fileName":"naias-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":986051,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Every year, Detroit’s auto show is an eagerly anticipated bright spot in the grayness of Michigan in January.</strong> This year’s media preview was a tiny bit less glittery in that several luxury brands—Bentley, Jaguar Land Rover, Maserati, Rolls-Royce, and Tesla—chose not to participate.

The Precision Concept is a four-door sedan that may look as expensive as the $150,000-plus NSX supercar, but it actually is the harbinger of the near future for Acura’s more consumer-friendly lineup. Design chief Dave Marek promised that the “diamond pentagon” grille treatment in particular is going to be seen sooner rather than later.

For the second year in a row, Buick rolled out an extremely attractive concept—last year, it was the Avenir, which led to the all-new LaCrosse that goes on sale this summer. This year, it's the drop-dead gorgeous Avista two-plus-two sport coupe that captured all the attention, with its sexy sheetmetal shown to perfect advantage by a startling deep blue paint job. The Avista concept shows off some of the luxury features a Buick might be expected to carry, such as ionic air purifiers, aromatherapy, and noise cancellation technology. The swoopy center console has \"a future vision\" of the already good IntelliLink infotainment system with a wide screen and touch controls.The door and seat trim have 3D-printed elements. The powertrain also features cylinder deactivation and stop/start technology to save fuel. But the twin-turbocharged V-6 engine and magnetic ride control showed off sporting aspirations that seemed almost un-Buick-like.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2017 Chevrolet Bolt 3","caption":"","fileMasterId":168480539,"fileName":"2017-chevrolet-bolt-3.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/168480539/2017-chevrolet-bolt-3.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":4,"text":"<strong>3. 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV</strong><br>\nYou knew the Bolt was coming—it made a splashy debut at last year's Detroit auto show, and the 2017 production model was shown at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas a week ago. It was still important for General Motors chairman Mary Barra to appear in Detroit and introduce the electric car, which is tipped to sell for about $37,000, reduced to around $30,000 after federal subsidies. And speaking of impressive numbers, how about 200 horsepower, 200 miles on a charge, 0 to 60 mph in under seven seconds? (A full charge will take nine hours using the standard on-board charger and a 240-volt outlet, while you can charge enough to get 90 miles of range in a half-hour, Barra said.) The styling is that of a compact (very compact) crossover, featuring SUV-style tall seating positions. Because the battery pack is flat and mounted under the floor, there's 94 cubic feet of passenger room. That's roughly the same as the Honda Fit, a car often praised for its roominess inside. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are on board, as is a 10.2-inch touchscreen infotainment system. Among the available features are a bird's-eye surround-view camera and a wide-angle rearview mirror camera, other features that put us in mind of the Honda Fit. We're really looking forward to trying this out once it goes into production near the end of the year.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2017 Chrysler Pacifica 01","caption":"","fileMasterId":168480548,"fileName":"2017-chrysler-pacifica-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/168480548/2017-chrysler-pacifica-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":5,"text":"<strong> 4. 2017 Chrysler Pacifica</strong><br>\nIt's not the end of the minivan, no matter what the plethora of crossovers on your local streets is telling you.

We never agreed with people who made fun of “family haulers,” and this well-thought-out Pacifica shows that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has as much respect for the family-car shopper as we do. The 3.6-liter V-6 engine makes 287 horsepower and is teamed with a nine-speed automatic transmission, yielding 28 mpg on the highway. A hybrid version comes out in the summer, promising 80 MPGe and 30 miles of range on electric power alone—not bad for a vehicle that seats eight. The pair of ten-inch fold-down screens, with Wi-Fi, will keep back-seat passengers happy, complete with a child-friendly “Are We There Yet?” navigation app. Just kick your foot under either rear sliding door or the back liftgate, and it will open for you, hands-free. There’s much more on the features list, and we predict strong interest from people who previously thought they wanted an SUV.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"Honda is known for innovative packaging, and the Ridgeline is no exception: there’s a locking in-bed trunk, something only Honda has, plus an in-bed audio system.","type":"blockquote"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2017 Honda Ridgeline 02","caption":"","fileMasterId":98279515,"fileName":"2017-honda-ridgeline-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/98279515/2017-honda-ridgeline-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":7,"text":"<strong>5. 2017 Honda Ridgeline</strong><br>\nIt’s not like they were ever gone, but trucks are definitely back in style, as shown by the positive reception the mid-size Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon pickups have received.

The engine is a 3.5-liter V-6 that should make around the same 280 horsepower as in the Honda Pilot SUV. If you think the front half of the Ridgeline looks a lot like the new Pilot, that's because they are built on the same platform and share a lot of parts; in fact, they will be built at the same Alabama plant. Honda is known for innovative packaging, and the Ridgeline is no exception: there’s a locking in-bed trunk, something only Honda has, plus an in-bed audio system. It also has a bed that’s wide enough at 48 inches between wheel wells to allow a sheet of plywood to lay flat.

To win over demanding shoppers in the premium luxury segment, the Lexus had to be a stunner, which it is, and powerful, which it also is, featuring a 5.0-liter V-8 making 467 horsepower and teamed with a new ten-speed automatic transmission. The LC500 reaches into sports-car territory with options like an active rear spoiler and a carbon fiber roof. The enormous mesh grille on this and other Lexus cars is a love-it-or-hate-it proposition, but on this car, it really works well.

Its seats, inspired by those on private jets, adjust to 30 settings and can be had with heating, cooling, and massage features. An optional Revel audio system (we tried it) makes the Continental into one of the world’s finest concert halls. And the Continental features what might be the most interesting use of LED lighting since Disney World: as you approach the car with your key, the LEDs begin to turn on in a hypnotic sequence, first the front, the taillights, then the headlamps, then to light up the pavement around the doors, then, subtly, in the interior.

It will have plug-in hybrid power and Pilot Assist, which manages your steering to keep the car in its lane at speeds up to 80 mph. More than that, it is marking the world debut of large animal detection, which can spot animals such as horses and moose, or more likely in North America, deer, that might get out in front of your vehicle.

It’s the second most popular GMC vehicle after the Sierra pickup, and it also has the highest number of female buyers of any GMC product, at 44 percent.

Many of the changes for 2016 favor people who want to buy a mid-range model rather than spring for the Denali.

The Terrain Denali has the 3.6-liter V-6 with an EPA mpg rating of 16 city/23 highway, while making 301 horsepower. With it, you can tow up to 3,500 pounds.

The only softness comes from a leather pad on the dashboard, surrounded by hard plastic around the center console. There were some rough spots, notably a gaping space in the steering column sheathing around the adjustable steering wheel release knob. My searching fingers plunged right into the gap, and I thought a major piece of plastic trim was missing. But it wasn’t so. They might want to reconsider saving money in that particular area.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<strong>General Motors has a lot to offer in the connectivity/infotainment area, and the Terrain Denali is no exception.</strong> GM’s excellent IntelliLink infotainment screen comes with OnStar and 4G LTE that makes the Terrain into a wireless hot spot.

A hood over the center screen shades it from glare, which is one saving grace.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"The 2016 Terrain has keyless entry, but no push-button start.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

One of the problems with all these controls is that, when they don’t work, you don’t know if it’s user error or something more serious.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

The wheels on all models are new, and the rear-end features LED tail lamps. Inside, the lovely cabin is appointed with LED lighting, trimmed with chrome, and accented with wood. Buttons and switchgear are new as well. Outside and inside, the Touareg is simple and uncluttered, if a bit conservative. There are three powertrains. The 3.6-liter V-6 has to motivate the nearly 4700-pound vehicle (which increases to 5260 pounds in Hybrid form). We would prefer the TDI, which gets 406 pound-feet of torque from the turbo-diesel, direct-injection 3.0-liter V-6. For one thing, it would perform much better when equipped with the towing package that enables the Touareg to pull a 7700-pound trailer. Under best conditions, the TDI has a 765-mile range. Every model, even the Hybrid, has the same advanced eight-speed automatic transmission with manual gear control.

The V-6 Passat has a long list of standard features including rain-sensing wipers, a sunroof, premium touchscreen infotainment with navigation, and a rearview camera. The spacious, tastefully appointed cabin has just the right amount of bright ornamentation; the leather-trimmed seats with micro-fabric inserts are supremely comfortable. In its top trim, the 3.6-liter V-6 model is outfitted with a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, which provides rapid-fire gear changes.

The Jetta 1.8T and TDI have an active shutter in the grille for even less drag and better thermal efficiency. For the value-conscious buyer, the Jetta lineup starts with the 2.0L S with a generous assortment of standard features. This year’s Jetta Sport is a value-package with SE trim and includes the turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, a sport suspension and seats, two-tone 17-inch wheels, fog lamps, and navigation with a rearview camera. It’s offered with five-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. The GLI has 18-inch wheels, a honeycomb grille, LED tail lamps and dual-outlet exhaust; its turbocharged 2.0-liter four produces 210 horsepower. Extreme measures for the lowest drag give the Jetta Hybrid—one of the best of its type that we’ve driven—its own face, and the turbocharged 1.4-liter teams with electric drive for a performance advantage against hybrid competitors.

Post-collision braking, which minimizes the effect of a second impact, is also standard.

Inside, the front seats are ventilated and the driver’s seat has a massage function. The premium audio system uses 10 speakers.

It’s well-equipped and luxurious. The powertrain is sporty, with 200 horsepower coming from the turbocharged direct-injection 2.0-liter four-cylinder and with the dual-clutch automatic gearbox providing nearly instantaneous shifting. But it’s still a front-wheel-drive chassis, which won’t return the same dynamic responses as the BMW. <br><br>The Eos’s chief claim to fame is the hardtop (with incorporated power-operated sunroof) that retracts in 25 seconds. The roof’s five elements neatly sandwich themselves and drop as smoothly as deviled ham. Leave the top up, and the trunk offers 10.5-cubic-feet of storage. As standard equipment, a wind blocker reduces turbulence in the passenger compartment. To counteract roofless vulnerability, the Eos has automatic rollover support, with support elements shooting out of their housings in a quarter-second if a possible rollover or collision is detected. The Eos lineup starts with the Komfort, which has the power sunroof, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and heated front seats. A five-inch touchscreen with navigation are also standard. For 2015, the Final Edition knocks last year’s Sport out of the lineup. It has a more aggressive stance, a lowered, sport-tuned suspension, 18-inch wheels, and black-and-beige leather seats. The Executive indulges with unique wheels, wood interior trim, and a 10-speaker audio system.
