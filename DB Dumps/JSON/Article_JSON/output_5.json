I walked right past them all in search of just a few cars that were cute and actually affordable. (Okay, I admired the expensive ones, too.) I was in luck, because three small cars made their debuts at the show within hours of one another—and they are all going on sale soon. Here's what I found out about them.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h4>Gold: Volkswagen Beetle Convertible</h4>\r\nHere at the Los Angeles show, backed by a Motown-style remix of the old Muzak hit “Sunny,” VW reaffirmed the droptop Beetle’s place in the chick-car pantheon. To be young, preferably with long, blond hair, and driving to the beach was the aesthetic. I’m none of those three things, but I still appreciate the idea of a cute little car that is all about having some fun while you drive.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"What I really like about this car is that VW retains the old-school soft convertible top, not a hard top, so it looks more like the original Beetles. That top goes down in 9.5 seconds and back up in 11.0 seconds, and you can be going as fast as 31 mph while doing so.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"Three Beetle convertibles were shown, each representing a decade. The 50s Edition is black, with a black soft top, a tan interior, seventeen-inch black alloy wheels, and chrome door mirrors. The 60s Edition is denim blue (or it can be white), with black-and-blue leather seats and a black soft top. The 70s Edition has a beige soft top, leather sport seats, and a choice of toffee metallic or gray metallic exterior paint. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"The look of this third-generation Beetle convertible is a bit sportier and more assertive. That’s because VW has lowered, widened, and lengthened the body slightly, gave it a wedgier side profile, and made the iconic bulbous hood longer. The anime-style big-eyed headlights are xenon, and there’s a rear spoiler. So it’s modernized and updated, but just as cute as it ever was, if not more.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"The new Beetle convertible goes on sale in December, with a base price of $24,995. The turbo starts at $31,195. Opt for the Beetle TDI ($27,895) with manual transmission and the two-liter TDI clean diesel, and you’ll be getting an estimated 41 mpg on the highway.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"There are those who call this a “chick car.” I am hereby reclaiming that term on behalf of women and taking it as a compliment that Volkswagen thinks it’s important to make a car women will enjoy.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h4>\r\nSilver: Fiat 500e</h4>\r\nI love everything about Italy, and I am a sucker for a car painted orange. So when a car is painted in Electrico Arancione Perla, no contest. Fiat introduced an electric orange, electric-powered version of its 500 minicar at the show. Even though it was sitting next to two other new 500 models, the  hot Abarth version and the five-door 500L, I only had eyes for the 500e.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"The 500e is going to be a city car, since it’s estimated to have eighty to 100 miles of range on a charge. Its battery-electric powertrain yields a combined estimated 108 mpg-e rating and a charge time that Fiat puts at less than four hours. That could be a workable tradeoff for city dwellers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"The e-Sport package adds a touch of attitude to this cute car, with touches including blacked-out light surrounds and black-and-orange-accented aluminum wheels.  Inside, the 500e’s leatherette seating has a circular-gradient pattern that was inspired by Italian design of the 1960s. Fiat calls the look of this car  “retro futuristic.” ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"You don’t have to buy the 500e in orange, but why wouldn’t you? Okay, it comes in more subdued colors, such as black or white. The 500e goes on sale in the spring. \r\n<h4>\r\nBronze: Chevrolet Spark EV</h4>\r\nChevrolet rolled out its 2014 electric-powered Spark, which goes on sale next summer at a friendly $25,000 entry price with tax incentives. Good for those who want an EV, but won’t be springing for the much pricier Volt, the Spark also has a lot going for it besides price. Start with an optional SAE Combo DC fast charging package, which lets you charge this electric vehicle to 80 percent in twenty minutes. That ought to go a long way to combat range anxiety. GM says this new Spark is the first all-electric vehicle to get that option.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"Inside, you’ll find a pair of seven-inch color LCD screens that show vehicle functions—so you can obsess over battery life—and a host of connectivity functions such as MyLink radio, navigation, Internet radio, Pandora, and Stitcher. Those with an iPhone 4S or 5 can set up to use hands-free Siri on board as well. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"The Spark I saw was in Electric Blue with matching interior accents.  The Spark EV will also come in black, white, silver, and Cappuccino Brown. It’s not the sexiest car I ever saw, but cute?

The app uses data from GasBuddy.com, a website that provides gas prices across the United States and has charts on gas prices over time, trip cost calculators, and fuel saving tips. GasBuddy relies on users to update gas prices, but it seems to be fairly accurate. You can search for gas based on current location or use your city, state, or zip code, and you can search for diesel fuel as well as conventional gasoline. GasBuddy found gas one mile away from me for $3.16 per gallon at a gas station that didn’t show up on Octane’s search. To be fair, it was a gas station I couldn’t go to because it requires a loyalty card, but it seems like GasBuddy’s database still comes out ahead.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>Octane</h4><br/>\r\nThis free app, developed by WEX Inc, a fleet credit card provider, uses real-time data from gas purchases made using their cards. This means that the app only covers gas stations that accept WEX Inc’s cards, but in my test the app still turned up plenty of results. Octane also allows you to choose the search radius and type of fuel you're looking for – including listings for diesel, E85, and compressed natural gas. The app will also give you directions to the gas station of your choice starting from your current location. The cheapest gas Octane found for me was $3.34 per gallon for regular unleaded five miles away. That was about fifty cents per gallon cheaper than the gas station I would have gone to on my way home if left to my own devices.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h4>Diesel Power Fuel Finder</h4><br/>\r\nDiesel Power Fuel Finder focuses exclusively on finding gas stations in your location that sell diesel fuel. Users can specify a search radius, so if you need fuel within five miles, Fuel Finder won’t send you far afield. It doesn’t offer prices or search for other types of fuel, so if you don’t drive a diesel, don’t bother with this one.  Despite the irksome lack of price information, Fuel Finder has one cool feature that sets it apart.

I really don't. The freedom of getting behind the wheel of a car and just taking off can't be compared with anything else. You really feel that you’re in charge: in charge of the car, in charge of the road, and in charge of your life. Why on earth would you want someone else to drive you around when you could do it yourself? It’s so liberating! Obviously, I love driving. I suppose that isn't a particularly original statement for a Detroit native, but it's true. I was a little late getting my driver's license because of that pesky parallel parking, but once I got it, nothing could stop me. It doesn't matter if I have to chauffeur my grandmother to the bank less than a block from our house or drive across town. If I have my green Chrysler LHS--affectionately christened \"Betsy\" by my mother--and some gas in the tank, and if I am somehow able to avoid getting pulled over for driving just a little too fast, I'm good to go.\n\nSince I graduated from the University of Michigan, in April 2012, Betsy has taken me everywhere. She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn’t as dry as a piece of chalk…And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there. Not only am I a bibliophile, but I’m also a self-proclaimed Anglophile who loves Shakespeare and Elizabethan verse and one day plans to see the Houses of Parliament, visit the Tower of London, and, perhaps most important, eat real fish and chips.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n<br>\n<br>\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n<br>\n<br>\nI have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism. I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n<br>\n<br>\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

He belonged to some commune of hippie candle makers, who sold him to me for $100. His name was Odin, and he lived to father two large litters with golden number two, Barley. At one time, I lived with five goldens. That’s when I made the rule that I couldn’t have more dogs than limbs. Every death broke my heart in pieces, so I gave up on dogs for ten years. Eight weeks after I met Tim Jennings, I bought him a Chesapeake Bay retriever for his birthday. We found out later that the dog had been born the day we met. As I drove that little guy to Tim’s house, it suddenly occurred to me that I was about to live with dogs again. We named him Ronald Ambert Wilkins, after a friend of ours who died of cancer. RonDog was our first, but not our last.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"More about Jean","caption":"","fileMasterId":45262380,"fileName":"Bob.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45262380/Bob.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":3264},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2448}},"order":3,"text":"<h2>GCH Irish’s Robert Garcia de Padua (Bob)</h2>\nI don’t mean to brag, but I come from a mighty line of champion Chessies from the Irish kennels in Michigan.

The company announced at the Los Angeles Auto Show that, on January 15, the 2014 Accord Plug-In Hybrid (PHEV) will hit showrooms in New York and California. The new Accord comes with the highest fuel economy rating of any plug-in hybrid on the market, earning an estimated 115 miles per gallon equivalent (MPGe). The PHEV version of the Accord will be priced at $40,570, including destination.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"The Accord Plug-in will have a few exterior styling tweaks to aid with aerodynamics.

","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"Like other plug-ins, the Accord PHEV (which stands for “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle”) has an electric motor, a gasoline engine, and a rechargeable battery. When a driver starts the car up in the morning (assuming the battery has been charged), the car will operate in all-electric mode until the battery charge is depleted, at which point it will switch to gasoline-electric hybrid drive, using a mixture of engine and battery power to maximize the car’s efficiency. At high speeds, or if the driver demands quick acceleration, the car will run on the gasoline engine alone. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>Three-Hour Charge</h4>\r\nThe car’s 6.7-kilowatt-hour battery charges in three hours using a conventional 120-volt wall plug and will give drivers thirteen miles of all-electric range before calling on the car’s gasoline engine for assistance.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Thirteen miles may not seem like much when compared to the Chevrolet Volt’s thirty-eight miles of all-electric range or even the C-Max Energi’s twenty-one miles of electric and gasoline life. The Accord’s three-hour charging time, though, makes it more convenient for quick recharges – especially if you are set up to charge with a 240-volt plug, which decreases charge time to one hour. The C-Max requires seven hours to reach a full charge with a 120-volt plug, while the Volt can take more than ten hours to fully charge using a 120-volt outlet.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>Has the Range Bar Been Permanently Raised?</h4>\r\nIt remains to be seen whether 115 MPGe will become the new brass ring for plug-in hybrid vehicles. Perhaps future PHEVs will reach for an even loftier goal. The actual mileage experienced by drivers of plug-ins varies widely depending on their driving and charging habits, but considering that the most popular plug-in on the market today, the Volt, doesn’t even crack 100 MPGe, it’s safe to say that the bar has been raised. A bonus that should attract Californians is that the car will qualify for single-occupant use of commuter lanes.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h4>Accord Hybrid Coming Soon</h4>\r\nIf wall plugs and all-electric travel are a little too twenty-second century for you, or if you’re not in one of the major markets that will see the plug-in this January, take solace in the fact that the Accord Plug-In will be joined by a more conventional Accord Hybrid in summer 2013. The hybrid will also earn impressive mileage, with 49 mpg in the city and 45 mpg on the highway.

I really don't. The freedom of getting behind the wheel of a car and just taking off can't be compared with anything else. You really feel that you’re in charge: in charge of the car, in charge of the road, and in charge of your life. Why on earth would you want someone else to drive you around when you could do it yourself? It’s so liberating! Obviously, I love driving. I suppose that isn't a particularly original statement for a Detroit native, but it's true. I was a little late getting my driver's license because of that pesky parallel parking, but once I got it, nothing could stop me. It doesn't matter if I have to chauffeur my grandmother to the bank less than a block from our house or drive across town. If I have my green Chrysler LHS--affectionately christened \"Betsy\" by my mother--and some gas in the tank, and if I am somehow able to avoid getting pulled over for driving just a little too fast, I'm good to go.\n\nSince I graduated from the University of Michigan, in April 2012, Betsy has taken me everywhere. She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn’t as dry as a piece of chalk…And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there. Not only am I a bibliophile, but I’m also a self-proclaimed Anglophile who loves Shakespeare and Elizabethan verse and one day plans to see the Houses of Parliament, visit the Tower of London, and, perhaps most important, eat real fish and chips. If only I could drive Betsy \"across the pond…\"","fileMasterId":39801611,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801611/39801611.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Driving Tips","id":1034956,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-driving-tips","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Safety ","id":1023754,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/car-safety","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-11-29T11:46:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45402090/promodeer1.jpg","fileMasterId":45402090,"fileName":"promodeer1.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-11-27T07:56:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/45361752/IMG-6607-622-x-350.jpg","fileMasterId":45361752,"fileName":"IMG-6607-622-x-350.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}},"pages":[{"id":245646,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Deer hunting season, in full swing right now, is a temporary situation, but live deer are a year-round concern for motorists.

Trust us. One of our colleagues at <em>Automobile Magazine</em> was in an accident with a deer a few weeks ago. He had his seatbelt on, and we’re happy to report that he came away unscathed (apparently, the deer did, too). However, the Mazda he was driving is another story, as you can see from the photos in our image gallery.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>2.</strong>\t<strong>Be alert and be vigilant in the spring and fall and at dusk and dawn.</strong><br/>\nDeer are always around, but deer-vehicle collisions are particularly prevalent during mating season, which occurs between October and December. They also tend to do much of their traveling either early in the morning or during the evening when the skies are dark and drivers have less visibility. When you're driving at night, State Farm suggests you turn your high beams on so you can see the whole road.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>3.</strong>\t<strong>If you’ve seen one, you’ll eventually see them all.</strong><br/>\nDeer are not solitary creatures. They travel in herds and, frequently, in single file. If you see one deer, depress your brake pedal and slow down, in case there are more deer waiting to cross the road.<br/></p>\n\n<p><strong>4.</strong>\t<strong>Don’t touch your horn or your lights.</strong><br/>\nI’ve heard some people say you’re supposed to sound the horn and flash your lights when you see a deer, but the Michigan Deer Crash Coalition says that using your horn or flashing your high beams like a strobe light won’t make the deer go away. <br/></p>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<strong>5.

Or the Bible, if you’re picky about attribution. Whether or not we like to admit it, that includes driving. Many of us will reach a point when it is no longer safe for us to drive, and before it happens to us, we’re likely to have to navigate the issue with parents or older relatives.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I really don't. The freedom of getting behind the wheel of a car and just taking off can't be compared with anything else. You really feel that you’re in charge: in charge of the car, in charge of the road, and in charge of your life. Why on earth would you want someone else to drive you around when you could do it yourself? It’s so liberating! Obviously, I love driving. I suppose that isn't a particularly original statement for a Detroit native, but it's true. I was a little late getting my driver's license because of that pesky parallel parking, but once I got it, nothing could stop me. It doesn't matter if I have to chauffeur my grandmother to the bank less than a block from our house or drive across town. If I have my green Chrysler LHS--affectionately christened \"Betsy\" by my mother--and some gas in the tank, and if I am somehow able to avoid getting pulled over for driving just a little too fast, I'm good to go.\n\nSince I graduated from the University of Michigan, in April 2012, Betsy has taken me everywhere. She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn’t as dry as a piece of chalk…And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there. Not only am I a bibliophile, but I’m also a self-proclaimed Anglophile who loves Shakespeare and Elizabethan verse and one day plans to see the Houses of Parliament, visit the Tower of London, and, perhaps most important, eat real fish and chips. If only I could drive Betsy \"across the pond…\"","fileMasterId":39801611,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801611/39801611.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Teenagers","id":1034773,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/kids-in-the-car/teenagers","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Safety ","id":1023754,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/car-safety","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Kids in the Car","id":1034769,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[{"articleId":332311,"name":"article0","promoImage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2012-12-13T12:34:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Driver's License","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42222388/White-300.jpg","fileMasterId":42222388,"fileName":"White-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"promoTeaser":"My heart belongs to things that go vroom.

Michelin hasn’t released pricing on this tire yet, but it is almost certain that drivers who don’t need or want thrilling performance from their cars will be perfectly happy with a cheaper tire.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<h4>More of a Risk-Averse Type?</h4>Where the Michelin product made its best case – especially for the risk-averse, safety-minded driver – was in the braking distance test.

In an emergency, that’s the difference between a collision and a near miss.

The warranty’s length will differ depending on the manufacturer. Some warranties will start from the in-service date, or the date that its first owner drove it home from the dealership. Seeing the words “in-service date” should be a hint to direct your attention to the odometer immediately. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"Since you’re buying used, the car will have miles on it already, meaning you’re likely to exhaust the mileage limit of the warranty before the age limit.

This means that the number of miles that the car has accumulated prior to the time it came into your possession don’t count against you.

Not only are all cars and their respective warranties different, but the benefits and terms of the programs vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. To give you a sample what CPO programs have to offer, here are two examples of two very different manufacturers with different, but attractive, programs. \r\n\t\r\n<h4>Example 1: Kia</h4>\r\n•\tTo qualify to be a certified pre-owned car, a Kia vehicle must be five years old or less, have fewer than 60,000 miles on the engine, and pass a 150-point inspection. Each of the vehicles comes with a ten-year, 100,000-mile limited powertrain warranty that covers the repair of major vehicle parts, like the engine and transmission. In addition to the powertrain warranty, you can elect to extend you coverage benefits and the your length coverage up to an addition 100,000 miles by choosing one of four protection plans. With the plans also come rental car, towing, and travel coverage (should your car breakdown when you’re 100 miles away from home) and financing.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"•\tTo help you with maintenance visits, Kia also offers two servicing plans to cover oil changes, brake adjustments, tire rotations, and preventive care. The service plans also come with Cross Country Motor Club membership.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"•\tDepending on the state you live in, coverage plans for tire and wheel replacement or repair are also available. They are three, four, or five year plans that cover up to $40 in tire repairs. Based on the plan you choose, you can either receive up to $200 in tire or wheel replacement and a lifetime maximum of $1,200 for repairs or replacements or a $5,000 lifetime maximum for repairs or replacements.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<h4>Example 2: Mercedes-Benz</h4>\r\n•\tMercedes-Benz CPOs are six years old or less, have less than 75,000 miles, and are required to pass a 164-point inspection process. If the car is less than four years old or has less than 50,000 miles on the odometer, it will still be under the original, new car warranty. After the car turns four or reaches 50,000 miles, the certified pre-owned limited warranty begins and runs for a year or up to 100,000 miles, whichever comes first. If the car is four years or older at the time of certified purchase, then the one-year, or 100,000-mile warranty starts the day you buy it. Like Kia, Mercedes-Benz allows you to extend your CPO warranty, but for either one year, or 120,000 miles; or two years, or 135,000 miles. If you choose to sell your car to another person, the extended warranty can be transferred.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"•\tTwenty-four-hour roadside assistance is also part of Mercedes-Benz’s CPO program. Mercedes-Benz also has travel coverage that reimburses you for expenses incurred over three days in the event that Mercedes breaks down on you while you and the car are away from home. <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"•\tPurchasing a Mercedes-Benz CPO also entitles you to exchange it for another CPO vehicle if you are not satisfied with your first purchase. The exchange must occur within seven days or 500 miles. You can exchange your car for a CPO of equal or greater value, but you will be required to pay the difference.<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"<h4>Odds Are in Your Favor</h4>\r\nThanks to the proliferation of CPO programs, a dealership is a more user-friendly place than ever to shop for a used vehicle.

At the age of eighteen, she bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, Jennings went to Chrysler’s test track where she worked as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, she was hired as a writer at <em>Car and Driver</em> magazine when she was laid off her Chrysler job, and in 1985 she left to establish <em>Automobile Magazine</em> with David E.

This one just lets you share your location with specific people for a fixed period so you can keep an eye on a driver. And the location tracking is excellent.

I started touring with a band along with my older brother, Ryan, when I was still in high school, and in all I have put in a little over ten years of touring. Eventually we were in a band named Thunderbirds Are Now! We played many festivals including SXSW, CMJ, and Pitchfork, toured all over the country and all over Europe, went to Australia, were in a lot of magazines, and had an exciting time. We spent thousands of hours inside a 15-passenger red Ford Econoline van we bought that we called Old Magent. That was where we had our down time. We spent more time in the van than we did playing the shows. When we toured outside the country, we had drivers. My strongest memory of that is being picked up in a Mercedes Sprinter van by someone we had never seen before and being driven through deep snow from Germany to Sweden—a 15-hour drive—through the mountains at high speed. Everyone in the band wrote final messages to our families and put them in our pockets just in case.\n\n\nTouring with a band is very scary but also very fun. A lot of weird and new things happened in my life, but they are great memories I'll never forget, and it was time well spent living a dream that came true. But all good things come to an end. You're up every night, and it just gets hard. I was lucky that my father was a musician and built a recording studio in our basement, and he also shot a lot of videos. I have been recording my own music and making stop-animation video since I was a young kid. After leaving the band, I went to Washtenaw Community College to study videography and won a couple of awards—Most Creative two years in a row, and Best in Show. I was doing freelance post-production video editing when I met Jean Jennings, and we instantly clicked. She likes music, I like music, and we just \"get\" each other. I've had a very, very strange route to where I am now. I'm happy that I can settle in with Jean Knows Cars and live a normal life but still with a creative outlook.\n\nHere's an <a href=\"http://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2013/07/24/detroit-proud-scott-allen/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Scott</a> by CBS Detroit in July 2013:","fileMasterId":39801554,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801554/39801554.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1733,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"scott.allen@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]},{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

You probably already describe things at home: “Look, Molly, this book is red. It has a green duck on the cover. See?” Transfer that skill over to the car: “Look, Molly, I am pulling the car in to a parking space between those two white lines. I am going very slowly and watching to make sure there are no cars and no people so everybody will be safe… See how the man wants to cross the street? I am stopping, and now I am waving my hand to let him go. He’s smiling! That’s nice.” Suddenly Molly is sharing in the process and being taught about what should be in a driver’s head: paying attention to the tasks and making good choices to protect the safety of others.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>2.\tTalk about the signs, directions, and road types you encounter.</h4> Perhaps you already say things like, “That’s a stop sign. It means I have to stop for a minute and look to see if other cars are coming.” Or perhaps your child has asked about road signs. You can go beyond that to talk about more advanced topics such as the no-passing lane, the cameras at some intersections, and the way a traffic roundabout works. You can point out the differences in roads from a country dirt road to an Interstate and talk about the way you handle going into a broad turn, merging onto a highway, and moving out of the way for emergency vehicles.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"You could also tie your description to choices you make while you drive: “Look, Molly, that car is going really fast. I am going to go to the right lane—this part of the road between the lines—because the rule is that cars can go past me in the left lane—this part of the road over here. I wish he would go a little more slowly but we will be safe and stay on our side so he can get past safely.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>3.\tAsk questions that help your child learn safety decision making.</h4> When you enter a parking lot, ask your child, “Do you think we should park over here, where there aren’t very many cars? Or do you think we should go up close to the store even though there are lots of people walking? What should I do to make it safer for everybody?” Or ask, “When it’s snowing this hard, what do you think the joggers should do? How can I drive so they are safer? What would be the safest thing?” Open-ended questions can lead to a good discussion of safety rules and can also make driving more interesting for kids.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Another thing to consider is that children ride in cars with lots of people who aren't you: babysitters, caregivers, other parents during outings and play dates, grandparents, even (gulp!) older siblings who drive. It's up to you to make sure you and your child are on the same page and your rules are clearly understood. Then your kid will know what to do when climbing into someone else's car.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h4>\r\n4.\tInvolve your child in the maintenance and repair process.</h4> If you take your car in for an oil change, bring your child with you and look at the checklist together.  (“Look, Charlie, our car has five quarts of oil in it.  The workers just drained it out and put in clean, fresh oil to help all the parts move smoothly. Do you know how big a quart is? It’s this much!”) If you take your car in for a repair or after an accident, involve your child in the process. Let him or her take some before-and-after photos, look up information about the repair on the Internet, and let him or her meet the mechanic and glimpse the work being done whenever possible. I would especially suggest this for girls—who are less likely to be included in this kind of discussion and will then reach age sixteen at a disadvantage next to more mechanically savvy boys.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h4>\r\n5.\tModel appropriate behavior, attitude, and choices.</h4> This is probably the most important thing to do when children are in your car. Actually, you should model appropriate behavior no matter who is riding with you. Be a thoughtful, caring, and rational person when you drive. Anger, impatience, and selfishness may not be officially prohibited by law when you drive, but they’re dangerous.

Make sure he or she walks into that eventual driver education class with a solid foundation in how a grownup looks, acts, and thinks when behind the wheel. It’s only a matter of a few years before “Look both ways” elicits an eye roll.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Caroline Ashton, a sophomore at Guerin Catholic High School in Noblesville, Indiana, chose an online course over a traditional one because her extracurricular activities didn’t leave time for the intensive in-person programs offered in her area. “Most of my friends are doing it online, too,” she says. “You can do it on your own time.” ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Online courses allow busy students to complete segments when they have time between school, sports practice, student government, volunteering, and whatever else high-schoolers have to do to impress admissions officers these days. Ashton fills up her calendar with soccer-related commitments and balked at the traditional course offered in her area this summer, which would have taken up six hours a day every day for a week.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>Cost Savings for Today's Overbilled Parent</h4>\r\nAdding to their charm, online courses are often much, much cheaper than the classroom versions. Many online offerings cost less than $100, and some are as little as $10 to $20. In contrast, traditional driver ed courses can cost several hundred dollars or more. That math should be a no-brainer for most parents, especially considering the myriad of other costs associated with having a teen driver in the household.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Most of the courses include instruction in the form of video, text, and interactive elements, along with several quizzes and a final comprehensive test. Ashton’s course allows her to download study guides before tests so she can review material, much as she would be able to do in a classroom setting. Students still have to earn an acceptable score on the online tests to pass the class, and the courses are designed to take time to complete, so students can’t blow through all thirty hours of information in one weekend.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h4>You Don't Avoid the \"Student Driver\" Car That Easily</h4>\r\nTeens who opt for an online course still have to endure a certain amount of in-person instruction before they get the keys to the kingdom – or the family Honda, as the case may be. These requirements vary by state (and not all states allow online driver education for first-time license earners). In Ashton’s case, Indiana will require her to schedule six sessions with a driving instructor before she earns her learner’s permit, after which she will have to log fifty hours of driving (including ten hours of night driving) with a parent before she can take her driving test.\r\nTeens can’t just take any old course they find through Google, either. Courses must be approved by the state before they can be taken in place of traditional driver ed. Check with your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles (or equivalent body) to find courses that are approved for first-time drivers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h4>States' Rules Differ</h4>\r\nDriver’s license requirements vary by state, and in some cases no formal instruction is needed for teenagers to obtain a license. Online courses, with their low cost-to-information ratio, could offer some peace of mind for parents that live in one of those states and are worried about sending their teens out on the roads without any expert instruction.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<h4>Kids' Temperaments Differ, Too</h4>\r\nAlso worth considering when contemplating an online course: your teen’s tendency to procrastinate. Ashton has been working on her course since August, and isn’t yet halfway through. She conceded that despite the convenience, she regrets not taking the course in person, saying (with just a hint of frustration), “I would have been done by now!”","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:06:17.163-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865577164 }} },{ "_id":226318,"title":"Green Cars: Deciphering the Choices","subTitle":"","slug":"green-cars-how-to-decipher","promoTitle":"Green Cars: Deciphering the Choices","promoTeaserSmall":"Hybrid?

Maybe one of them is just what you're looking for.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<h4>Gasoline/Electric Hybrid</h4>\r\nThis is probably what you think of when you think “hybrid.” These cars have a fuel tank, a gas engine, a battery (typically nickel-hydride or lithium-ion), and an electric motor. There are several different ways to engineer a hybrid vehicle, but a typical hybrid will run using the battery and electric motor while the car is stopped or traveling at low speeds and then rely on the gas and conventional engine to travel at higher speeds or when more power is required. Many hybrids use regenerative braking technology to capture energy from braking and store the energy in the battery for later use.\r\n<ul>\r\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>:<br/>\r\n1.\tFord C-Max<br/>\r\n2.\tHonda Insight<br/>\r\n3.\tToyota Prius<br/></p>\r\n</ul>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h4>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle</h4>\nPlug-in hybrids are electric vehicles for the range anxious. Plug them into the wall at night, and when you drive away in the morning, you’ll have a store of energy that will allow you to go some distance without engaging the engine at all. These batteries are bigger and heavier than those that power gas/electric hybrids, but they also allow the car to operate at or near full power without engaging the engine. The Chevrolet Volt can travel thirty-eight miles before it starts using gas. Ford’s new C-Max plug-in hybrid can make it twenty-one miles on battery power alone. Once you run out of range, the engine takes over and powers the electric motor to keep the car moving.\n<ul>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>:<br/>\n1.\tChevrolet Volt<br/>\n2.\tFord C-Max Energi<br/>\n3.\tToyota Prius Plug-In Hybrid<br/></p>\n</ul>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>Electric Vehicle</h4>\nNo safety net here. These cars rely exclusively on battery power to operate. They take several hours to charge fully, and most have a range of around 100 miles (less if you’re driving fast or using air conditioning; the ideal conditions are city traffic on a sunny spring day). Once the battery runs out, you’re out of luck until the car has had some quality time with a plug in its charging port.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"On the bright side? Zero emissions, negligible energy costs (a full charge might add a couple of dollars to your electric bill), and federal tax incentives make the cars more attractive.

That’s how I became a contributor to Jean Knows Cars.  Well into a lovely dinner party, I received a most unlikely suggestion:  “You should write about cars from your perspective – a 4’11” single mother with a ten-year-old minivan who drives around three overactive children and a Bernese Mountain Dog.  Theatre, swimming, hockey, lacrosse, figure skating, field hockey… You love to tell stories. Tell them about cars.”  I suggested that my background possibly lacked necessary expertise – B.A. from Duke in art history and medieval/Renaissance studies; Fellow of the American Academy in Rome; Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in medieval architecture --  nothing about cars there!  My friend persisted, “You may be an art historian, but you are also a hockey mother who can whistle like a trucker, a runner, and a lover of good food, wine and the written word.”\n\nI pondered.  The auto industry and I did have a long, if tangential, history.  I did a stint as an executive secretary to the president of a car dealership and spent fifteen years negotiating a dual identity as an academic and as auto company spouse.  I have always suffered from car envy, particularly acutely when I lived in Europe.  (As envy and lust are amongst the seven deadly sins, I’m in trouble.)

Audi had also cleared the area of pedestrians carefully, because the car and sensors are, after all, prototypes.

Humans may not be ready to trust technology this much, parking structures lack the infrastructure, and so on. But parts of this technology will certainly be working their way into new cars slowly.

Treat the car the way you want them to treat it, inside and out.</strong> Do you blame the mess inside your car on your kids? Perhaps, like baby weight, that excuse no longer works when your child is in seventh grade. Having a lot of loose things rolling around—books, CDs, shoes, or whatever you stash in your car—is unsafe, since these objects can become projectiles in an accident or a sudden stop. A car without adequate washer fluid, or caked in dirt that makes it hard to see out the windows, can pose safety hazards as well. Besides, it’s not conducive to quality of life. Get your kids used to the idea that things get put away in the trunk or storage area, and the car gets washed. You can even add it to their chore lists. Brilliant!</ol>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<ol>\r\n<strong>2. Take a cooperative attitude toward other drivers.</strong> Make constructive and positive comments about the driving process in front of the kids.

Include your middle schooler in maintenance and repair issues.</strong> I remember first learning about oil changes and tire rotations when I actually owned a car. I may have been unusually dense, of course. Show your middle schooler what an owner's manual is and what’s inside it. Let him or her show <em>you</em> how to look up maintenance information on your car online. Go to the oil change place together; involve your child in picking out new tires. If there’s an accident to deal with, take out the paperwork and explain the insurance deductible and the estimate process.</ol>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"<ol>\r\n<strong>4. Pre-teach the rules of the road.</strong> Be AP Driving School for your child.

Nearly any child aged ten and up is ready to start working on that body of knowledge. You can go even further and get your <a href= http://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,1607,7-127-1642-103522--,00.html rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">state’s driving manual</a> for your curious tween to look at.</ol>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"<ol>\r\n<strong>5. Encourage enthusiasm about cars and driving.</strong> I’m sure many a middle schooler is sitting in the back of a classroom right now, drawing a hot rod on a sheet of lined paper. Well, these days perhaps they are drawing them on tablet computers, but the idea is the same. If you have such a child, you can share in his or her interest and spend some fun times together. Go to races, collector-car auctions, and car museums together. Play some of the nonviolent driving games you can find on the Internet and in the App Store. Find adult mentors who like to work on cars. Save up to send your child to an advanced driving school later on. Your child will be driving for decades, but you only have a few more years in which he or she will look to you for help exploring personal interests like these.</ol>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"Heaven knows, we need more drivers who are interested, engaged, and take the task seriously.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Maintenance and Ownership","id":1034958,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-maintenance","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1023763,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos/qa","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"All Videos","id":1023756,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-01-16T10:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42863836/Service-Manager-300.jpg","fileMasterId":42863836,"fileName":"Service-Manager-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-01-16T10:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42106505/Service-Manager-622.jpg","fileMasterId":42106505,"fileName":"Service-Manager-622.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":351},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-01-16T10:57:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42106439/Service-Manager-980.jpg","fileMasterId":42106439,"fileName":"Service-Manager-980.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":321},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":977}}},"pages":[{"id":446466,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"When you drive your car in to a repair facility, whether an independent shop or a dealership's service department, do you know how to speak the language?

The ELR will go on sale in early 2014.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"The <strong>2014 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray</strong> was (finally) revealed after a long buildup of expectations, and the car was mobbed by journalists throughout the media preview. There is no doubt it will be even more mobbed when the show opens to the public this weekend. This is no minor update – the seventh-generation Corvette is almost entirely new, using only a handful of parts from the previous generation. Featuring Chevrolet’s new 6.2-liter LT1 V-8 engine, it is the most powerful Corvette ever. Luckily for fuel-conscious buyers, technologies like active fuel management and variable valve timing mean it is also expected to be the most efficient Corvette ever. The Corvette Stingray will go on sale in the third quarter of 2013.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<strong>Ford</strong> unveiled its new truck concept, the <strong>Atlas,</strong> one of only a few concepts that hadn’t been teased before the show. The Atlas is likely a preview of the 2015 F-150, and it showcases technology and improved efficiency. The concept makes use of an EcoBoost powertrain and start/stop technology (which is disabled while towing), which Ford says could lead to up to twenty percent in fuel savings. Other features include LED headlights and taillights and a 360-degree point-of-view camera.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"In case you missed the wave of publicity around its \"rebranding\" as The Lincoln Motor Company, Ford's luxury brand, <strong>Lincoln,</strong> has a new image and a new flagship, the MKZ. Here at Detroit, the focus was all on its crossover concept, the <strong>MKC.</strong> The MKC is a glimpse at what will be Lincoln’s first offering to the ever-expanding small utility segment. This concept, the smallest Lincoln ever, features a sloping roofline, a panoramic roof, and Lincoln’s new “split wing” grille. Lincoln says an eventual production car will feature unique powertrains and deliver a luxury experience. Lincoln hasn't named a timeline for a production version.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<strong>Honda</strong> also used the Detroit show to unveil its small-SUV concept (shown at top of the page), cleverly dubbed the <strong>Urban SUV Concept.</strong> Like the Lincoln MKC, the Urban SUV Concept is a new entry in the small-SUV segment. Unlike the more luxury-oriented Lincoln, Honda's new model will be positioned below the popular CR-V in Honda’s lineup: fuel efficient and targeted at young buyers. Honda says a production version of the car will come to the U.S. market in 2014. It will be manufactured alongside the Fit at a new plant to be built in Mexico.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"Of course, these five cars are only the tip of the iceberg. There was plenty to be seen at the show’s home in the Cobo Center, from performance thoroughbreds to electric city cars and everything in between. If you’re in Detroit, make a trip downtown once the show opens to the public on January 19. If not, come back for more of our coverage later in the week.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":32476,"make":"Chevrolet","model":"Corvette","year":2014},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":20163,"make":"Ford","model":"F-150","year":2013},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":7},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:06:29.725-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455865589727 }} },{ "_id":334555,"title":"EV Charging: Brilliant Induction","subTitle":"","slug":"ev-charging-brilliant-induction","promoTitle":"EV Charging: Brilliant Induction","promoTeaserSmall":"Imagine a future where a charging infrastructure is everywhere so you don't have to worry about it.","promoTeaser":"Imagine a future where a charging infrastructure is everywhere so you don't have to worry about it.","keywords":["EV Charging"],"metaTitle":"EV Charging: Brilliant Induction - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["Consumer Electronics Show","CES","Qualcomm battery charging","Qualcomm Halo charging","Qualcomm charging for electric cars","Rolls-Royce 102EX","Rolls-Royce experimental electric car","inductive charger","inductive charging for cars","Rolls-Royce at CES","Rolls-Royce at Consumer Electronics Show"],"metaDescription":"EV Charging: Brilliant Induction.

Qualcomm Halo (a wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm, which you may or may not know as the company that makes the processor in your smartphone) showed it off on the Rolls-Royce Phantom 102EX, an experimental EV, and defied all of these assumptions. This drool-inducing vehicle no longer had its engine. In its place was a state-of-the-art battery tricked out with Qualcomm Halo’s wireless inductive charging technology. Built into the car’s underbelly was a Halo battery receiver. Charging it was a simple matter of parking – not even all that precisely – the car over the charger.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>That's Right, Charge Just by Parking on Top of the Charger</h4>\nThe idea is that these chargers will be everywhere someday. You’ll have one in your garage. They will be found at stoplights, in parking garages, taxi stands, and wherever cars tend to stop for a few minutes or a few hours. Even when you park on top of one briefly, your car will pick up a charge. If you stop for only a minute, it will get an incremental top-off; if you park for hours, it will get more. Best of all, Qualcomm claims that even this big Rolls-Royce can go 125 miles on one charge from the pad.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h4>Although, Metal = Kryptonite</h4>\nUnless, that is, something metal drops onto the charging pad.

In the car (and on a wall display for demonstration purposes at CES) there is a feedback display to let you know if metal has been detected. So, if a coin, a tin can, or any other metal object is on the pad, the in-car display will light up to indicate heat, and the charging system will be shut off.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"Unfortunately, this car is just a demonstration of the technology.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-01-23T10:50:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Toyota Furia Concept","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46378710/Toyota-Furia-300.jpg","fileMasterId":46378710,"fileName":"Toyota-Furia-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-01-22T16:33:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46369254/toyota-furia.jpg","fileMasterId":46369254,"fileName":"toyota-furia.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-01-23T10:47:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"Detroit Auto Show","title":"Acura NSX Concept","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46378641/Acura-NSX-Concept","fileMasterId":46378641,"fileName":"Acura-NSX-Concept","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":446652,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h4>Editor in Chief Jean Jennings Picks:</h4>\nControversial: Toyota Furia Concept (top of page)<br>\nSexy: 2013 Maserati Quattroporte<br>\nGorgeous.

DriveSmart will automatically route calls through a hands-free Bluetooth setup if one is in use, so drivers don’t have to be completely out of touch. The version of the app that automatically detects driving (DriveSmart Plus) costs $4.99 per month; DriveSmart Basic which does not automatically detect driving (requiring users to self-report), is free and comes pre-installed on T-Mobile’s Sidekick 4G, the LG Optimus T, and the Samsung Galaxy S 4G, Gravity Smart, and Exhibit 4G.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h4>Verizon Safely Go</h4>\r\nVerizon’s safe driving app will allow drivers to use up to three “driving apps” (navigation, music, etc) and receive texts and calls from up to three pre-designated contacts while driving, but will block notifications from all other texts and send an auto-response explaining that the user is driving.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Reviews","id":1023765,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos/car-reviews","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"All Videos","id":1023756,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-01T11:27:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Nissan Resonance","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42293159/Resonance-300.jpg","fileMasterId":42293159,"fileName":"Resonance-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":167},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":298}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-01T11:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42291830/NissanRenn622x350.jpg","fileMasterId":42291830,"fileName":"NissanRenn622x350.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-04T05:42:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Nissan Resonance","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/46640100/Resonance-980.jpg","fileMasterId":46640100,"fileName":"Resonance-980.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":977}}},"pages":[{"id":453972,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"The Nissan Resonance was one of the more polarizing concept vehicles at the Detroit auto show.

Unfortunately, the two are a dangerous combination.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"At sixteen, there are a lot of risky temptations: dope, booze, goofy friends, drag racing, and the suddenly devastating appeal of the opposite sex are just a few. But, as a doting helicopter parent with ready access to statistics, it is the temptation to text from behind the wheel that puts me in a cold panic. Ignoring the ping of a cell phone text -- even for the fifteen-minute drive to school -- is difficult for a teen. In their world, not answering a text immediately has dire consequences. That trash-texting hottie will move on if you ignore her sext for more than five minutes. Parties get planned, decisions made, and friendships evolve in that amount of time. I’m a parent, so I’m congenitally unable to understand any of this, but I have all this on good authority. I’m assuming that’s why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that 58 percent of high school seniors report they have recently texted or e-mailed while driving, and why an AT&T Wireless survey found that 75 percent of teens say texting and driving is common among them – even though I’m sure their parents warned them against it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h4>The Danger Is Obvious</h4>Texting while driving is as dangerous – perhaps more dangerous – than drinking and driving. The Virginia Tech Transportation Institute says that drivers who text are twenty-three times more likely to get in an accident.

Cole actually welcomed the idea, especially if the tool I used would send an automatic text informing his friends he was driving and would get back to them at a stoplight.

Know Your Metropolis</h4>\r\nThe report compiled data from 498 communities of varying sizes, and predictably, there’s more traffic in New York City than in Omaha. Each metropolis has its own planning time index (PTI), which indicates the amount of time drivers should allow for a trip if they only want to be late about one day per month. (For the less dedicated, there is a separate PTI that tells you how early to leave if you only want to be late one day per week.) Washington, D.C., has the highest PTI: no surprise for those of us who have spent time on the Beltway. Washingtonians need to allow two hours and fifty-one minutes for a thirty-minute drive during peak hours. That’s almost six times more commuting, for you non-math types. Of course, if you leave three hours early for work every day, you’ll be two and a half hours early some days (the day after Christmas, perhaps) and just on time other days (the morning after a blizzard, for instance).","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":47820033,"fileName":"Morning_Commute_Chart.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/47820033/Morning_Commute_Chart.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":621}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"","fileMasterId":42877196,"fileName":"Congestion_Tables_622.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/42877196/Congestion_Tables_622.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":621}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":4,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>2. Avoid Peak Hours</h4>\r\nThe Transportation Institute suggests that drivers avoid traveling during peak traffic hours if possible. In Detroit, Jean Knows Cars’ home metropolitan area, drivers making a thirty-minute trip during rush hour would need to allow for an hour and thirty-six minutes of travel. That same trip made during “free flow” periods, when congestion has cleared out, would take just thirty-five minutes.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"Sometimes you don’t have a choice about when to travel, but if your place of work has flexible hours or allows telecommuting, it might be worth it to wait until after rush hour to make the trip to work. This serves the double purpose of reducing the number of cars on the road when traffic is at its worst and saving you from spending your commute driving more slowly than you could walk.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h4>3. Check for Delays before You Leave</h4>\r\nSince no one wants to be the person who leaves hours early every single day on the off chance that there’s a logjam, it makes sense to check a local radio station or even Google Maps before you leave the house to see if there are any backups you should avoid. If there’s a particular route that is consistently clogged during rush hour, try to plan around it. And if you have one of the many cars with available traffic notifications, the cost of the subscription is worth it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"<h4>4. Carpool</h4>\r\nCarpooling is a win-win: if your area has HOV lanes, a carpool buddy will allow you to bypass the worst of the congestion. If your area doesn’t have HOV lanes, you’ll have a few people to split the cost of gas with, and some conversation partners in case you get stuck in gridlock. Plus, you’ll get good karma for taking a couple of cars and their emissions off the road during peak hours.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<h4>5. Go with the Flow</h4>\nAt the end of the day, unless you’re a city planner or a traffic engineer, you can’t do much to solve the traffic problem. So if your best efforts to avoid clogged roadways fail, do what I do: have a dance party in your car. Or call an old friend to catch up (from a hands-free device, of course). Or play the license plate game. You may be stuck in traffic, but that’s no reason you can’t enjoy yourself.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"What do you do to stay relaxed and calm during heavy traffic?

After three years on the East Coast, I’m happy to be back in a place where the speed limit is treated more as a guideline than a rule.","fileMasterId":39801539,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801539/39801539.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[3002,70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Tech News","id":1034781,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/car-tech-news","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-08T12:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"EyesFree Siri","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43064690/EyesFree-BMW-300.jpg","fileMasterId":43064690,"fileName":"EyesFree-BMW-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":170},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-08T12:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"EyesFree Siri","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43064948/2013-Acura-ILX-2.0L-622.jpg","fileMasterId":43064948,"fileName":"2013-Acura-ILX-2.0L-622.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":620}}},"pages":[{"id":455051,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Good news for iPhone users who just can’t bring themselves to ignore texts while they’re driving: Honda has announced that it will make Siri integration available in the 2013 Honda Accord and the Acura RDX and ILX.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

It doesn't matter if I have to chauffeur my grandmother to the bank less than a block from our house or drive across town. If I have my green Chrysler LHS--affectionately christened \"Betsy\" by my mother--and some gas in the tank, and if I am somehow able to avoid getting pulled over for driving just a little too fast, I'm good to go.\n\nSince I graduated from the University of Michigan, in April 2012, Betsy has taken me everywhere. She has been my steadfast companion on trips to buy more supplies for various sewing projects, leisurely drives along Jefferson/Lakeshore Drive in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, and frequent jaunts to the bookstore to buy yet another copy of Hamlet, a 500-plus-page book on Elizabeth I, or a good book on British history that isn’t as dry as a piece of chalk…And, yes, there is a little bit of theme there. Not only am I a bibliophile, but I’m also a self-proclaimed Anglophile who loves Shakespeare and Elizabethan verse and one day plans to see the Houses of Parliament, visit the Tower of London, and, perhaps most important, eat real fish and chips. If only I could drive Betsy \"across the pond…\"","fileMasterId":39801611,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/39801611/39801611.jpg","socialLinks":[],"websiteIds":[70005,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Features","id":1023749,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Style","id":1023753,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/features/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-13T12:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Retirement Car","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48288981/Lawson-300.jpg","fileMasterId":48288981,"fileName":"Lawson-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-13T12:21:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Retirement Car","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43476125/Lawson-and-Patriot.jpg","fileMasterId":43476125,"fileName":"Lawson-and-Patriot.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":350},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}}},"pages":[{"id":455491,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"When my mom announced that she was going to retire, she showed me the annuity information she downloaded from her employer's website and asked me which monthly annuity payout I thought she should take.

A monthly payment of $300 to $400 for a purchase wouldn’t be feasible, but a monthly lease payment of $150 or $200 would be, especially if she leased her next car from Chrysler, a company that has a proven track record with her. “I’ve had success with leases in the past, and that was when I actually did have a commute,” Mom said. “The mileage limit shouldn’t pose a problem now, and it will allow me to be prudent with my car expenses.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":19,"text":"I dragged my mother off car shopping the second weekend in January.

This diesel is different, though. If your opinion of diesel is stuck in the past, here are five reasons you should give it a second look.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h4>1. New, Better Technology</h4>\nDiesel has been rebranded as clean diesel, and it has the credentials to prove it. Not only does the new Cruze diesel engine emit 90 percent less nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions than the previous generation of diesel engines, but Robert Bosch LLC, a big provider of clean diesel technology, says that diesel engines in general produce 25 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than an equivalent gasoline engine.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h4>2. More Efficient, Longer Range</h4>\nGasoline engines only use about 30 percent of their energy to power a car, which isn’t really all that efficient. Diesel engines convert 45 to 50 percent of their energy to power, so there’s less wasted potential. This translates to good fuel economy, especially at cruising speeds. Many diesel sedans on sale now earn between 40 and 43 mpg on the highway, easily achieving a goal that gasoline-powered cars have to strive for.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Good fuel economy also means good range. With the Cruze’s expected 42-mpg highway rating and 15.6-gallon fuel tank, it could go well over 600 miles on a fill-up. Volkswagen and Audi’s various TDI models all have similar figures. By way of comparison, a 2013 Cruze with a traditional 1.8-liter gasoline engine and a manual transmission earns 36 mpg on the highway and, at that rate, would go about 100 fewer miles between fill-ups at cruising speed.  ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h4>3. Plenty of Fun to Drive</h4>\r\nAmerican automakers have long offered diesel engines in their heavy duty pickup trucks, and diesel is the backbone of the trucking industry. Despite their wide application as workhorses, though, a diesel-powered vehicle can also be fun. Part of what makes diesel so attractive for commercial uses is high low-end torque. A gasoline engine typically reaches peak torque above 4,000 rpm, but a diesel engine car tends to reach peak torque below 3,000 rpm. This makes diesel engines ideal for towing, but it also gives them some extra kick off the starting blocks, which adds to the fun of driving.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h4>4. Great Durability</h4>\nDiesel engines are composed of sturdier parts than gasoline engines, and they operate at lower speeds (thanks again to the low-end torque), so they can last longer without needing major repairs. Jean and Tim Jennings are hoping for half a million miles from their diesel-powered <a href=http://www.jeanknowscars.com/videos/car-reviews/2013-volkswagen-jetta-sportwagen-tdi target=\"_blank\">Jetta SportWagen</a>. It’s an unusual owner who would expect to get that many miles out of a gasoline powerplant.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<h4>5. Lower Cost of Ownership</h4>\r\nFor many buyers, the deciding factor between buying a diesel and sticking with a gasoline engine will be cost. Diesel cars can initially cost more than their gasoline counterparts–and diesel fuel is typically more expensive. But, over time, and depending on the car, diesel-powered cars may have a lower cost of ownership. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"Yes, the price displayed at the gas station is higher for diesel. But diesel’s significantly better fuel economy means that many owners actually save money on fuel compared with a car with a gasoline engine. This, combined with the higher resale value that diesel cars enjoy, means that many owners end up saving money over the life of the car.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"The Road Trips","id":1034777,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/life-with-jean/the-road-trips","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Reviews","id":1023765,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos/car-reviews","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"All Videos","id":1023756,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/videos","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Life with Jean","id":1034767,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/life-with-jean","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-22T09:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Daytona","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48514605/Daytona-300.jpg","fileMasterId":48514605,"fileName":"Daytona-300.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":169},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":300}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-20T13:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Daytona","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43227301/Daytona-24.jpg","fileMasterId":43227301,"fileName":"Daytona-24.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":355},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":622}},"homepage":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2013-02-22T09:52:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"","title":"Daytona","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/43284748/Daytona-980.jpg","fileMasterId":43284748,"fileName":"Daytona-980.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"homepage","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":320},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":980}}},"pages":[{"id":455460,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"adSetCode":"","alignment":"block","autoPlay":0,"disableAdPreRoll":false,"embedCode":"<object classid='clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000' id='ooyalaPlayer' width='1280' height='720'codebase='http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/swflash.cab'><param name='movie' value='http://www.ooyala.com/player.swf' /><param name='bgcolor' value='#000000' /><param name='wmode' value='Transparent'/><param name='allowScriptAccess' value='always' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><param name='flashvars' value='embedCode=hvaDhpOTrsFBZbwoKKh-QzYRntNz36qL&autoplay=0&loop=0&browserPlacement=4&width=1280&height=720&wmode=Transparent' /><embed src='http://www.ooyala.com/player.swf' bgcolor='#000000' width='1280' height='720' name='ooyalaPlayer' wmode='Transparent' align='middle' play='0' loop='0' allowscriptaccess='always' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowfullscreen='true' flashvars='embedCode=hvaDhpOTrsFBZbwoKKh-QzYRntNz36qL&autoplay=0&loop=0&browserPlacement=4&width=1280&height=720&wmode=Transparent' pluginspage='http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer'> </embed></object>","height":720,"loop":0,"maintainAspectRatio":true,"ooyalaId":"1_qp1786mc","thumbnailUrl":"https://cfvod.kaltura.com/p/1807801/sp/180780100/thumbnail/entry_id/1_qp1786mc/version/100000/acv/151","transparency":"transparent","videoLength":211000,"width":1280,"type":"video"},{"order":1,"text":"<h3>The Rolex 24 at Daytona, January 2012\n</h3>\nLast year, 2012, marked the fiftieth anniversary of the most important twenty-four-hour race in the United States, the Rolex 24 at Daytona.

Mazda’s racing boss John Doonan brought three Mazda 6 race cars to Daytona to shake out race-prepared Skyactiv diesel engines, the first diesel engine to race at Daytona.

At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno.
