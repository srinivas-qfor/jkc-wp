I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-03-23T14:21:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"infiniti-qx60-homepage","title":"Infiniti Qx60 Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/100590602/infiniti-qx60-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":100590602,"fileName":"infiniti-qx60-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-03-23T14:21:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"infiniti-qx60-homepage","title":"Infiniti Qx60 Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/100590602/infiniti-qx60-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":100590602,"fileName":"infiniti-qx60-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-03-23T14:21:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"infiniti-qx60-header","title":"Infiniti Qx60 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/100590584/infiniti-qx60-header.jpg","fileMasterId":100590584,"fileName":"infiniti-qx60-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":928916,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Seven-passenger, front-wheel-drive luxury crossover<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $43,395 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $54,690 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.5-liter V-6, 265 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Continuously variable automatic with manual shift mode<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 21 mpg city/27 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature: </strong>Power rear liftgate<br> \n<strong>Options I can’t live without:</strong> Backup collision intervention, blind spot and lane departure warning, intelligent cruise control (part of Technology package, $2,800)<br> \n<strong>Notable standard features on this model: </strong>Rearview camera, heated front seats<br> \n<strong>Notable options on this model: </strong>Navigation, eight-inch touchscreen, Around View monitor with moving object detection and front and rear sonar (part of Premium Plus package, $3,000)<br> \n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> 2015 Acura MDX ($43,685), 2015 Audi Q7 ($48,300), 2015 Buick Enclave ($39,050), 2015 Lincoln MKT ($43,210) (prices include destination charges)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Infiniti Qx60 05","caption":"","fileMasterId":100590542,"fileName":"infiniti-qx60-05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/100590542/infiniti-qx60-05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>The Infiniti QX60 3.5 looks like a big SUV (it’s actually mid-size),</strong> but it is surprisingly easy to drive and to live with, for a three-row crossover.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"It helps that the QX60 has just a ton more style than cars of this ilk.

It has a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), which Infiniti is very big on, and there are Standard, Sport, Snow, and Eco drive modes. The main CVT benefit is that there are no gears to mesh and gnash and make loud noises while straining to up- and downshift. CVTs do a better job of maintaining optimum engine revs. And that pretty much works. The QX60’s CVT tends to hem and haw a little at higher speeds, but probably not enough to bother most drivers.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Maintain Proper Tire Pressure</h3>\nOur expert friends at the<a href=\"http://www.tirerack.com/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Tire Rack,</a> the one-stop tire shopping website, tell us that proper tire pressure is the one thing that can help the most if you hit a pothole. If a tire is running low on air and you hit a pothole, you’re more likely to sustain damage because the rubber can get pinched between the pothole and the edge of the wheel. If it’s overinflated, it will be more unyielding and thus, more susceptible to surface damage. So, get a tire gauge and use it—or stop off at your local service station and check the air pressure frequently.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>2. Don’t Hit a Pothole in the First Place</h3>\nWatch the road even more carefully than usual this time of year. Slow down enough that you have time to avoid a pothole once you’ve spotted it.

Check for Tire Damage</h3>\r\nGet in the habit of checking your tires, says Tire Rack’s Matt Edmonds. That’s especially true after you have hit a pothole.

If there are bulges or bumps—something that looks like a blister, Edmonds says—it probably means you’ve cut the tire’s interliner, which means air can get between it and the rest of the tire. To know for sure, you have to have someone demount the tire from the wheel.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-06T08:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"kia-soul-ev-promolarge","title":"Kia Soul Ev Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103427690/kia-soul-ev-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":103427690,"fileName":"kia-soul-ev-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-06T08:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"kia-soul-ev-promolarge","title":"Kia Soul Ev Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103427690/kia-soul-ev-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":103427690,"fileName":"kia-soul-ev-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-06T08:44:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"kia-soul-ev-header","title":"Kia Soul Ev Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103427738/kia-soul-ev-header.jpg","fileMasterId":103427738,"fileName":"kia-soul-ev-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":934615,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>Vital Stats</h3>\n<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, front-wheel-drive hatchback<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $34,525<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A2-uS_QycCI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>Price as tested:</strong> $36,650 (Soul EV+) (prices include destination charge, but not $7,500 federal tax credit or possible state tax credits)<br> \n<strong>Engine:</strong> Electric motor and 27-kWh lithium-ion-polymer battery, 109 horsepower, 210 pound-feet of torque<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> One-speed direct drive<br>\n<strong>Safety ratings:</strong> Not rated by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or Insurance Institute for \nHighway Safety.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-06T13:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford-f150-promolarge","title":"Ford F150 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103462085/ford-f150-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":103462085,"fileName":"ford-f150-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-06T13:08:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford-f150-promolarge","title":"Ford F150 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103462085/ford-f150-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":103462085,"fileName":"ford-f150-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-06T13:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"ford-f150-header","title":"Ford F150 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103461764/ford-f150-header.jpg","fileMasterId":103461764,"fileName":"ford-f150-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":934689,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"F150 Supercab","caption":"","fileMasterId":91056634,"fileName":"f150-supercab.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91056634/f150-supercab.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>Before testing the 2015 Ford F-150 4x2 SuperCab, I’d seldom considered</strong> the difference between extended cab and crew cab pickups, but it’s an important consideration for anyone buying a new truck.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"F150 Supercrew","caption":"","fileMasterId":103582013,"fileName":"f150-supercrew.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103582013/f150-supercrew.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Besides these two versions, Ford also offers a regular cab with a single seat for three people,</strong> but the typical buyer is the termite doctor or local utility companies.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Ahrens","firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Ahrens","jobTitle":"Contributing Writer","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"When <em>Automobile</em> launched in 1986, my byline appeared on a sidebar to the cover story written by our founding editor David E. Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-10T06:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"macan-promolarge","title":"Macan Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/104948381/macan-promolarge.png","fileMasterId":104948381,"fileName":"macan-promolarge.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-10T06:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"macan-promolarge","title":"Macan Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/104948381/macan-promolarge.png","fileMasterId":104948381,"fileName":"macan-promolarge.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-10T06:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"macan-header","title":"Macan Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/104948510/macan-header.png","fileMasterId":104948510,"fileName":"macan-header.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":935056,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<h3>2015 Porsche Macan Turbo</h3>\n<strong>Type:</strong> All-wheel-drive compact luxury crossover<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $50,895 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $97,065 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong> Engine:</strong> Twin-turbocharged 3.6-liter V-6, 400 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Seven-speed double-clutch automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 17 mpg city/23 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Heated sport steering wheel<br>\n<strong>Options I can't live without:</strong> Sport chrono package ($1,290)<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Eighteen-way adaptive sport seats, Bose surround sound system, navigation system, xenon headlights, LED daytime running lights<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Test car is fully loaded with 25 options.

These cameras do more than give you a look; they interface with technology such as lane departure warning and blind spot monitoring systems that can give you a visual or sound warning and even override your driving with a correction. The 360-degree view is so useful that it’s likely to trickle down to become at least optional equipment on a wide variety of vehicles. For now, you can find it on cars like the <strong>2015 Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class</strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/2015-kia-k900-luxury/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Kia K900</a></strong>.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-13T11:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-promolarge","title":"Vw Golf Sportwagen 2015 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106141046/vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":106141046,"fileName":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-13T11:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-promolarge","title":"Vw Golf Sportwagen 2015 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106141046/vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":106141046,"fileName":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-13T11:36:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-header","title":"Vw Golf Sportwagen 2015 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106141103/vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-header.jpg","fileMasterId":106141103,"fileName":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":935335,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Vw Golf Sportwagen 2015 02","caption":"","fileMasterId":106141019,"fileName":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106141019/vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, front-wheel-drive wagon<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $27,815 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $29,505 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Turbocharged 1.8-liter four-cylinder, 170 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Five-speed manual (standard); six-speed automatic (optional) <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 25 mpg city/35 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Heated front seats<br>\n<strong>Option I can't live without:</strong> Titan black leatherette interior (no-cost option) <br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Rearview camera, keyless access with push-button start, panoramic power tilting and sliding sunroof, cooled glove box, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Driver Assistance package (includes forward collision warning, park assist, $895)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> 2015 Honda Crosstour ($28,410); 2015 Subaru Outback ($25,745); 2015 Toyota Prius V ($27,575) (all prices include destination charges)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Jennings Jetta","caption":"","fileMasterId":106160009,"fileName":"jennings-jetta.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106160009/jennings-jetta.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Let’s start with a little full-disclosure moment.

It also came with seventeen-inch alloy wheels, and our test car had a Driver Assistance package ($895) that includes forward collision warning and park assist technology.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Vw Golf Sportwagen 2015 13","caption":"","fileMasterId":106141100,"fileName":"vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-13.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106141100/vw-golf-sportwagen-2015-13.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":11,"text":"<strong>The new Golf lineup has also been modernized inside.</strong> The look and feel are really quite striking, making the SportWagen feel like a much more expensive vehicle.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"My husband is a no-frills kind of hunter-gatherer.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Audi has added some playful retro touches to the clean, well-thought-out interior that is the hallmark of this automaker. The infotainment system (MMI) includes navigation; the A3 also comes with a long list of standard features including a panoramic sunroof, dual-zone climate control, and leather-trimmed seats. Lovers of advanced driving technology will appreciate Audi Drive Select that allows you to adjust the performance characteristics of the car, the Pre Sense Basic system that preps the vehicle’s restraint systems when an emergency maneuver is detected, and a 4G LTE data connection. Those who long for the sporty silhouette of the old A3 hatchback will have to wait for the upcoming 2016 A3 Sportback TDI or the Sportback e-tron hybrid model that promises 204 horsepower. For now, you can choose among seven variants, four body styles, and five unique engines in the A3/S3 family.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe A3 is an all-new model for 2015.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Audi A3 interior","fileMasterId":103984808,"fileName":"audi-a3-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103984808/audi-a3-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Audi A3","fileMasterId":103984643,"fileName":"audi-a3-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103984643/audi-a3-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Audi A3","fileMasterId":103984640,"fileName":"audi-a3-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103984640/audi-a3-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"A3 Header","caption":"","fileMasterId":123776144,"fileName":"a3-header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/123776144/a3-header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Audi A3/S3</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/cool-tech/car-tech-news/2015-audi-a3-car-as-computer/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Audi A3: Car as Computer</a> March 13, 2014<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/at-home/2015-audi-a3-2-0t-quattro-s-tronic/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Review: 2015 Audi A3 2.0T Quattro S Tronic</a> by Jean Jennings (with video) May 27, 2014<br>","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":38737,"make":"Audi","model":"A3","year":2015},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":7},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:16:36.958-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866196959 }} },{ "_id":673339,"title":"2015 Audi A4","subTitle":"","slug":"2015-audi-a4","promoTitle":"2015 Audi A4","promoTeaserSmall":"Designed to drive.","promoTeaser":"Designed to drive.","keywords":["2015 Audi A4"],"metaTitle":"2015 Audi A4","metaKeywords":["2015 Audi A4; 2015 Audi S4; Audi; sedan; German"],"metaDescription":"Designed to drive.

From the base 333-horsepower supercharged V-6 to the 500 horsepower W-12, the A8 is really about superior engineering and impressive speed as much as that classy interior.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe A8 and S8 get redesigned front and rear fascias.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Audi A8 interior","fileMasterId":103978475,"fileName":"audi-a8-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103978475/audi-a8-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Audi A8","fileMasterId":103978511,"fileName":"audi-a8-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103978511/audi-a8-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Audi A8","fileMasterId":103978349,"fileName":"audi-a8-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103978349/audi-a8-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:16:40.666-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866200667 }} },{ "_id":679981,"title":"2016 GMC Terrain Denali: Designer Walkaround","subTitle":"Helen Emsley has made GMC a brand worth watching.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

The C-Max feels confident on the road with steering, power, and braking that respond well to inputs. Both models have a regenerative braking system that harnesses 95 percent of braking energy to charge the lithium-ion batteries.

The new sporty Escape distinguished itself quickly in the very crowded small sport-ute segment with a unique look and a variety of upscale features. When you slide into the driver’s seat, the small-truck heritage of the Escape is nowhere to be found. The cabin is attractive and comfortable, and the controls are easy to reach and decipher. The Escape can be had in three trims: S, SE, and Titanium. The base S trim can only be equipped with the 168-horsepower 2.5-liter four-cylinder and front-wheel drive. The SE can be had with any of the three available engines, with front- or four-wheel drive, and with an options package that includes features such as a dual-zone automatic climate control and a backup warning system. <br><br>At the top of the Escape heap is the Titanium trim. It’s loaded up with premium touches, comes in front- or all-wheel-drive, and offers a choice between two turbocharged EcoBoost engines. That power will come in handy if you opt for the tow package that enables the Escape to pull up to 3,500 pounds. The hatch can swallow a respectable 34 cubic feet of stuff; that number doubles with the rear seats folded. Optionally, the adjustable, hands-free liftgate—it opens with a kick of your foot under the rear bumper—makes loading cargo a cinch. Like many Ford models, the Escape can be optioned with park assist, a system that takes control of the steering to help you parallel park, drama free.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nMagnetic Metallic grey exterior paint","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Escape interior","fileMasterId":106515263,"fileName":"ford-escape-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106515263/ford-escape-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Escape","fileMasterId":106515257,"fileName":"ford-escape-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106515257/ford-escape-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Escape","fileMasterId":106515251,"fileName":"ford-escape-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106515251/ford-escape-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":6},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:16:48.427-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866208427 }} },{ "_id":679256,"title":"2015 Ford Expedition","subTitle":"Supersize utility for the whole family.","slug":"2015-ford-expedition","promoTitle":"2015 Ford Expedition","promoTeaserSmall":"Supersize utility for the whole family.","promoTeaser":"Supersize utility for the whole family.","keywords":["2015 Ford Expedition"],"metaTitle":"2015 Ford Expedition","metaKeywords":["2015 Ford Expedition; Ford; SUV; sport-utility; American"],"metaDescription":"2015 Ford Expedition: Supersize utility for the whole family.

Both standard and extended-length Expedition EL models can accommodate eight, and the EL boasts 42.6 cubic feet of cargo space even with the seats fully occupied. The third row folds flat; a power-operated third row is optional on the XLT, standard on the remaining trims. The second row slides forward for easier access. Four trims are available, and each available with rear- or four-wheel drive. The entry-level XLT is equipped with standards like a leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel, a 4.2-inch display with USB connectivity, and a radar-based backup warning system. Limited buyers will enjoy the perforated leather seats and a power liftgate. The King Ranch version of the Expedition has a Southwest color palate for the perforated leather-trimmed seats—the front are heated and ventilated, while those in the second row are heated—and gets such niceties as remote start, power-deployable running boards, and an eight-inch touchscreen infotainment display. When optioned with the heavy-duty trailer package, the Expedition can tow up to 9,200 pounds, depending on the drivetrain. Select from three driving modes (Comfort, Normal, and Sport) that alter the suspension for a customized ride, and enjoy all that the new Expedition has to offer.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nThe 3.5-liter turbocharged V-6, a refreshed front end, more available features, and the Platinum trim level.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Expedition interior","fileMasterId":106516985,"fileName":"ford-expedition-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106516985/ford-expedition-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Expedition","fileMasterId":106516982,"fileName":"ford-expedition-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106516982/ford-expedition-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Expedition","fileMasterId":106516979,"fileName":"ford-expedition-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106516979/ford-expedition-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"SUVs","classGroup":"SUV","color":"","id":41278,"make":"Ford","model":"Expedition","year":2015},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":7},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:16:48.678-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866208679 }} },{ "_id":679257,"title":"2015 Ford Explorer","subTitle":"Tried-and-true SUV classic.","slug":"2015-ford-explorer","promoTitle":"2015 Ford Explorer","promoTeaserSmall":"Tried-and-true SUV classic.","promoTeaser":"Tried-and-true SUV classic.","keywords":["2015 Ford Explorer"],"metaTitle":"2015 Ford Explorer","metaKeywords":["2015 Ford Explorer; Ford; SUV; sport-utility; crossover; American"],"metaDescription":"Tried-and-true SUV classic.

With three cab choices, three bed lengths, four available engines, as well as five trim levels with increasing interior elegance and tech features, the line’s configurability is seemingly limitless and can take the F-150 from bare-bones work truck to powerful luxury hauler. Utility essentials like tow/haul mode, a cargo lamp, and roll stability and trailer sway control are standard on all F-150 models. The optional BoxLink system adds metal brackets and cleats allowing a variety of accessories—ramps, storage bins, bed dividers—to be secured in the cargo bed. Although the F-150’s styling is not as revolutionary as the much-touted aluminum construction, its stout front end, wide stance, and orderly interior suit its purpose nicely.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nAluminum alloy materials lighten the F-150 considerably.\n\n<h3>More from Us on the Ford F-150</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/2015-ford-f-150/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Ford F-150: Should You Buy It?</a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/ford-f-150-supercab-or-supercrew/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Real World Test: Ford F-150 SuperCab or SuperCrew?</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford F-150 interior","fileMasterId":106519130,"fileName":"ford-f150-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106519130/ford-f150-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford F-150","fileMasterId":106519067,"fileName":"ford-f150-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106519067/ford-f150-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford F-150","fileMasterId":106519127,"fileName":"ford-f150-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106519127/ford-f150-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Ford F-150</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/2015-ford-f-150/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Ford F-150, You Auto Know</a> March 9, 2015 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/on-the-road/ford-f-150-to-brooklyn/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Ford F-150 to Brooklyn</a> January 2, 2014 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/ford-f-150-supercab-or-supercrew/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Ford F-150: SuperCab or SuperCrew?</a> April 7, 2015","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":32720,"make":"Ford","model":"F-150","year":2015},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"8bfe9141-264d-3530-adde-b612c376b580","type":"mediaTag","name":"Trucks","path":"/Main/Trucks"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":10},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:16:49.932-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866209933 }} },{ "_id":673982,"title":"2016 Kia Optima","subTitle":"The tiger-nose grille continues on a new version of the stylish sedan.","slug":"2016-kia-optima","promoTitle":"2016 Kia Optima","promoTeaserSmall":"The tiger-nose grille continues on a new version of the stylish sedan.","promoTeaser":"The tiger-nose grille continues on a new version of the stylish sedan.","keywords":["2016 Kia Optima"],"metaTitle":"2016 Kia Optima -

Models range from the F-250 up to the monster-sized F-450, and it shares its five trim levels with the F-150. The Lariat and King Ranch sit in the middle and give a nod to Southwest styling, particularly the King Ranch with its Mesa brown interior trim. The Platinum level offers every conceivable convenience like a high-definition touchscreen display for use with the Sync system that includes navigation and infotainment. Style and safety upgrades include walnut wood dash accents and a heated steering wheel, as well as brake enhancements for trailer control and power-adjustable pedals. There are two available V-8 engines: a 6.2-liter gasoline unit with flex-fuel capability and a turbo-diesel with a hefty 860 pound-feet of torque. For 2015, the turbo-diesel receives a bump in horsepower, now up to 440 hp. All that oomph will surely be called upon when towing up to the maximum of 31,200 pounds. Rear- or four-wheel-drive models are available in three generous cabin sizes. Store your files in a handy armrest compartment or lift the back seat in the CrewCab or SuperCab to hide away larger valuable items. No matter what your industry, the Super Duty series has what it takes to become your all-terrain field office.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nTurbo-diesel V-8 engine gets 40 more horsepower","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford F-series Super Duty","fileMasterId":106519994,"fileName":"ford-fseriessuperduty-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106519994/ford-fseriessuperduty-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford F-series Super Duty","fileMasterId":106519991,"fileName":"ford-fseriessuperduty-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106519991/ford-fseriessuperduty-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford F-series Super Duty","fileMasterId":106519988,"fileName":"ford-fseriessuperduty-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106519988/ford-fseriessuperduty-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":38426,"make":"Ford","model":"F-350","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":38425,"make":"Ford","model":"F-250","year":2015},{"id":"8bfe9141-264d-3530-adde-b612c376b580","type":"mediaTag","name":"Trucks","path":"/Main/Trucks"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:16:52.877-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866212878 }} },{ "_id":679265,"title":"2015 Ford Fiesta","subTitle":"Feisty and fun.","slug":"2015-ford-fiesta","promoTitle":"2015 Ford Fiesta","promoTeaserSmall":"Feisty and fun.","promoTeaser":"Feisty and fun.","keywords":["2015 Ford Fiesta"],"metaTitle":"2015 Ford Fiesta","metaKeywords":["2015 Ford Fiesta; Ford; sedan; hatchback; American"],"metaDescription":"2015 Ford Fiesta: Feisty and fun.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

The subcompact, in either hatchback or sedan form, sips fuel. Both versions are front-wheel drive with a choice between two small but willing engines: a 1.0-liter turbocharged three-cylinder and a 1.6-liter four-cylinder. Despite its humble starting price, the Fiesta comes standard with Ford’s voice-controlled Sync and can be optioned with the MyFord Touch infotainment system that includes navigation and AppLink. Another option is Ford MyKey, which shuts off audio until the seatbelts are fastened. Safety systems cannot be disabled, and parents are able to set volume and speed limits. <br><br>Two transmission choices, a five-speed manual or a six-speed automatic, are available on all three trims: S, SE and Titanium. The ST model enters hot-hatch territory with a six-speed manual transmission, sport suspension, and optional body-hugging Recaro racing seats in Molten Orange. The cabin is cozy, and very tall drivers may feel the roof is a bit too close for comfort, but the Fiesta’s interior is comfortable, attractive, and logically laid out. The joyful little Fiesta has a lot to offer for those looking for a fun ride in the compact segment.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nMagnetic Metallic grey adds some mystery to the Fiesta color choices.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Fiesta interior","fileMasterId":106521797,"fileName":"ford-fiesta-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106521797/ford-fiesta-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Fiesta","fileMasterId":106521872,"fileName":"ford-fiesta-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106521872/ford-fiesta-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Fiesta","fileMasterId":106521866,"fileName":"ford-fiesta-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106521866/ford-fiesta-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Fiesta","fileMasterId":106521863,"fileName":"ford-fiesta-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106521863/ford-fiesta-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Ford Fiesta</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/car-on-the-road/ford-fiesta-st-mr-song/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Ford Fiesta ST, Meet Mr. Song</a> October 29, 2013","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43523,"make":"Ford","model":"Fiesta","year":2015},{"id":"71d39f07-0bc5-39bd-9468-12085dc13b7c","type":"mediaTag","name":"First_Car","path":"/Main/First_Car"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":8},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:16:53.391-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866213392 }} },{ "_id":679267,"title":"2015 Ford Flex","subTitle":"Utility in an old-school wrapper.","slug":"2015-ford-flex","promoTitle":"2015 Ford Flex","promoTeaserSmall":"Utility in an old-school wrapper.","promoTeaser":"Utility in an old-school wrapper.","keywords":["2015 Ford Flex"],"metaTitle":"2015 Ford Flex - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["2015 Ford Flex; Ford; sport-utility; SUV; crossover; American"],"metaDescription":"2015 Ford Flex: Utility in an old-school wrapper.

A plethora of video, navigation, and connectivity options are available if you add the Sync infotainment with MyFord Touch system that can be accessed by voice, steering wheel controls, or a tap on the eight-inch touchscreen. A backup sensor system that alerts you to obstructions behind the car is standard, but other safety options like inflatable seatbelts or blind spot warning are on higher trim levels only.

The exterior received a refresh that gives it the critically acclaimed Fusion-style narrow grille and thinner head- and taillamps. LEDs are optional for both. The cabin gets new seat trim options, switches, and a revised center console and glove box. A heated steering wheel is newly available as well as a full suite of safety and connectivity technology including a rearview camera (standard for 2015), blind spot and lane keeping systems, and the Sync infotainment system with AppLink. The Focus also received a new stability control system and revised suspensions, front and rear, and the small but spunky 1.0-liter three-cylinder from the Fiesta is now available. <br><br>The ST model is the performance-oriented Focus. It comes only with a six-speed manual transmission to go with a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine, and it's fitted inside and out with sporty color schemes. Besides the Focus ST, there are four additional sedan or hatch models to suit every taste: the essentials only S, the mid-level SE, the loaded Titanium, and the plug-in Focus Electric hatch. The latter can reach 84 miles per hour and has an estimated range of 76 miles. Inside, an earth-friendly bio-foam fills the cushions, and the seat fabric is made entirely from recycled materials. But those who put a priority on green technology, can feel good about choosing any of the Focus models since even the gas versions of Focus are built in part with solar power at Ford’s Wayne, Michigan, plant. In either body style or any trim, the Focus offers a roomy interior in a small, parking friendly and fuel-efficient package.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nA freshened exterior and interior, revised front and rear suspensions, 1.0-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine, and the rearview camera is now standard.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Focus interior","fileMasterId":106524755,"fileName":"ford-focus-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106524755/ford-focus-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Ford Focus","fileMasterId":106524752,"fileName":"ford-focus-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/106524752/ford-focus-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Ford Focus</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround/2016-ford-focus-rs-jeans-driveway/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2016 Ford Focus RS: Jean's Driveway</a> March 10, 2015 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/car-on-the-road/2015-ford-focus-st/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Ford Focus ST</a> March 23, 2015 <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/events/chevrolet-cruze-and-ford-focus/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Chevrolet Cruze and Ford Focus</a> April 15, 2014","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":41536,"make":"Ford","model":"Focus","year":2015},{"id":"71d39f07-0bc5-39bd-9468-12085dc13b7c","type":"mediaTag","name":"First_Car","path":"/Main/First_Car"},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":7},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:16:53.926-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866213927 }} },{ "_id":679269,"title":"2015 Ford Fusion","subTitle":"Looks help this mid-size sedan stand out in a crowded segment.","slug":"2015-ford-fusion","promoTitle":"2015 Ford Fusion","promoTeaserSmall":"Looks help this mid-size sedan stand out in a crowded segment.","promoTeaser":"Looks help this mid-size sedan stand out in a crowded segment.","keywords":["2015 Ford Fusion"],"metaTitle":"2015 Ford Fusion - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["2015 Ford Fusion;

The 3.6-liter V-6 makes 13 more horsepower that it originally did and slightly better fuel economy in front-wheel-drive configuration. And there has been a progression of additional features, including this year’s heated wood steering wheel. But otherwise, it’s the same convenient, well-crafted big crossover as always: quiet and capable. To most eyes, it’s also beautiful. An all-new Enclave is expected for 2017, and it will have the advanced collision avoidance and other driver-assistance features lacking on the current model.

In fact, it has opened the door in a new market segment for compact crossovers. You sit up high, surveying the road as any visionary would, and although the turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine is small, it has enough push to keep you on the edge of the traffic wave. Body motions are well controlled, so there’s no bobbing when weaving. The Encore excels at commuting, and for Snow Belt duty, the available all-wheel drive is an excellent choice. Meanwhile, you can choose to get heated seats in the Encore's quiet cabin where Buick’s recent expositions of good taste come to the fore, especially in the mix of dark and light tones that can be chosen instead of the all-ebony interior. And like all others from the brand, the Encore is now equipped with 4G LTE with a Wi-Fi hot spot.

That means 36 highway mpg—really good for a car its size. The optional engine is the nice 3.6-liter V-6, and it can be paired with all-wheel drive for a sure-footedness that the good country doctor didn’t enjoy more than 100 years ago when making house calls in his Buick Model 10.

One is eAssist, which uses an electric motor and current from a small lithium-ion battery to boost the 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine—a so-called mild hybrid system, yielding 36 mpg on the highway. On the other hand, you can go for the strong push in the back that everybody likes when dashing onto the freeway or around a slower vehicle. So the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder generates 259 horsepower and a formidable 295 pound-feet of torque. To get that one, order the Regal GS with all-wheel drive. A record winter really wouldn’t pose such a big obstacle. And even though this hardware creates the slowest Regal, the AWD version still covers 0 to 60 mph in 6.8 seconds. Not bad! <br>Beyond the advanced drivetrain, the Regal offers a comfortable and rather plush cabin with dual-zone climate system, eight-inch touchscreen, and heated front seats, all standard. The standard and available safety systems make for a secure environment, although the smaller Verano actually has more air bags, if you like that sort of thing. And then there’s the infotainment system that supports up to ten devices and reads incoming text messages over the audio speakers. When we hear the name Regal, we still think of velour upholstery and Donna Summer playing on the radio. You can still get the latter—maybe streaming wirelessly through an app is the most immediate way—but otherwise the 2015 Regal reflects just how much tastes have changed since those velour days.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nOnStar with 4G LTE and standard WiFi hots pot, three new exterior colors.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Buick Regal interior","fileMasterId":103970723,"fileName":"buick-regal-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103970723/buick-regal-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Buick Regal","fileMasterId":103970696,"fileName":"buick-regal-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103970696/buick-regal-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Buick Regal","fileMasterId":103970720,"fileName":"buick-regal-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103970720/buick-regal-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Buick Regal</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/car-life/on-the-road/2014-buick-regal-over-ice/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2014 Buick Regal over Ice</a> March 5, 2014","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45441,"make":"Buick","model":"Regal","year":2015},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:16:55.754-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866215754 }} },{ "_id":673490,"title":"2015 Buick Verano","subTitle":"Deserves a shout out.","slug":"2015-buick-verano","promoTitle":"2015 Buick Verano","promoTeaserSmall":"Deserves a shout out.","promoTeaser":"Deserves a shout out.","keywords":["2015 Buick Verano"],"metaTitle":"2015 Buick Verano","metaKeywords":["2015 Buick Verano; Buick; sedan; American"],"metaDescription":"Deserves a shout out.

Otherwise, the big story on the Verano is about its connectivity with the standard IntelliLink system and OnStar with 4G LTE. It’s hard to overtax this brain: imagine a five-passenger car being able to support ten connected devices. Text messaging will read incoming texts through the speakers. And no need to hold up your iPhone, because connectivity is voice controlled through Siri Eyes Free. On top of all this is OnStar, which is faster and more comprehensive than ever. With such a level of performance, specification, features, and attractive if conventional design, it’s hard to understand why the Verano keeps so quiet among compact sedans.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nOnStar with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi hot spot, new dark sapphire blue metallic color, available appearance package for non-turbo Verano with bright chrome grille","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Buick Verano","fileMasterId":103971767,"fileName":"buick-verano-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103971767/buick-verano-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Buick Verano","fileMasterId":103971824,"fileName":"buick-verano-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103971824/buick-verano-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Buick Verano</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/at-home/jeans-driveway-2013-buick-verano/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2013 Buick Verano</a> with video November 5, 2012","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45442,"make":"Buick","model":"Verano","year":2015},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:16:56.262-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866216263 }} },{ "_id":680163,"title":"2015 Cadillac ATS","subTitle":"A well-equipped and refined performance compact.","slug":"2015-cadillac-ats","promoTitle":"2015 Cadillac ATS","promoTeaserSmall":"A well-equipped and refined performance compact.","promoTeaser":"A well-equipped and refined performance compact.","keywords":["2015 Cadillac ATS"],"metaTitle":"2015 Cadillac ATS","metaKeywords":["2015 Cadillac ATS; Cadillac; sedan; coupe; American"],"metaDescription":"A well-equipped and refined performance compact.

Based on the award-winning Chevrolet Volt's platform, the ELR is a technological feat packaged in gorgeous exterior design, offering environment-conscious buyers a way to drive electric without the range anxiety. A fully charged ELR can travel up to 37 miles using only the electricity stored in its 16.5-kwH electric battery, but after its range-extending engine kicks in, the ELR achieves approximately 33 mpg and can travel 340 miles on a tank of gas. Setting it apart from the Volt is a sport-tuned chassis, the same one used by the CTS. The vehicle’s driving modes help make the vehicle handle a bit more like its Cadillac siblings. But you don’t buy the ELR because you like to accelerate off the line—you buy the ELR because you like alternative propulsion technology.

For the most part, they are correct, but why should the chauffeur be the only one to play with the 811 pound-feet of torque? The Mulsanne is the largest and most expensive of the Bentley lineup, and, yes, it is most often seen with a liveried driver wearing a chauffeur’s cap behind the wheel. Case in point: there is an optional champagne chiller tucked away within the rear center armrest that holds two champagne bottles and three bespoke crystal flutes. But it’s still a driver’s car, and its 6.75-liter engine can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds to outrun the paparazzi and boasts the most torque of any production gasoline-powered vehicle on the market. The Mulsanne caters to a limited audience, and it’s not just because of the $300,000 price.

Available in either a four- or five-seat configuration, the Flying Spur is more than adequately powered by either a 626-horsepower 6.0-liter twin-turbo W-12 engine or a slightly more modest 500-hp 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8. The recently added V-8 isn’t necessarily for the environmentally conscious—because no one buys a V-8 to save on trips to the gas pump. Rather, it’s tuned to be sportier thanks in part to the weight savings that come from using a lighter engine, and it presents different driving dynamics. But still, the W-12 emits that low, unmistakable engine sound that only $200,000 can buy. The interior of the Flying Spur is heady, with luxurious materials at every turn and touch, including polished or matte metals on the door, supple leather seats, and wool floor mats. And although the sedan features some of the latest safety and connectivity options, such as parking sensors and Wi-Fi, no one buys a Bentley for its cutting-edge technology, unless, of course, they’re talking about the massaging front seats.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe V-8 gets more power, more customization options.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Bentley Continental interior","fileMasterId":109271006,"fileName":"bentley-flyingspur-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109271006/bentley-flyingspur-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Bentley Continental","fileMasterId":109270835,"fileName":"bentley-flyingspur-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109270835/bentley-flyingspur-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43159,"make":"Bentley","model":"Flying Spur","year":2015},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:16:59.778-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866219779 }} },{ "_id":680158,"title":"2015 Bentley Continental","subTitle":"A handcrafted performance grand tourer.","slug":"2015-bentley-continental","promoTitle":"2015 Bentley Continental","promoTeaserSmall":"A handcrafted performance grand tourer.","promoTeaser":"A handcrafted performance grand tourer.","keywords":["2015 Bentley Continental"],"metaTitle":"2015 Bentley Continental","metaKeywords":["2015 Bentley Continental; Bentley; British; coupe; convertible"],"metaDescription":"A handcrafted performance grand tourer.

The buyer is presented with a seemingly infinite ways to outfit the Continental's interior and exterior:  “hides” in fifteen different colors, seven real wood veneers, metal interior trims, and 120 exterior paint colors. And that’s just the standard set of choices. Everything you see and touch oozes money, including the Breitling-designed instrument panel and clock, the lamb's-wool floor mats, and the diamond-patterned quilted seats. But it’s not just about looking cool; the Continental is the quintessential grand tourer, meant to be driven on long stretches for long distances. There are five engine options, including a 626-horsepower W12 which, in a nod to the EPA, now shuts down six of its cylinders when they're not needed to improve fuel economy. All are paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters. There may be cars that are sportier and better suited for the track, but they’re not as handcrafted as the GT.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nRevised exterior, new 21-inch wheel option, new exterior color options, and the racing-car-based GT3-R model.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Bentley Continental","fileMasterId":109269692,"fileName":"bentley-continental-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109269692/bentley-continental-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Bentley Continental","fileMasterId":109269755,"fileName":"bentley-continental-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109269755/bentley-continental-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Bentley Continental","fileMasterId":109269689,"fileName":"bentley-continental-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/109269689/bentley-continental-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Bentley Continental</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/at-home/2013-bentley-continental-gtc-v8/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2013 Bentley Continental GTC V8</a> July 29, 2013, video","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":44570,"make":"Bentley","model":"Continental GT","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45456,"make":"Bentley","model":"Continental GTC","year":2015},{"id":"641bb9a2-17a1-3cc9-9585-5bd8468fcc24","type":"mediaTag","name":"Indulgence","path":"/Main/Indulgence"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:00.077-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866220078 }} },{ "_id":680550,"title":"2015 Jaguar XJL Portfolio AWD","subTitle":"As beautiful as an Italian speedboat to look at...and to drive.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

The MKC grille takes your eye along the leading edge of the hood, across its Angry Bird headlamps and straight into a deeply creased shoulder line that disappears and reappears as it passes the rear wheel. The doors have a deep concavity that is anchored by a lower sill between front and rear wheel wells, and tied visually to the front end’s lower grille.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034785,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-30T11:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"trip-promolarge","title":"Trip Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111408305/trip-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":111408305,"fileName":"trip-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-30T11:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"trip-promolarge","title":"Trip Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111408305/trip-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":111408305,"fileName":"trip-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-04-30T11:05:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"trip-header","title":"Trip Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/111408296/trip-header.jpg","fileMasterId":111408296,"fileName":"trip-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":947800,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"My strategy for a road trip may be totally different from yours, but it works for me.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Having done my share of big drives, I’ve found 500 to 600 miles per day is about right for a pleasant experience, especially among a group.
