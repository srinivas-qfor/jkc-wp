After all, I come from Michigan, a place where weather extremes are intense. I believe that it is possible to get to a level of comfort if you just take the time to trust your clothing choices and the heating or cooling technology around you. That extends not only to home and office but most especially to the car.

I trust the car's modern HVAC system to achieve a mid-70s level of comfort quickly, and I am almost never wrong. So I don't do what a lot of people (like my colleague Molly Jean, for example) do and roll the windows down while also blasting the air conditioning on maximum. That is a waste of resources and energy, and besides, if it's that hot inside the car, it's also hot outside, so why encourage more hot air to enter the sanctum of the passenger compartment?","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"The same holds true when it's icy cold out.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"On The Road","id":1034953,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/car-on-the-road","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-18T10:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"bmw-i3-promolarge","title":"Bmw I3 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/137631032/bmw-i3-promolarge.png","fileMasterId":137631032,"fileName":"bmw-i3-promolarge.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-18T10:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"bmw-i3-promolarge","title":"Bmw I3 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/137631032/bmw-i3-promolarge.png","fileMasterId":137631032,"fileName":"bmw-i3-promolarge.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-18T10:37:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"bmw-i3-header","title":"Bmw I3 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/137631029/bmw-i3-header.png","fileMasterId":137631029,"fileName":"bmw-i3-header.png","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":961724,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dnK7XkhutXk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Bmw I3 16","caption":"","fileMasterId":137630933,"fileName":"bmw-i3-16.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/137630933/bmw-i3-16.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Four-passenger, rear-wheel-drive compact hatchback<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> i3, i3 with Range Extender<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $43,350 for i3; $47,210 for i3 with Range Extender (prices include destination charge) <br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $52,750<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> All-electric motor, 170 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Single-stage automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 117 MPGe; 39 mpg (combined city/highway) on gasoline power <br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> Not rated<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering</strong> (all prices include destination charges): <br>\n2016 Chevrolet Spark EV ($25,995)<br>\n2016 Kia Soul EV ($32,775)<br>\n2016 Mitsubishi i-MiEV ($23,845)<br>\n2015 Nissan Leaf ($29,860)<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 7.5<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Bmw I3 11","caption":"","fileMasterId":137630921,"fileName":"bmw-i3-11.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/137630921/bmw-i3-11.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":2,"text":"<strong>People buy electric cars for many reasons: environmentalism, futuristic fannishness, a particular kind of acquisitive desire</strong> that makes people want to be the first to get the newest technology.

The i3 is a runway model of a car, with an interior that is as big a fashion statement as I’ve seen in a long time. Just a look at the materials list is exciting: a lightweight but strong carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic body—quite unusual for a non-sports car—enclosing interior panels made out of renewable Asian kenaf plants, and topped off by eucalyptus wood trim to complement the soft leather seating. And it’s not just the unusual materials, it’s the manner in which they are arrayed. The eucalyptus sheets are asymmetrically applied and bent in supple curves. The information screen appears to float in midair above the low cowl.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"It’s beautiful. It’s inspirational. It’s groundbreaking.

When you save weight, you save fuel.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"The interior materials—lovely as they are—were also chosen for sustainability and recycle status.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"Range anxiety, of course, is a big issue with an electric car. BMW addresses that with a range extender at an additional cost of $3,850. The range extender is a generator powered by a little two-cylinder gas engine that comes from a BMW motor scooter. Its job is not to drive the wheels; it’s to kick in when the electricity dips below a certain charge, and then maintain that charge. You can drive a mere seventy-two miles on a charge without it, and double that to 150 miles with it. One caveat: You really don’t want to plan a long trip; the gas engine’s 1.9-gallon capacity will have you stopping for tiny little fill-ups every, oh, seventy-five miles or so. I would say put the range extender at the top of your optional equipment list.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"Then you’ll want to accessorize with the BMW iCharging station for your garage, at another additional cost ($1,080) that doesn’t include installation. It has a twenty-five-foot cord.

It’s perhaps unfair to quibble, since you’d expect a car this small to be more of a city car, but I’m here to say that it completely handles the freeway. It is able to blow by the surrounding traffic with ease, in the all-in way that electric vehicles give you everything they have the second you hit the go pedal. The difference between lesser electrics and the i3 is that you don’t feel like it’s going to explode because you’re going too fast at 70 mph. What did happen in my test car at a steady 70 mph was a small but disconcerting side-to-side front-end drift. Most irksome.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":10,"text":"It was enough for me to set our Fun-O-Meter at 7.5. When could that ever happen in the Perfect 10 world of the BMW driving experience? Only, perhaps, in this case, because a gorgeous interior and heady acceleration do not make up for the drawbacks of permanently thrumming range anxiety and that very un-BMW-like on-center drift. In city driving, though, the fun jumps to a solid 9.5. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"The i3 I drove was well equipped, although still not fully loaded, even at $47,210. It featured the Giga World package ($1,500), which adds keyless entry, a universal garage door opener, and a set of 19-inch alloy wheels. Its stunner of a Solar Orange/Frozen Grey two-tone paint job was an additional $500. The Tech + Driving Assist package ($2,500) gives you navigation, adaptive cruise control, BMW online and BMW apps, and advanced real-time traffic information. Not present on our i3 were a Harman Kardon sound system ($800) or a set of 20-inch alloy wheels ($1,300). ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"It’s questionable, the value of spending this kind of money for an EV when gas prices seem to be on a lowering trend. As a consumer vehicle, the i3 is the most expensive car in its class by a long shot. Certainly there is the Tesla Model S, at $75,000 before incentives, but other electric-powered competitors—the Nissan Leaf, the Chevrolet Volt, the Toyota Prius Plug-in, and EV versions of the Chevrolet Spark and the Kia Soul—are much more popularly priced in the mid-$20,000s-to-low-$30,000s range.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":13,"text":"The BMW i3s you might see in the wild will be rare birds indeed.

The Macan went on sale for the 2015 model year, and so far the only problem is that Porsche can’t build enough of them. In fact, the only Porsche that outsells the Macan is the Cayenne. \n<br><br>\nThe fact that two SUVs sit atop the sales sheet doesn’t mean that Porsche has abandoned its sports car roots, though. Take the Macan on a curvy road, and it displays razor-sharp handling, with minimal body roll and exceptional turn-in. The cabin is comfortable and well put together, with quality materials and construction. All of the important controls are within easy reach, although the plethora of buttons on the center console can be confusing. \n<br><br>\nThe base model is the Macan S, which has a 340-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6 and comes standard with nineteen-inch wheels shod with all-season tires, an eleven-speaker audio system, a seven-inch TFT display, Bluetooth, three-zone automatic climate control, bi-xenon headlights, a multi-function sport steering wheel, piano black interior trim, split-folding rear seats, a power tailgate, and 17.7 cubic feet of storage capacity behind the rear seats (53.0 cubic feet with the rear seats folded).\n<br><br>\nThe Turbo model gets a more powerful engine, adaptive damping, unique wheels, full leather upholstery, and an upgraded audio system. You can get some of the Turbo’s standard features as options on the Macan S, and there is also an extensive standalone options list for both models that includes high-tech performance items like torque vectoring, active suspension management, and ceramic composite brakes.\n<br><br>\nSo far, the Macan has been a huge success for Porsche. In fact, most of the German automaker’s sales gains over the past year can be traced directly to this new model. Porsche recently stated that it would start ramping up production of the Macan. This is welcome news to prospective buyers, who have had to wait up to six months in some locations for their new vehicle. A wait, we might add, that they likely think was well worth it.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe Macan is an all-new model.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Porsche Macan interior","fileMasterId":115628645,"fileName":"porsche-macan-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115628645/porsche-macan-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Porsche Macan","fileMasterId":115628642,"fileName":"porsche-macan-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115628642/porsche-macan-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Porsche Macan","fileMasterId":115628639,"fileName":"porsche-macan-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115628639/porsche-macan-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":39201,"make":"Porsche","model":"Macan","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:30.727-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866310728 }} },{ "_id":687685,"title":"2015 Porsche Panamera","subTitle":"The Porsche of luxury sedans.","slug":"2015-porsche-panamera","promoTitle":"2015 Porsche Panamera","promoTeaserSmall":"The Porsche of luxury sedans.","promoTeaser":"The Porsche of luxury sedans.","keywords":["2015 Porsche Panamera"],"metaTitle":"2015 Porsche Panamera","metaKeywords":["2015 Porsche Panamera; Porsche; sedan; hybrid; German"],"metaDescription":"The Porsche of luxury sedans.

With the handling of a sports car and the practicality of a sedan, the Panamera has cemented its spot in the Porsche model range.\n<br><br>\nThe Panamera lineup is extensive, with no fewer than eleven trim levels. There are rear- and all-wheel-drive models, a plug-in hybrid, and normally aspirated and turbocharged engines. Oh, and there are three different long-wheelbase versions, too. Power ranges from 310 horsepower in the base version to a grin-inducing 570 horsepower in the Turbo S. A seven-speed PDK automatic is the transmission of choice in every Panamera save the S E-Hybrid, which uses the eight-speed Tiptronic S automatic.\n<br><br>\nThe cabin of the Panamera is sumptuous and bears a strong resemblance to that of the 911, at least in the front seats. One thing the Panamera doesn’t have, which can be found in other luxury sedans, is a central controller for the multimedia system. Consequently, the center console is a button-rich environment that can be confusing at first glance. The rear seats are extraordinarily comfortable and supportive, and legroom, especially in the long-wheelbase Executive models, is plentiful. The thick rear pillars hamper rearward visibility somewhat, but options like a rearview camera and blind spot monitoring mitigate that problem.\n<br><br>\nAs with every model in the Porsche lineup, there are lots of performance and appearance options. Peruse the list carefully, because it’s easy to get carried away and send the price skyrocketing.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe fastest, most powerful Panamera to date, the Turbo S, is new for 2015.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Porsche Panamera interior","fileMasterId":115627343,"fileName":"porsche-panamera-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115627343/porsche-panamera-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Porsche Panamera","fileMasterId":115627385,"fileName":"porsche-panamera-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115627385/porsche-panamera-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Porsche Panamera","fileMasterId":115627340,"fileName":"porsche-panamera-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/115627340/porsche-panamera-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43160,"make":"Porsche","model":"Panamera","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45653,"make":"Porsche","model":"Panamera Hybrid","year":2015},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:30.954-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866310955 }} },{ "_id":693493,"title":"Giving My Dogs a Day, Subaru Style","subTitle":"I imagine a dream vacation for each of my (spoiled) dogs.","slug":"giving-my-dogs-a-day-subaru-style","promoTitle":"Giving My Dogs a Day, Subaru Style","promoTeaserSmall":"I imagine a dream vacation for each of my (spoiled) dogs.","promoTeaser":"I imagine a dream vacation for each of my (spoiled) dogs.","keywords":["Giving My Dogs a Day","Subaru Style"],"metaTitle":"Giving My Dogs a Day, Subaru Style - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["dogs and cars","Subaru","Subaru Impreza","bucket list","pet ownership","car trips with dogs"],"metaDescription":"I imagine a dream vacation for each of my (spoiled) dogs.","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2015-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2015-08-24T15:49:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2015-07-23T15:49:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":false,"url":"/life-with-jean/the-dogs/giving-my-dogs-a-day-subaru-style/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Starting as a way to market higher-end used cars, the Certified Pre-Owned designation has now become commonplace at car dealerships. A Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) car is generally a car with a clean history, few past users, of relatively recent vintage, and with less than about 80,000 miles on the odometer. It undergoes an extensive pre-sale inspection, and problems are fixed by the dealer before it's offered for sale. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"What's not to like?

All CPO programs aren't alike.</h3> Manufacturers run Certified Pre-Owned programs, but so do some dealers as well as organizations such as Enterprise car rental, the National Independent Automobile Dealers Association (NIADA), and others. You need to understand where the Certified Pre-Owned designation is coming from. The big advantage of seeking out a CPO used car, rather than any old car on the lot, is that the CPO car comes with a warranty. You want it to be the manufacturer’s own warranty, not the local dealer’s. Why? If the CPO program is through the manufacturer, not just the local dealership, any warranty repairs you do need can be performed anywhere around the country. That's a strong argument in favor of the automaker's program.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Certified 01","caption":"","fileMasterId":137598113,"fileName":"certified-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/137598113/certified-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":4,"text":"<h3>2.

Earlier this summer, electric-sports-car maker Tesla started online sales of Certified Pre-Owned Model S cars that are starting to come back from lease programs.

Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"New Car Features","id":1034782,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/cool-tech/new-car-features","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Cool Tech","id":1023757,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/cool-tech","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-28T08:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cvt-promolarge","title":"Cvt Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/139567979/cvt-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":139567979,"fileName":"cvt-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-28T08:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cvt-promolarge","title":"Cvt Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/139567979/cvt-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":139567979,"fileName":"cvt-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-28T08:03:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"cvt-header","title":"Cvt Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/139567895/cvt-header.jpg","fileMasterId":139567895,"fileName":"cvt-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":962471,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Cvt Illo","caption":"","fileMasterId":139570277,"fileName":"cvt-illo.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/139570277/cvt-illo.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":0,"text":"Did you know that about thirteen percent of new cars come equipped with a continuously variable transmission? To many people—possibly including you—that technology is an enigma. If you’ve heard anything about the CVT, it's likely that your feelings about it have been affected by the harsh opinions of hard-core car enthusiasts and late adopters, who may dislike or just distrust this type of automatic transmission.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"Who likes CVTs? Auto companies, for a start. CVTs are currently available in vehicles from Audi, Honda, Hyundai, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Suzuki, and Toyota. General Motors and Chrysler are customers for the CVT made by one of Nissan’s suppliers.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"What is a transmission that has no gears doing in so many cars, and how does it affect you? ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>Here's What a CVT Is</h3>\r\nIn simplest terms, a CVT, which is coupled to the engine, is a steel or aluminum case enclosing two grooved pulley wheels. Each pulley turns on its own shaft, and a rugged belt runs between them. One pulley receives the engine’s output and distributes it to the second pulley, which sends driving force to the wheels. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"Inside the car, the driver selects Drive or Reverse, but otherwise there’s no need for shifting. In a way, having a car with a CVT isn’t so different from walking up the handicapped access ramp instead of climbing the stairs.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"A CVT is compact, lightweight, and inexpensive. Without the teeth of large gears meshing with smaller ones, as in a traditional automatic or manual transmission, the car’s occupants feel no shift shock as it moves along. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":6,"text":"<h3>And Here's How It Works</h3>\n“Instead of the engine’s internal operating speed going up and down as you progress through fixed ratios, you vary the transmission ratios,” said Alex Fedorak, spokesman for Mitsubishi, which has CVTs in several vehicles.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"Variability enters the picture when electronic calculations call for hydraulic pressure to be applied to the pulleys, making one wider and the other narrower. How wide or narrow depends on the driver’s input. At low speed, the pulley receiving the engine’s output widens and the other pulley narrows. When the car is barreling down the road, the opposite occurs. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"The belt, which is somewhat V-shaped, climbs or drops between the pulleys’ widened or narrowed sheaves. This creates an effect similar to the different ratios between fixed gears. \r\n \r\nThanks to the CVTs mediation, the engine’s internal operating speed stays more constant. As the result, though, the car tends to moo like an unmilked cow rather than roaring like a bull. Some have also noted an odd floating feeling, as if the engine and wheels aren’t precisely engaged. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":9,"text":"<h3>And Here's Why It's a Good Thing</h3>\nBut the advantage of the CVT—why manufacturers are pushing them in the marketplace—is found in superb fuel economy.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2016 Honda Fit","caption":"","fileMasterId":139567796,"fileName":"2016-Honda-Fit.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/139567796/2016-Honda-Fit.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":10,"text":"For example, the 2016 Honda Fit LX with standard 6-speed manual transmission achieves 29 city/37 highway mpg.

It allows the driver to use steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters to manually select and hold simulated, electronically controlled fixed ratios. The feature proved useful when kicking down to a passing gear on the highway. In addition, the test course included a muddy off-road section where churning along in a low gear was desirable.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":14,"text":"A stepped CVT can have other benefits as well. To keep the driver involved and take away the impression of indefiniteness, the Toyota Corolla S has a CVT that includes seven simulated ratios and a sport mode for more aggressive action among them. The Subaru WRX has a CVT with eight steps. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":15,"text":"Fedorak moved to Mitsubishi in 2014, where he renewed his familiarity with CVTs and realized how much progress has been made in delivering performance like that of a conventional automatic transmission. “If you pay close attention to your tachometer, you’ll notice the difference,” he said. “It wasn’t real evident to me right away. That’s how good the programming of them has become.” ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":16,"text":"What about the longevity questions that have sometimes surrounded CVTs?

They’re very sturdy, very massive.”","type":"paragraph"},{"order":18,"text":"<h3>So, Should You Get One on Your Next Car?</h3>\nSo if the CVT performs well enough, why even think about it? Because there may be different requirements for service, like having the transmission fluid changed rather frequently.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

The three-row configuration can accommodate five, six, or seven passengers, depending on the rear seating you choose. Front- and all-wheel-drive are both available, and under the hood is a surprisingly powerful engine. The 3.3-liter V-6 produces 290 horsepower, a boon for those who tow. The standard features are fairly impressive, including a driver’s blind spot mirror, heated exterior mirrors, and LED headlight accents. The Limited model adds leather seating surfaces, a rearview camera, LED brake lights, and—a real reason to look at a new vehicles these days—the active safety features of blind spot detection with rear cross-traffic alert and lane change assist.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>New for 2016:</strong> Hands-free power liftgate added on Limited models;

Although the standard features make up a long enough list to satisfy the queen of England, there is an optional Ultimate package, too.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding.

The company refers to it as a safety seat for small dogs, created to restrain your dog in case of accidents or sudden stops. The website describes it as a giant catcher’s mitt, which is a perfect description. In case of an accident, the mitt catches the dog, and the car’s seatbelt system holds the seat in place.

But sometimes I must bring my husband along, and he prefers the front, so we tested the rear placement as well. Because of the shape of the Pupsaver, when Bizee is in the rear, I can't see her.

Although Lexus didn't give specifics, we encountered no chassis quivers in a day of driving the various RX models—RX350, RX450 Hybrid, and the F Sport versions of both. Lexus also invested in reducing interior noise levels, which is interesting, since the RX was already one of the more serene vehicles in this class.

The ride is still luxurious in most trim levels, particularly the standard RX with eighteen-inch wheels (higher trim levels have twenty-inch wheels). The F Sport version has a firmer setup with adaptive shock absorbers and multiple operating modes, giving the steering a little more sense of precision.

RLX stepped up its tech game for 2016, and luckily many of the bells and whistles now come standard. Acura has the slightly frustrating practice of distinguishing between models based on packages, so for the RLX there are the Navigation, Technology, and Advance packages. For 2016, the company has dropped two packages, and Navigation is now the base model. Now that we have that cleared up, let’s talk standard features. Navigation, rain-sensing wipers, power seats, and forward collision warning are included on all package levels, which is rather incredible. The options also include some cool features, such as front and rear parking sensors and a heated steering wheel. The RLX’s 3.5-liter V-6 produces 310 horsepower, and if you opt for the Sport Hybrid, a three-motor system with lithium-ion battery will deliver 377 horsepower. Despite all the power under the hood, this vehicle received five stars from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and was named a Top Safety Pick Plus, the highest accolade from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. There is no manual transmission available, but a seven-speed dual-clutch is found on the Sport Hybrid model. The RLX delivers luxury and performance without a BMW or Mercedes logo on the grille. You can decide whether that’s a good or bad thing.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>New for 2016:</strong> AcuraWatch expands scope and content of safety and driver assistive technologies<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura RLX Sport Hybrid.","fileMasterId":142426664,"fileName":"acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142426664/acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura RLX Sport Hybrid.","fileMasterId":142426661,"fileName":"acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142426661/acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura RLX Sport Hybrid.","fileMasterId":142426688,"fileName":"acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142426688/acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Acura RLX Sport Hybrid.","fileMasterId":142426685,"fileName":"acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/142426685/acura-rlx-sport-hybrid-2016-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More to Read:</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround/2016-acura-nsx-designer-walkaround/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Designer Walkaround: 2016 Acura NSX at the Detroit Auto Show</a> (with video)","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45301,"make":"Acura","model":"RLX","year":2016},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":46612,"make":"Acura","model":"RLX Hybrid","year":2016},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:38.441-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866318442 }} },{ "_id":696146,"title":"2016 Acura RDX","subTitle":"What more could you ask from a crossover?","slug":"2016-acura-rdx","promoTitle":"2016 Acura RDX","promoTeaserSmall":"What more could you ask from a crossover?","promoTeaser":"What more could you ask from a crossover?","keywords":["2016 Acura RDX"],"metaTitle":"2016 Acura RDX -

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-11T12:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-ia-promolarge","title":"Scion Ia Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/143363843/scion-ia-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":143363843,"fileName":"scion-ia-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-11T12:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-ia-promolarge","title":"Scion Ia Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/143363843/scion-ia-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":143363843,"fileName":"scion-ia-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-09-11T12:40:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"scion-ia-header","title":"Scion Ia Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/143363915/scion-ia-header.jpg","fileMasterId":143363915,"fileName":"scion-ia-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1624},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2553}}},"pages":[{"id":964588,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BxjkYK-ZkOA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":1,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, front-wheel-drive subcompact sedan<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $16,495 (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $18,184<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 1.5-liter four-cylinder, 106 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Six-speed manual <br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 31 mpg city/41 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> Not yet rated by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS)<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Rearview camera<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Navigation system ($419), door-sill protectors ($170)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> 2016 Chevrolet Sonic LS Manual ($15,170);

The HR-V has some of the great features you may already know from the Fit: the second-row Magic Seat that folds into the floor and makes the interior almost incomprehensibly roomy—58.8 cubic feet of cargo space, with the rear seats down—the long list of standard equipment, and the multi-angle rearview camera, along with LaneWatch active safety tech on the upper-level EX and EX-L Navi models.<br>\n<br>\nThis is still a small SUV and won't be a choice for someone who is eyeing a Chevrolet Suburban or a Range Rover, but it's got the all-wheel drive, practicality, and citified appeal that Honda fans will appreciate and small-crossover buyers will find very, very attractive.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>New for 2016:</strong> The HR-V is an all-new model.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>More to Read:</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/2016-honda-hr-v/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Should You Buy It? 2016 Honda HR-V</a>","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda HR-V.","fileMasterId":144439967,"fileName":"2016-Honda-HR-V-Rear.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/144439967/2016-Honda-HR-V-Rear.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda HR-V.","fileMasterId":144439955,"fileName":"2016-Honda-HR-V-Front.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/144439955/2016-Honda-HR-V-Front.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda HR-V.","fileMasterId":144439961,"fileName":"2016-Honda-HR-V-Int.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/144439961/2016-Honda-HR-V-Int.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda HR-V.","fileMasterId":144439952,"fileName":"2016-Honda-HR-V-Cargo-Area.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/144439952/2016-Honda-HR-V-Cargo-Area.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":44012,"make":"Honda","model":"HR-V","year":2016},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"71d39f07-0bc5-39bd-9468-12085dc13b7c","type":"mediaTag","name":"First_Car","path":"/Main/First_Car"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":true,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:40.547-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866320547 }} },{ "_id":697513,"title":"2017 Bentley Bentayga","subTitle":"An SUV to end all SUVs makes a splashy debut at the Frankfurt Auto Show.","slug":"2017-bentley-bentayga","promoTitle":"2017 Bentley Bentayga","promoTeaserSmall":"An SUV to end all SUVs makes a splashy debut at the Frankfurt Auto Show.","promoTeaser":"An SUV to end all SUVs makes a splashy debut at the Frankfurt Auto Show.","keywords":["2017 Bentley Bentayga"],"metaTitle":"2017 Bentley Bentayga -

More photos in the gallery at the end.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Wrangler Rubicon 03","caption":"","fileMasterId":144483836,"fileName":"wrangler-rubicon-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/144483836/wrangler-rubicon-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":3,"text":"<strong>Jeep Wrangler Rubicon Sunriser</strong><br>\nCheck out that sunrise-colored matte orange paint job, the four-inch suspension lift kit, and the double tow hooks on the front bumper.

Weighing significantly less than many its competitors, it can also do the old soft shoe. For 2015, the Azera gets a minor face lift and fanny tuck with a new grille and bumpers. The standard eighteen-inch wheels have been redesigned. And the sedan adds a standard hands-free trunk opener for convenience and blind-spot detection with rear cross-traffic alert and lane-change assist for safety. Climbing inside over newly illuminated door sill plates and settling into the heated and ventilated leather front seats, we find the redesigned center stack includes an eight-inch touchscreen that can split between navigation and audio functions. The 14-speaker sound system brings out all the tenderness of \"On the Street Where You Live.\" Included in the Azera Limited are a panoramic sunroof, power rear sunshade, manual rear side window sunshades, and ambient lighting.

Far more sumptuous than a prairie dog’s burrow, the interior includes heated and cooled leather front seats with the driver’s throne power-adjusting 12 ways from Sunday. To get really nutty, the Equus Ultimate has a 12.3-inch TFT instrument display and a head-up display, adds cooled rear seats (they’re already heated), powers up the rear head restraints, outboard lumbar supports, and side-window sun shades, and finally slaps in dual 9.2-inch entertainment system monitors.

Engine variants for this model include a 3.5-liter V-6 with 302 horsepower and a twin-turbo 2.1-liter four-cylinder diesel with 200 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque. Both engines are paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission, and while you can get the GLK350 with rear- or all-wheel drive, the diesel version is only available with the latter. At 18 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway, fuel economy is decent but not exceptional in the GLK350 4MATIC, although dropping AWD will improve the numbers by 1 mpg in both the city and highway ratings. To get a significant bump, you’ll have to opt for the diesel, if you can still find it. <br>\n<br>\nLegroom is a bit snug for rear passengers with only 35.1 inches to spread out and, despite its boxy hindquarters, the GLK-Class's cargo capacity is only 16.5 cubic feet with the rear seats up; that number jumps to 54.7 with the second row folded flat. Like most Mercedes-Benz vehicles, the GLK's interior is elegant, but most of the bells and whistles that many drivers have come to expect in new vehicles are optional features, such as navigation, a rearview camera, and a power liftgate. That usually isn’t much of a drawback for luxury buyers willing to shell out the extra thousands for the German crossover’s premium packages, but as with most end-of-cycle cars, they’ll probably have to take what they can get from what’s left on the lot.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nNo major changes.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz GLK-class interior","fileMasterId":128833844,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-glkclass-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/128833844/mercedesbenz-glkclass-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz GLK-class","fileMasterId":128833877,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-glkclass-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/128833877/mercedesbenz-glkclass-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz GLK-class","fileMasterId":128833841,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-glkclass-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/128833841/mercedesbenz-glkclass-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45260,"make":"Mercedes-Benz","model":"GLK-Class","year":2015},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:43.829-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866323829 }} },{ "_id":691896,"title":"2015 Mercedes-Benz G-Class","subTitle":"The intrepid classic soldiers on, inimitable and unforgettable.","slug":"2015-mercedes-benz-g-class","promoTitle":"2015 Mercedes-Benz G-Class","promoTeaserSmall":"The intrepid classic soldiers on, inimitable and unforgettable.","promoTeaser":"The intrepid classic soldiers on, inimitable and unforgettable.","keywords":["2015 Mercedes-Benz G-Class"],"metaTitle":"2015 Mercedes-Benz G-Class","metaKeywords":["2015 Mercedes-Benz G-class;

Both are paired with a seven-speed automatic transmission. With standard all-wheel drive, three sequentially lockable differentials, and eight inches of wheel travel, the G-Class boasts some serious off-road capabilities.

On that end, drivers will be pleased that it’s standard equipped with adaptive cruise control, blind-spot assist, a rearview camera, and parking assist sensors to help you squeeze into those tricky compact parking spaces.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nThere are no major changes to the G-Class for 2015.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz G-class interior","fileMasterId":127534928,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-gclass-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/127534928/mercedesbenz-gclass-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz G-class","fileMasterId":127534829,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-gclass-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/127534829/mercedesbenz-gclass-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz G-class","fileMasterId":127534925,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-gclass-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/127534925/mercedesbenz-gclass-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45224,"make":"Mercedes-Benz","model":"G-Class","year":2015},{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:44.069-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866324069 }} },{ "_id":691902,"title":"2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter","subTitle":"Commercial vehicle with versatility and appeal.","slug":"2015-mercedes-benz-sprinter","promoTitle":"2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter","promoTeaserSmall":"Commercial vehicle with versatility and appeal.","promoTeaser":"Commercial vehicle with versatility and appeal.","keywords":["2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter"],"metaTitle":"2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter","metaKeywords":["2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter;

The 2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is available as either a passenger (three row), crew (two row with cargo), or cargo van configuration, and offered with a 144- or 170-inch wheelbase. Buyers can choose from two turbo-diesel engines: the standard 161-horsepower, 2.1-liter 4-cylinder or a 188-horsepower, 3.0-liter V-6. Both are linked to a seven-speed automatic transmission. Although not technically an off-roader, it does have an available 4x4 drivetrain on both cargo and passenger versions equipped with the V-6, which makes it more capable in inclement weather. And because of its tall and top-heavy vehicle—especially if you choose the high roof option—buyers will appreciate the standard crosswind assist for additional stability. Optional safety features abound, including blind-spot assist, lane-keeping assist, and high beam assist. While a 5.8-inch color display and Bluetooth connectivity are standard, a rearview camera is optional. The interior has been nicely upgraded, but most of the outfitting in a Sprinter is bespoke and performed by what Mercedes calls a Preferred Upfitter, which means the sky—and your wallet—is the limit when it comes to customizing this van.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nCrosswind Assist has been added as a standard feature and all-wheel drive can now be optioned with the V-6 engine.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter","fileMasterId":127540484,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-sprinter-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/127540484/mercedesbenz-sprinter-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter","fileMasterId":127540655,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-sprinter-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/127540655/mercedesbenz-sprinter-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43879,"make":"Mercedes-Benz","model":"Sprinter","year":2015},{"id":"8bfe9141-264d-3530-adde-b612c376b580","type":"mediaTag","name":"Trucks","path":"/Main/Trucks"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:44.289-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866324291 }} },{ "_id":691895,"title":"2015 Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class","subTitle":"This could be what you are dreaming of when you dream of a Mercedes-Benz.","slug":"2015-mercedes-benz-slk-class","promoTitle":"2015 Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class","promoTeaserSmall":"This could be what you are dreaming of when you dream of a Mercedes-Benz.","promoTeaser":"This could be what you are dreaming of when you dream of a Mercedes-Benz.","keywords":["2015 Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class"],"metaTitle":"2015 Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class - JeanKnowsCars.com","metaKeywords":["2015 Mercedes-Benz SLK-class;

Airscarf, which blows warm air onto your neck, is optional rather than standard. The real tradeoff between the two models is in the performance and proportions. Engine options for the SLK include a 1.8-liter turbo 4-cylinder that produces 201 horsepower, a 3.5-liter V-6 with a 302-horsepower output, and the range-topping 415-horsepower 5.5-liter V-8.

only thing longer than the fuel range in the Hyundai Sonata is the list of trim levels.

In the Sport 2.0T and Limited 2.0T, the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder delivers a wild ride. Finally, the Hybrids bring even more efficiency to the party with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder that is paired with lithium-ion battery and electric motor. The one thing all of these models have in common? Impeccable value. The price starts at just over $20,000, and for that money you have access to standard features like remote keyless entry, cruise control, and driver’s blind spot mirror. For a bit more cash you can enjoy a heated steering wheel, hands-free Smart Trunk opener, and other less necessary options. Tree huggers on a budget will smile at the Hybrid models’ price tags.

This model was greeted with approval at its debut at the 2015 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Built on the same platform as Buick's Verano compact sedan, the Cascada is billed as large enough to fit four adults, with 13.4 cubic feet of storage space with the top up. As for the top, it's a folding electrohydraulic soft top that retracts in seventeen seconds at speeds up to 31 mph. Luxury features are many, including General Motors' increasingly ubiquitous 4G LTE wireless hot spot on board, a 7.0-inch touchscreen with GM's excellent IntelliLink infotainment system, 20-inch wheels, and heated front seats and steering wheel, all standard. Active safety features include lane departure warning, park assist, rain-sensing wipers, and a rearview camera.

The Verano has two engines available, a 2.4-liter four-cylinder that produces 180 horsepower and a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produces 250 horsepower. This power is kept neatly beneath Buick’s classic design and elegance, though. Luxury remains a selling point as standard features include dual-zone automatic climate control, eight-way power driver’s seat, and push-button start. Options take this luxury a bit further, providing a heated, leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated and leather-appointed seating, and  a rearview camera.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain.

There’s also good news for all of the stick-shifting fanatics out there; you can have a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmission. The 3 Series is highlighting its sportiness even further in 2016 as the Sport Line now comes standard on the Gran Turismo, 328i, 328d, and 340i (xDrive included). Speaking of standard, rain-sensing wipers, automatic headlights, and BMW Assist eCall all come standard. Unfortunately, you’ll have to pay for features like rearview camera, active blind spot alert, and navigation.

It’s as good looking as any entry in this segment, and it goes down the highway with real poise. It can be loaded up to a fare-thee-well with convenience and luxury features, but even the LX—the lowest trim level—comes standard with some key safety features like stability control, antilock brakes, and active front headrests. Naturally, all-wheel drive is available. The direct-injection, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine would at first glance seem to be insufficient, but indeed it’s up to the task of propelling this 3594-pound crossover. The direct-injection 3.3-liter V-6 definitely adds muscle, though, and towing capacity rises from 1650 to 3500 pounds. The Sorento is equipped with Flex Steer, which allows the driver to select the steering effort among comfort, normal, and sport modes. Inside, there’s a seven-inch instrument panel display and an eight-inch touchscreen for infotainment. Bluetooth connectivity is standard. Seating splits and folds every which way. The Sorento is tough to overlook because it has the right combination of appearance, performance, technology, and feature content.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThere are no changes for 2015.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Sorento interior","fileMasterId":103914974,"fileName":"kia-sorento-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103914974/kia-sorento-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Sorento","fileMasterId":103915076,"fileName":"kia-sorento-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103915076/kia-sorento-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Kia Sorento","fileMasterId":103915073,"fileName":"kia-sorento-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/103915073/kia-sorento-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Kia Sorento</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/you-auto-know/car-buying/2016-kia-sorento-sx-awd/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">2016 Kia Sorento SX AWD, Should You Buy It?</a> March 20, 2015","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":42575,"make":"Kia","model":"Sorento","year":2015},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:49.626-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866329627 }} },{ "_id":692068,"title":"6 Coolest Car Experiences in Europe","subTitle":"My favorites!

For example, the rear bumper’s integrated steps help with that reach to the top, where the aluminum roof rack supports up to 150 pounds and is shielded by an air dam. Rear-wheel drive is standard, but if you’re going somewhere with mountain bikes or camping gear, you’ll want the available four-wheel drive. Loading up for adventure is easy with 36.3 cubic feet of cargo capacity with rear seats up and 65.7 cubic seat with rear seats folded; the available Utili-track Cargo Channel system helps you to secure the payload. The Xterra is maneuverable and offers great visibility. While it doesn’t corner too well on the highway, it will crawl over some impressive offroad obstacles. Or it can be like a pair of oxen, towing up to 5,000 pounds.

The Titan is offered in extended King Cab or Crew Cab body styles with rear- or available 4-wheel drive. Boasting the largest standard engine among full-size pickups, this workhorse will tow up to 9,500 pounds. It includes traction control and stability control for surefire hill climbing and cornering on slick roads. The locking removable tailgate is a nifty standard feature, and the available locking bedside storage compartment and Utili-track cargo carrying system enhance the cargo box’s usefulness. Inside its cab, the Titan masters the pickup category’s mobile office requirements; the center-console’s workstation is as versatile and convenient as they come, and the front passenger seat folds flat for what serves as a desk. In back of either King or Crew Cab, the 60/40-split rear seats flip up to provide extra cargo space. The SV Value package puts the Titan on 20-inch wheels, hangs step rails on the cab, and places captain’s chairs in the front row. Then it piles on the infotainment and connectivity features. The PRO-4X girds the Titan for rock-busting duty, adding a transfer case skid plates, and high-performance shock absorbers.

It seats up to seven people with the available third-row bench, and the flexible interior layout provides up to 70.0 cubic feet of cargo space. Long pieces of cargo will fit, thanks to the flat-folding front seat folds flat. Wide-opening rear doors admit passengers to the back seats, the second row slides 9.0 inches and also reclines, and there are plenty of storage pockets. Comfort is a priority for front-seat occupants, as well, and the Rogue is available with advanced seat heaters that quickly warm the most strategic parts of the seat. The Rogue was all-new in 2014, and its advanced structural design leads to excellent safety ratings. It is available with a suite of contemporary driver assistance features, including 360-degree surround view, a class exclusive. Another point of pride is the excellent fuel economy. Under the hood, the 2.5-liter four-cylinder makes 170 horsepower, and paired with a continuously variable transmission—a competent and highly efficient powertrain. But because of the CVT, towing capacity is limited to just 1000 pounds. While being conventional in design, the Rogue is nicely detailed inside and out. Nissan still offers the previous-generation model as the Rogue Select S, a well-equipped value package that has an appealing $21,035 price tag (includes destination). \r\n \r\n<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nStandard satellite radio, NissanConnect with Mobile Apps connectivity, available Eco mode, heated cloth seats, new colors: Arctic Blue, Pearl White, Glacier White.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Nissan Rogue","fileMasterId":91978963,"fileName":"nissan-rogue-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91978963/nissan-rogue-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":2,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43258,"make":"Nissan","model":"Rogue","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45504,"make":"Nissan","model":"Rogue Select","year":2015},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:51.744-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866331744 }} },{ "_id":687283,"title":"2015 Nissan Sentra","subTitle":"Life on the upswing.","slug":"2015-nissan-sentra","promoTitle":"2015 Nissan Sentra","promoTeaserSmall":"Life on the upswing.","promoTeaser":"Life on the upswing.","keywords":["2015 Nissan Sentra"],"metaTitle":"2015 Nissan Sentra","metaKeywords":["2015 Nissan Sentra; Nissan; sedan; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"Life on the upswing.

As with other Nissan models, the body is aerodynamically efficient, and excellent fuel economy is the payoff, especially in the Sentra FE+ S, which incorporates underbody deflectors, a rear spoiler, and low rolling resistance tires to achieve 40 highway mpg. The 1.8-liter four-cylinder produces 130 horsepower, which is adequate if not exciting, and is paired with either a 6-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable automatic. The Sentra SV is loaded with infotainment and convenience features and now offers a Style Package that includes a power-operated sunroof, unique 16-inch alloy wheels, and a rear spoiler. Heated front seats and heated side mirrors are available for buyers in less than toasty climes.

Convenience, comfort, and capability are the Pathfinder’s hallmarks. It is available as a rear- or all-wheel-drive vehicle; for 2015, hill-descent control is included with the latter. A competent V-6 engine provides the power, and all Pathfinders now have an enhanced continuously variable transmission that makes less fuss while enabling the return of as much as 27 highway mpg.

It has a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and new continuously variable transmission, so fuel economy improves to 24 city mpg. Yet cargo capacity is impressive: 122.7 cubic feet. The cargo bay accepts a 40-by-48-inch pallet between the wheel wells, and a seven-foot-tall person could lie down in the cargo area (although he’d have to bend his neck a little to fit). The rear doors are split 60/40, with the smaller door opening to the traffic side of the street; both doors open to 180 degrees, resting flush against the van’s sides. The dual sliding side doors are solid for the company’s logo, but glass is available in all rear doors. Inside, standard cargo mounting points enable attachment of shelves, and six available floor-mounted cargo hooks help to keep things in place. Roof rack mounting points are standard. Inside, the driver will take advantage of Nissan’s “mobile office” center console, which stores a laptop or hanging file folders as well as the necessities one requires when spending long days in the vehicle. The front passenger seat slides 9.5 inches to extend cargo space, and the seat back folds flat to serve as a desk or picnic table.

It is available in Passenger and Cargo models, each of which is well conceived. They come with either V-6 or V-8 power and a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Passenger van has a 41.7-inch side opening and seats up to 12 occupants in four rows. The three rows to the aft have split benches, and the individual sections can be removed and repositioned. Nissan claims 324 different configurations. Each seating position has its own headrest and an integrated seatbelt, so there’s no “seatbelt jungle” that anyone who’s climbed onto an airport or hotel shuttle is familiar with. Rear passenger comfort is ensured, thanks to dual rotating overhead A/C vents and available reading lamps in each row. Heat vents are built into the floor. \n<br><br>\nAfter taking advantage of the cheaper-by-the-dozen offer at the drive-in, everyone will be happy to find that cupholders slide out from beneath the seat cushion. Up front, there are dual-zone climate controls and available heated seats. The infotainment system now incorporates a text-to-voice feature. Productivity is enhanced by the same central “mobile office” center console unit familiar from the Titan pickup. The van’s available rearview camera seems like an essential feature. Standing even taller beside the Passenger version, the NV Cargo is available in 1500, HD 2500, and HD 3500 grades and, like its sibling, S, SV, and SL trim. High-roof variants are available. The Cargo takes advantage of the same wide-opening rear doors, available third-row 12-volt outlet and cargo-area 120-volt outlet to run devices, tools, or accessories.

(The available power-folding rear seat is a nice feature.) Nissan’s smart all-wheel drive system is available with each trim level. A sufficiently powerful V-6 engine pairs up with a continuously variable automatic transmission that simulates a conventional gearbox’s shifting steps. And when it’s hitched to a 1500-pound utility trailer, the Murano might look like Goldilocks with a granny shopping cart, but it’ll do the job. Standard LED daytime running lights and “boomerang”-style tail lamps (originally introduced on Nissan 370Z) add flair. Inside, the experience is intended to be lounge-like, with an open center console making conversation easy between front and back rows. And the driver has an excellent outward view over the low, uncluttered instrument panel and dashboard. The Cashmere upholstery—cloth in the Murano S or SV, leather in the SL and Platinum—is something to behold.

(It was about 10 years ago.) The Juke’s unusual face and profile eventually work their charms, and then you’re won over by subtle details like the rear door handles, which are integrated into the doorframe. Standing tall on large wheels, this little hotrod is playful and insouciant. And then there’s the driving experience. The Juke punches above its weight with a direct-injection, turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, revised this year for better fuel economy, improved responsiveness, and lower emissions. It’s paired with a continuously variable transmission with a sport mode. Not only does the Juke bustle right down the road, but it also gives a Bronx cheer when passing gas stations. This five-seater is a front-wheel-drive vehicle with available all-wheel drive and up to 35.9 cubic feet of cargo space. The Juke S is well equipped with desirable feature content: connectivity and audio are strong points. The upmarket models add such items as a sunroof, leather, premium audio, and a 360-degree view. And you still haven’t spent a lot of money! The Nismo, names for Nissan’s motorsports arm rides on 18-inch wheels and a tuned suspension, and the Nismo RS is further endowed with a punchier 215 or 211 horsepower four—front- or all-wheel-drive models, respectively—stronger brakes, a braced chassis, and Recaro front bucket seats, taking the Juke into territory that’s not really shared with any other vehicle.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nProjector-headlamps with LED Accents, revised engine, standard smart key with pushbutton start, standard Bluetooth connectivity and hands-free texting, new colors: Solar Yellow, Cosmic Blue, Super Black.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Nissan Juke","fileMasterId":113942120,"fileName":"nissan-juke-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/113942120/nissan-juke-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Nissan Juke","fileMasterId":91976728,"fileName":"nissan-juke-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/91976728/nissan-juke-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Nissan Juke","fileMasterId":113942117,"fileName":"nissan-juke-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/113942117/nissan-juke-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":41523,"make":"Nissan","model":"Juke","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:53.538-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866333539 }} },{ "_id":687268,"title":"2015 Nissan GT-R","subTitle":"Nearly unlimited performance, limited availability.","slug":"2015-nissan-gt-r","promoTitle":"2015 Nissan GT-R","promoTeaserSmall":"Nearly unlimited performance, limited availability.","promoTeaser":"Nearly unlimited performance, limited availability.","keywords":["2015 Nissan GT-R"],"metaTitle":"2015 Nissan GT-R","metaKeywords":["2015 Nissan GT-R; Nissan; coupe; sports car; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"Nearly unlimited performance, limited availability.

Consider just a few examples. The stereo speakers are mounted in die-cast aluminum frames. Rather than iron sleeves, the V-6 engine’s cylinder bores have low-friction plasma coatings. The engine cover is a work of art, suitable for framing.  This year, much attention was given to retuning the suspension components and brakes with the goal of better drivability around town. Who knows? The lucky owner of a GT-R might utilize the 8.8 cubic feet of cargo capacity for a trip to Costco. Additional sound deadening measures have also been taken, and active noise cancellation counteracts booming from the twin-turbo V-6, which produces 545-horsepower (600-horsepower in the GT-R Nismo).  Being capable of 196 mph, the GT-R boasts one of the most aero-efficient bodies (0.26 cd) thanks in part to the carefully designed rear spoiler and undertrays, and now the GT-R Black Edition features a handmade, specially coated carbon-fiber spoiler. For that shopping trip, the driver might tame the GT-R with the 6-speed dual-clutch gearbox’s Normal or Save mode, and wait to use the paddle shifters and rev matching when R-Mode is engaged on track day. New for 2015 and typical of the obsessive details we mentioned, the available Regal Red body color blends 24-karat gold-coated glass flakes into the paint. And the Ivory Premium Package interior covers the seats in hand-stitched, semi-aniline leather, which is also applied on the instrument panel, steering wheel, and shift knob. The GT-R Black Edition has a red-and-black interior with leather-covered Recaro front bucket seats.

On the other hand, the four-wheel-drive Desert Runner has a more capable suspension, aggressive-looking alloy wheels, and a trendy decal. The basic S comes with antilock brakes and forward-facing rear seats that flip up to provide interior cargo space. A 5-speed automatic transmission is available in place of the manual. The SV and Desert Runner are offered in King or Crew Cab, and the SL is Crew Cab only. The list of features and amenities grows longer as the truck itself does: The SL Crew Cab stretches to 219.4 in length and the price tag stretches close to $40,000 when options like the sunroof and various accessories are thrown in.

He says, “The new Leaf is basically maintenance free and easy to live with. There’s quick acceleration at traffic speeds with no pesky downshifting. It has much better charging (faster) than the first generation, and the heat is much more efficient.” The Leaf seats five and, with the 60/40 split rear seat folded, up to 30 cubic-feet of cargo space. With an 84-mile range, the Leaf is effective as a commuter vehicle. It operates quietly. After applying benefits like tax incentives and access to the freeway’s diamond lane, the Leaf is less expensive, with greater added value, than you might think, especially because it never visits the gas pump. A quick-charge port allows recharging the lithium-ion battery pack to 80-percent level in 30 minutes with a fast charger. Only five hours is needed to achieve a full charge. In addition to being quiet to drive, the Leaf has a high level of standard. There’s a smart key with pushbutton start, a heated multifunction steering wheel and heated front and rear seats, and a rearview camera. Three driving modes are included: Normal, Eco-Mode, B-Mode, which has stronger regenerative braking capability to generate current. One other tip from our friend: the top-of-the-line SL with all the goodies can be a great deal because most buyers are frugal and economical.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nMorning Sky Blue paint, hands free texting in SV and SL, new 17-inch alloy wheels for SV trim.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Nissan Leaf","fileMasterId":113942450,"fileName":"nissan-leaf-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/113942450/nissan-leaf-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Nissan Leaf","fileMasterId":113942447,"fileName":"nissan-leaf-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/113942447/nissan-leaf-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43009,"make":"Nissan","model":"Leaf","year":2015},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:54.214-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866334215 }} },{ "_id":687264,"title":"2015 Nissan Armada","subTitle":"Serious heft and power for the serious family.","slug":"2015-nissan-armada","promoTitle":"2015 Nissan Armada","promoTeaserSmall":"Serious heft and power for the serious family.","promoTeaser":"Serious heft and power for the serious family.","keywords":["2015 Nissan Armada"],"metaTitle":"2015 Nissan Armada","metaKeywords":["2015 Nissan Armada;

It has a sports car’s classis front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. With a short 100.4-inch wheelbase and overall length of just 167.5 inches, you know it will get through the cones at your local autocross course. The 370Z has a highly aerodynamic body—the Sport and Sport Tech trim levels most of all. To keep down overall weight, aluminum is used in the hood, doors, and rear hatch. Power comes from a 3.7-liter V-6, which makes 332 horsepower (350 horsepower in the 370Z Nismo). The standard 6-speed manual gearbox can be ordered with a feature that blips the throttle for smooth downshifts. The available 7-speed automatic comes with a similar feature.

There are three engine choices, all connected to an eight-speed automatic transmission. You can stay connected in the X3 with enhanced USB and Bluetooth and Harman Kardon surround system, all of which come standard. You’ll have to shell out extra cash for the Driver Assistance Plus and Dynamic Handling packages, but on the bright side BMW has made some features like Smartphone integration and navigation systems less expensive.

its X5 lineup for 2016, and it’s just as stylish, spacious, and powerful as the other X5s. The gasoline-powered wagons’ engines range from 255 to 300 horsepower, and on the hybrid you’ll get a combined output of 308 horsepower. A green machine that goes from 0 to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds? Tempting. Moving away from the eco-friendly perks, though, the X5 offers 23 cubic feet of cargo space and collapsible seats, perfect for families or heavy packers. Although BMW will tempt you with options that can rack your bill up to close to six figures, the standard options should curb your cravings. Front and rear parking sensors, leather steering wheel, and 14-way power driver and front passenger seats with lumbar support all come standard on the X5. The bad news is you will have to pay for a rearview camera, head-up display, and blind-spot detection. That’s okay, though, you can wipe your tears with seats’ Canberra Beige leather.

A hatchback? A crossover? According to BMW, it's a Sports Activity Vehicle, and that might be the most suitable name for it.  Changes for 2016 are largely confined to electronics and feature upgrades. The 2016 xDrive50i now comes with four-zone automatic climate control and a one-year satellite radio subscription.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-12T09:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chrysler-200-homepage2","title":"Chrysler 200 Homepage2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/152351195/chrysler-200-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":152351195,"fileName":"chrysler-200-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-12T09:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chrysler-200-homepage2","title":"Chrysler 200 Homepage2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/152351195/chrysler-200-homepage2.jpg","fileMasterId":152351195,"fileName":"chrysler-200-homepage2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-12T09:19:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chrysler-200-header2","title":"Chrysler 200 Header2","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/152351048/chrysler-200-header2.jpg","fileMasterId":152351048,"fileName":"chrysler-200-header2.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":968868,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, all-wheel-drive compact sedan<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> Front-wheel drive: LX, Limited S, C; All-wheel drive: S, C <br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $30,540 (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $33,525<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.6-liter V-6, 295 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Nine-speed automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 18 mpg city/29 mpg highway <br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: 5/5 stars; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: Top Safety Pick Plus (2015)<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Park View rearview camera<br>\n<strong>Options I can’t live without:</strong> Heated front seats and steering wheel; Uconnect Access on-board Wi-Fi hot spot<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Sport suspension, ambient LED lighting, tilting and telescoping steering wheel, leather-wrapped steering wheel, LED taillamps<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> Navigation and Sound group ($1,495) includes 8.4-inch infotainment touchscreen, navigation, SiriusXM Traffic, Harman HD radio, 7.0-inch driver information screen, Alpine 506-watt amplifer, Uconnect Wi-Fi hot spot; Comfort group ($895) includes heated front seats and steering wheel, remote start<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering</strong> (prices include destination charge): <br>\n2016 Ford Fusion SE AWD ($29,345)<br>\n2016 Subaru Legacy 3.6R ($29,945)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Chrysler 200 13","caption":"","fileMasterId":152324402,"fileName":"chrysler-200-13.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/152324402/chrysler-200-13.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":1302},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":2047}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Shopping for a new car can be fun, but it can also be overwhelming.</strong> There are far more possible choices in the mid-size sedan category than you will ever have the patience to test drive—or even fully research.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Jean","firstName":"Molly","lastName":"Jean","jobTitle":"Senior Editor","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"When I turned sixteen, my dad brought home the very first-generation Ford Escort wagon, and it just so happened to have a manual transmission. Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Teenagers","id":1034773,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/kids-in-the-car/teenagers","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Kids in the Car","id":1034769,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/kids-in-the-car","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-18T20:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-homepage","title":"Insurance Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/154203842/insurance-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":154203842,"fileName":"insurance-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-18T20:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-homepage","title":"Insurance Homepage","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/154203842/insurance-homepage.jpg","fileMasterId":154203842,"fileName":"insurance-homepage.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-10-18T20:02:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"insurance-header","title":"Insurance Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/154203833/insurance-header.jpg","fileMasterId":154203833,"fileName":"insurance-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":966797,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"School is in session.

The time to do your insurance homework is well before your child drives away from the DMV with his or her license. I personally was not so smart.

Start early.</strong> When your student starts driver ed, begin exploring insurance for your young driver. Compile a list of questions to ask potential insurance companies.

There are good statistical reasons why new drivers pay high premiums, but many companies let you reduce that a bit with a financial incentive for a good grade-point average. This usually applies to both high school and college students, including homeschoolers, but make sure to confirm. Each company has its own age restrictions—State Farm grants the discount until the twenty-fifth birthday, even after a student has earned a degree.

That could mean good deals at the showroom. The Fortwo is available in three models: Pure, Passion, and Electric Drive. The Pure is about as basic as any car currently in the market, with manually adjustable mirrors, crank windows, and power steering as an option. Safety is lavishly attended to, though, and there are eight air bags as well as standard electronic stability control and anti-lock brakes. The Passion coupe adds a sunroof, power windows and mirrors, alloy wheels, a decent radio, and available heated leather seats. The Passion cabriolet has an automatic convertible top with a glass rear window. The Electric Drive is also available as a coupe or cabriolet, and the coupe comes with a sunroof.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

2016 Cadillac ATS is the Cadillac aesthetic, writ small. For the price of an ordinary sedan, you can get the lively styling and the invigorating driving credentials of a Cadillac, and that's the whole point of the ATS. For 2016, there's an all-new 3.6-liter V-6 with cylinder deactivation and stop/start technology to save fuel. Even bigger news is the arrival of the twin-turbo ATS-V performance version as a coupe or sedan, upping the ATS desirability level considerably. You get a choice of normally aspirated or turbocharged four-cylinder engines along with that V-6, and there are sedan and coupe body styles to choose from. All engines come with an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters. On the ATS-V, a six-speed manual transmission is standard, while the eight-speed automatic is a $2,000 option.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Cadillac Ats V Sedan 2","caption":"","fileMasterId":147659240,"fileName":"cadillac-ats-v-sedan-2.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/147659240/cadillac-ats-v-sedan-2.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"inlinewithtext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":2,"text":"Much of the enjoyment of this car, of course, will come from personalizing it.
