Results? For the first two months of 2015, comparing year-over-year sales, the TLX outsold the other two models combined. \n<br><br>\nOf course, it helps that the TLX has a lot to recommend it. Positioned between the entry ILX and the flagship RLX, the TLX delivers a mix of sportiness and luxury. There are two available powertrains, a four-cylinder with an eight-speed automatic transmission and a V-6 with a nine-speed auto. All-wheel steering is standard with front-wheel drive models, and all-wheel drive is optional with the V-6 engine. The base TLX comes well equipped, with heated seats and side mirrors, a power moonroof, satellite radio, and LED head- and taillights. For even more features, such as navigation with 3D view and HD Radio, you can upgrade to the Technology and Advance packages\n<br><br>\nSlightly smaller than the TL, the TLX is built on an all-new platform, and the body is made of rigid, lightweight materials that emphasize driving dynamics and collision safety. In addition, wind, road, and engine noise have been reduced compared with the TL, thanks to triple door seals and extra body sealing and sound-absorbing materials. All TLXs also feature Acura’s Integrated Dynamics System (IDS), which offers four modes – Econ, Normal, Sport, and Sport+ — for drivers to adjust steering firmness, throttle response, and shifting patterns.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"\r\n<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nThe TLX is an all-new model for 2015.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Acura TLX","fileMasterId":119694374,"fileName":"acura-TLX-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119694374/acura-TLX-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Acura TLX","fileMasterId":119694332,"fileName":"acura-TLX-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119694332/acura-TLX-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Acura TLX","fileMasterId":119694371,"fileName":"acura-TLX-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/119694371/acura-TLX-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the Acura TLX</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/jeans-driveway/designer-walkaround/acura-tsx-prototype/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Designer Walkaround Video: Acura TLX Prototype</a> March 17, 2014, with Jean Jennings","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":40648,"make":"Acura","model":"TLX","year":2015},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":7},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:45.644-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866265645 }} },{ "_id":689253,"title":"2015 Acura RDX","subTitle":"Comfort, performance, utility.","slug":"2015-acura-rdx","promoTitle":"2015 Acura RDX","promoTeaserSmall":"Comfort, performance, utility.","promoTeaser":"Comfort, performance, utility.","keywords":["2015 Acura RDX"],"metaTitle":"2015 Acura RDX","metaKeywords":["2015 Acura RDX; Acura; crossover; sport-utility; SUV; Japanese"],"metaDescription":"Comfort, performance, utility.

However, that hasn’t discouraged Honda’s upscale division, which continues to add features to the RLX to elevate its level of technology and sophistication. There are four trim levels/packages—Navigation, Technology, Advance, and Krell Audio—and one powertrain, a 310-horsepower V-6 mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. There is also a Sport Hybrid version, but it is not technically a 2015 model. It continues to be sold in dealerships, but since it came out late in the 2014 model year, it continues with that designation. The hybrid powertrain produces 377 horsepower and gets 30 mpg in combined city/highway driving. A redesigned Sport Hybrid with all-wheel drive is scheduled to go on sale for 2016.\n<br><br>\nThe RLX doesn’t carry the prestige of its European competitors, nor does it have their wider selection of powertrains. Driving the RLX is not a revelation, either, but its V-6 engine powerful enough, and it delivers a smooth ride. Where the RLX excels is with its spacious interior, which has generous legroom for back-seat passengers and features a wide array of high-tech features. Forward-collision and lane-departure warning systems and a multi-view rear camera are standard, and a collision mitigation braking system and lane-keeping assist are available. Also available with the Advance package is an adaptive cruise control system with low-speed follow, which automatically slows the car without any input from the driver when traffic necessitates braking.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

My dog, Clem, immediately thrusts his head out the open window and lets his big pink tongue hang out while the wind pushes his floppy ears back. When we arrive at the drive-through, I order and pull forward to greet the friendly cashier, who happens to have a soft spot for Clem. Okay, maybe he loves all dogs, but I prefer to think Clem is special. The cashier hands me my strawberry ice cream and, because, the Baskin-Robbins is connected to a Dunkin' Donuts, he also feeds a leftover doughnut hole to Clem. At this point, my dog has half his body out of the car window. We love this ritual and drive away happy as clams, but I haven't really thought about any safety implications for my pup. Heck, if I had a dime for every time Clem or our other six-month-old black Lab, Brick, jumped into my lap, crawled over a seat, or unknowingly tried to climb out the window while I was driving, I’d be a wealthy woman.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":3,"text":"<h3>I Thought My Dog Crate Was Crash Tested?</h3>\nPet crate manufacturers have increasingly labeled their products as “crash tested,” but what does that really mean?

But it’s still a plug-in hybrid, which means that at the push of a button, it can operate on electric-only mode and responsibly motor around town emitting nary a tailpipe emission. With the gasoline engine disengaged, the i8 offers a pure EV range of approximately 22 miles and a top speed of 75 mph, but when making full use of its electric motors and its three-cylinder, 1.5-liter gasoline engine, the coupe produces an output of 357 horsepower and maxes out at an electronically controlled top speed of 155 mph while still getting an average combined fuel economy of 76 mpg. If you’ve drained the lithium-ion battery, you can expect an estimated 29 mpg when using only the gasoline engine. There are four different trim packages—the limited-edition Pure Impulse World is the most expensive at $10,800—each with its own interior trim options.

To that end, the 4-series fits the bill. Its sportiness is emphasized with an elongated, athletic exterior and a more rigid chassis than the 3-series. Mucking up the formula a bit is the recently introduced 4-Series Gran Coupe, which gets four doors but retains the fastback styling of the coupe. Although the 4-series and 3-series models share the same turbocharged 2.0-liter in-line-four and turbocharged 3.0-liter in-line-six engines, the 4-series wheelbase is bit longer, its body wider, and roof lower than its compact sedan sibling, which results in a more dynamic driving machine that feels firmly connected to the road. Rounding out the different driving characteristics is the standard speed-sensitive steering— variable-assist sport steering and adaptive suspension are available as part of the optional dynamic handling package. Optional technology is available on every aspect of the 4-series, from the Comfort Access that opens the trunk with a small foot movement under the center of the rear bumper, to the pedestrian detection, speed limit sign detection, collision avoidance, head-up display, and Google search-based points-of-interest for the navigation system. Rear seats in the Gran Coupe hatchback have a 40/20/40 split help make the most of cargo capacity.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nRevised package features, new leather and material options, Comfort Access now includes the hands-free trunk closing function, and the Gran Coupe and M4 models are all new.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 4-series interior","fileMasterId":124062068,"fileName":"BMW-4series-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124062068/BMW-4series-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 4-series","fileMasterId":124062065,"fileName":"BMW-4series-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124062065/BMW-4series-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 4-series","fileMasterId":124062062,"fileName":"BMW-4series-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124062062/BMW-4series-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>More about the BMW 4 Series</h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.jeanknowscars.com/life-with-jean/the-lunacy/what-i-drove-last-weekend-bmw-4-series/\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\">What I Drove Last Weekend: BMW 4 Series</a> February 18, 2015","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":42478,"make":"BMW","model":"4-Series","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":39746,"make":"BMW","model":"M4","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":5},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:49.012-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866269013 }} },{ "_id":690789,"title":"2015 BMW 7 Series","subTitle":"Stately sedan.","slug":"2015-bmw-7-series","promoTitle":"2015 BMW 7 Series","promoTeaserSmall":"Stately sedan.","promoTeaser":"Stately sedan.","keywords":["2015 BMW 7 Series"],"metaTitle":"2015 BMW 7 Series","metaKeywords":["2015 BMW 7-series; BMW; sedan; hybrid; diesel; Alpina B7; German"],"metaDescription":"Stately sedan.

Chrysler redesigned the 200 for 2015 with an eye toward making it a real competitor. To that end, it has some segment-exclusive features, such as a nine-speed transmission that shifts almost imperceptibly as it transfers the power from the engine to the wheels. There are two available engines, a perfectly adequate if not exactly inspiring four-cylinder and a 295-horsepower V-6 that produces more power than is found in any other family sedan. The 200 is also one of the few vehicles in the segment that offers all-wheel drive (along with the Ford Fusion and the Subaru Legacy).<br><br>The exterior styling of the new 200 is much sleeker than the previous generation, and the interior is more modern and inviting—the rotary gearshift knob might even remind you of being in a Jaguar.

The design allows the 6.3-liter V-12—and that’s a big chunk of aluminum—to sit behind the front axle, a layout that keeps the car from being nose-heavy and pushy in the turns.

But fold the rear seats fold flat, and this is a Ferrari that wants to go for landscaping supplies. An independently opening middle section enables the insertion of skis or a single golf bag with the seats in place. Persons as tall as 6 feet 1 inch will find the rear comfortable.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

The all-new 2015 BMW X6 retains the same 6-Series-inspired styling cues as the outgoing model, such as the fastback roofline and shorter rear doors, but the interior redesign fixes some of the vehicle’s earlier shortcomings. One of the most noticeable changes is that the X6 has increased its seating capacity from four to five. The first-generation vehicle sat only two in the rear, and the second row now can seat three across. Front and rear passengers will enjoy a bit more headroom, and while legroom is unchanged for the front row, the rear passengers will have two inches more to stretch their legs. But that extra legroom comes at a cost: namely, cargo capacity. The 2015 X6’s cargo capacity is down five cubic feet from the previous generation—now 20.5 cubic feet—and is less than that of the X1. But buyers tend to shop the X6 more for its advantageous forward view and agile performance than its practicality, which is reflected in the new rear-wheel-drive sDrive35i.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nThe X6 is all new for 2015.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW X6 interior","fileMasterId":124077386,"fileName":"BMW-X6-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124077386/BMW-X6-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW X6","fileMasterId":124077449,"fileName":"BMW-X6-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124077449/BMW-X6-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW X6","fileMasterId":124077377,"fileName":"BMW-X6-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124077377/BMW-X6-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":43753,"make":"BMW","model":"X6","year":2015},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:52.307-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866272307 }} },{ "_id":690809,"title":"2015 BMW X5","subTitle":"Performance family hauler.","slug":"2015-bmw-x5","promoTitle":"2015 BMW X5","promoTeaserSmall":"Performance family hauler.","promoTeaser":"Performance family hauler.","keywords":["2015 BMW X5"],"metaTitle":"2015 BMW X5","metaKeywords":["2015 BMW X5; BMW; SUV; sport-utility; crossover; diesel; German"],"metaDescription":"Performance family hauler.

This rear-wheel-drive subcompact is available as a coupe or convertible, and it delivers excellent driving dynamics, performance, fuel economy, and technology in a smaller package than its 3 Series sibling. On the downside, it seats only four. But buyers are more likely buying this car for its engineering than its people shuttling and cargo capacity (which at almost 14 cubic feet is quite good), and they’ll be pleased with its standard turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces a more than ample 240 horsepower. It’s also one of the dwindling stock of rear-wheel-drive vehicles available with a six-speed manual transmission, and yet for the winter-weather dwellers, it’s also offered with xDrive. The interior is high end, but you’ll pay extra for most bells and whistles. Dual-zone climate control and a 6.5-inch LCD screen are standard, but navigation, a rearview camera, park assist, a cruise control system with braking function, and phone and app integration are all extra. Performance-minded buyers can bump up to the M—also still available with a manual transmission—and get the turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine that produces 320 horsepower and 330 pound-feet of torque, producing an impressive power-to-weight ratio. M-specific braking, exhaust, suspension, and chassis tuning complete this tight little package.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3> \r\nBMW’s intelligent all-wheel-drive system available on the 228i xDrive Coupe and the M235i xDrive models; newly available Track Handling package.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 2-series interior","fileMasterId":124058882,"fileName":"BMW-2series-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124058882/BMW-2series-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 2-series","fileMasterId":124058879,"fileName":"BMW-2series-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124058879/BMW-2series-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 2-series","fileMasterId":124058756,"fileName":"BMW-2series-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124058756/BMW-2series-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 2-series","fileMasterId":124058747,"fileName":"BMW-2series-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124058747/BMW-2series-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45382,"make":"BMW","model":"2-Series","year":2015},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"751849cc-3a2a-3623-bc2f-d39a5f3f7820","type":"mediaTag","name":"Convertible","path":"/Main/Convertible"},{"id":"dc86f92d-1b2a-385f-b89a-07d1a8807ab7","type":"mediaTag","name":"Coupe","path":"/Main/Coupe"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:53.274-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866273274 }} },{ "_id":690781,"title":"2015 BMW 3 Series","subTitle":"The most-awarded performance sedan.","slug":"2015-bmw-3-series","promoTitle":"2015 BMW 3 Series","promoTeaserSmall":"The most-awarded performance sedan.","promoTeaser":"The most-awarded performance sedan.","keywords":["2015 BMW 3 Series"],"metaTitle":"2015 BMW 3 Series","metaKeywords":["2015 BMW 3 Series; BMW; sedan; wagon; Gran Coupe; coupe; M3; hybrid; German"],"metaDescription":"The most-awarded performance sedan.

All this is to say that with its much-lauded dynamics, comfort, and performance, BMW has set the benchmark for performance sedans, and every manufacturer has it in its crosshairs. But beating BMW at its own game will be tough, since buyers can basically configure their 3 Series any way they like it. Shoppers can choose the sedan, wagon, or long wheel base hatchback, select either the standard rear-wheel drive or xDrive, choose a manual or automatic transmission, and pick from six engine options including a diesel and a hybrid, or go with the M3. You will pay dearly for all of these models, and that’s before you add your driver assistance and comfort packages, like navigation, a color head-up display, app integration, heated front and rear seats and steering wheel, a rearview camera, or adaptive headlights. But with its premium price come premium finishes. The interior is decidedly refined and spacious; the Luxury, Sport, and M Sport trim lines set different style tones; and a host of optional packages can make it one of the most technically advanced sedans out there. But any way it’s kitted out, it remains an attainable daily driver that has the versatility to switch instantly to a track car with a few setting changes.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nRevised package features, new leather and material options, Comfort Access now includes the hands-free trunk closing function, and the M3 model is all new.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 3-series interior","fileMasterId":124060781,"fileName":"BMW-3series-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124060781/BMW-3series-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 3-series","fileMasterId":124060874,"fileName":"BMW-3series-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124060874/BMW-3series-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 3-series","fileMasterId":124060775,"fileName":"BMW-3series-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124060775/BMW-3series-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 BMW 3-series","fileMasterId":124060772,"fileName":"BMW-3series-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/124060772/BMW-3series-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":42790,"make":"BMW","model":"3-Series","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":39787,"make":"BMW","model":"M3","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45869,"make":"BMW","model":"ActiveHybrid 3","year":2015},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:17:53.533-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866273533 }} },{ "_id":690787,"title":"2015 BMW 6 Series","subTitle":"The winner’s coupe.","slug":"2015-bmw-6-series","promoTitle":"2015 BMW 6 Series","promoTeaserSmall":"The winner’s coupe.","promoTeaser":"The winner’s coupe.","keywords":["2015 BMW 6 Series"],"metaTitle":"2015 BMW 6 Series","metaKeywords":["2015 BMW 6-series; BMW; coupe; convertible; Gran Coupe; M6; Alpina B6; hatchback; German"],"metaDescription":"The winner’s coupe.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-11T09:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chrysler-300-promolarge","title":"Chrysler 300 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/113939942/chrysler-300-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":113939942,"fileName":"chrysler-300-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-11T09:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chrysler-300-promolarge","title":"Chrysler 300 Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/113939942/chrysler-300-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":113939942,"fileName":"chrysler-300-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-11T09:29:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chrysler-300-header","title":"Chrysler 300 Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/113939939/chrysler-300-header.jpg","fileMasterId":113939939,"fileName":"chrysler-300-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":948964,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, all-wheel-drive full-size sedan<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $34,890 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $37,580 (including destination charge)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.6-liter V-6, 292 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Eight-speed automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 18 mpg city/27 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>My favorite standard feature:</strong> Analog clock on dash<br>\n<strong>Notable standard features on this model:</strong> Uconnect infotainment with 8.5-inch touchscreen, leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated front seats, leather seating, rotary shifter, chrome-trimmed LED taillamps, dual rear exhaust<br>\n<strong>Notable options on this model:</strong> LED foglamps, rearview camera, remote start (part of Driver Convenience package, $1,695); Navigation, HD and SiriusXM radio (part of Uconnect Navigation package, $995)<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering:</strong> 2015 Toyota Avalon, 2015 Chevrolet Impala, 2015 Hyundai Genesis, 2015 Kia Cadenza, 2015 Nissan Maxima (all prices include destination charges)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Chrysler 300 06","caption":"","fileMasterId":113939861,"fileName":"chrysler-300-06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/113939861/chrysler-300-06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Postmodern art and minimalist design are all well and good.</strong> Comic-book colors and bulbous designs have their place.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"At Home","id":1034951,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/jeans-driveway/at-home","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Jean's Driveway","id":1034950,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/jeans-driveway","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-11T19:41:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"toyota-prius-promolarge","title":"Toyota Prius Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/114029660/toyota-prius-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":114029660,"fileName":"toyota-prius-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-11T19:41:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"toyota-prius-promolarge","title":"Toyota Prius Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/114029660/toyota-prius-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":114029660,"fileName":"toyota-prius-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-05-11T19:41:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"toyota-prius-header","title":"Toyota Prius Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/92019565/toyota-prius-header.jpg","fileMasterId":92019565,"fileName":"toyota-prius-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":949993,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRYX0lmp7Qo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger hybrid hatchback<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong>  $26,590 (including destination)<br>\n<strong>Price as tested:</strong> $28,315 (including destination)<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 1.8-liter four-cylinder/electric motor/nickel-metal hydride battery, 134 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Continuously variable automatic<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Toyota Prius 01","caption":"","fileMasterId":114029513,"fileName":"toyota-prius-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/114029513/toyota-prius-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Safety ratings:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Search-Results?searchtype=model&make=TOYOTA&model=PRIUS&year=2015\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">4/5 stars</a>;

With the available 3.6-liter V-6 making 283 horsepower, it’s more powerful than the competition. But more than anything, it represents a good value. Start with the Journey AVP (American Value Package) for $21,290. The long list of standard convenience features includes keyless entry with push-button start, dual-zone climate control, a USB port, and an auxiliary input jack. Then there are the abundant driver assistance and safety features: traction control, brake assist, and active front head restraints among them. The Journey AVP options packages bring more advanced connectivity as well as three-zone climate control and adaptable seating, all without driving the price too high. When compared with the more expensive compact crossovers, though, the Journey is behind the times with the standard powertrain. Not that the 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine isn’t up to snuff, but we look for a six-speed automatic instead of the four-speed automatic found here—especially because this rig weighs in at a thumping 3,818 pounds. (The V-6 with six-speed automatic and all-wheel drive weighs 4,238.) For 2015, the Journey Crossroad, which has a rugged off-road look, is outfitted with black nineteen-inch alloy wheels and leather-trimmed seats with mesh inserts and gray stitching.

The Dart SXT, Limited, and GT are powered by a sophisticated 2.4-liter four-cylinder that makes 184 horsepower and better positions the models against competitors. For 2015, there are optional modifications to the fuel supply system to gain Partial Zero Emission Vehicle status for Darts in the fourteen California Air Resources Board states. The Dart Aero has a turbocharged 1.4-liter four-cylinder that can be matched with a six-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, taking advantage of the strong output of 160 horsepower and—best of the Dart bunch—184 pound-feet of torque. The Aero has active grille shutters and special underbody cladding to improve aerodynamic efficiency. (The active shutters are also standard on the GT and Limited and optional on SE and SXT.) A special badge and LED “racetrack” taillamps help distinguish the Aero.

Electrically assisted power steering offers Normal, Comfort, and Sport modes, as conditions warrant. Buying an SRT model makes you eligible for the SRT Track Experience to explore your car’s potential. A suite of driver assistance and safety features is available. Heated front seats are standard on most models. The optional ten-speaker audio system yields in SRT models to the nineteen-speaker Harman Kardon orchestra.

Since—like every other sixteen-year-old—I knew everything, I was sure that I would just get behind the wheel and effortlessly shift gears. Visions of screeching into the school parking lot with my shiny red \"world car\" and impressing all the burnouts who hung out near their Detroit muscle cars danced in my head. \n\nAll of those dreams were quickly extinguished in the first fifteen minutes of my driving lesson from my dad. Although he has a teaching certificate, patience is not his strongest skill. The subtle foot-hand coordination escaped me, and we were jerking around the subdivision like the contestants in a game of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_%28game%29 rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Red Light Green Light</a>. I blamed my dad, and he blamed me. To my astonishment, he decided it was best to abandon ship and allow me to figure out how to get home. Somehow I managed to limp home without needing therapy for whiplash. After our wounds had healed I did end up learning to drive a manual on that trusty steed.\n\nI ended up driving my Escort to Northern Michigan University in Marquette, in Michigan’s frigid Upper Peninsula, where I obtained a BFA, with a concentration in Graphic Design, and a future husband. I joined <em>Automobile Magazine</em> at the tender age of twenty-eight and fell in love with the energy and passion for automobiles and the way they enhance our lives. Later, I took a five-year hiatus and boned up my design and web skills and am now turbocharged to be a part of the Jean Knows Cars team.\n\nMany years have passed, and now my sixteen-year-old only child is poised to learn to drive a manual, and I can’t help but be transported back to my teens. Unlike my parents, I am a helicopter mom. Riding in the passenger's seat with her behind the wheel is like waterboarding. I want to order her to pull over and allow me to drive and throw her in the back seat with airbags strapped directly on her. Many of her peers will not learn to drive a manual, but I believe that it is the building block for a good safe driver. It is a perfect synergy watching my daughter learn to drive and helping Jean Knows Cars celebrate and embrace the automobile and how it is woven into our lives.","fileMasterId":48719952,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/48719952/48719952.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":1172,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"molly.jean@sorc.com"}],"websiteIds":[6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-06-26T06:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevy-cruze-promolarge","title":"Chevy Cruze Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/126179948/chevy-cruze-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":126179948,"fileName":"chevy-cruze-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-06-26T06:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevy-cruze-promolarge","title":"Chevy Cruze Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/126179948/chevy-cruze-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":126179948,"fileName":"chevy-cruze-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-06-26T06:10:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"chevy-cruze-promolarge","title":"Chevy Cruze Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/126179948/chevy-cruze-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":126179948,"fileName":"chevy-cruze-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}}},"pages":[{"id":955972,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>The 2016 Chevrolet Cruze will not be in showrooms until early 2016,</strong> but, like the plethora of presidential candidates we're already seeing, it has hit the campaign trail a little bit early.

All-wheel drive is an option with the V-6 in either body style. But in the sedan, our experience leads to a preference for the smooth, powerful V-8 in the sedan.

It’s not quite cavernous inside, like the Equus, but it’s roomier than most of its direct competitors. The interior is gorgeous with available matte wood trim, aluminum accents, and leather upholstery that will continually delight. The Sedan 5.0 has standard heated and cooled front seats. (Heated rear seats are only available in the Sedan 3.8 with all-wheel drive, which also can be ordered with a heated steering wheel.)

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

The MultiFlex rear seat system lets you easily arrange the back to suit your passengers or cargo.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

Woody Harrelson (shown here) was the most amusing celebrity. \nHe crashed a racing car while learning to drive it at Willow Springs, rolling the car nine times and ending up in the hospital.

Legroom is mercifully spacious in every row of this luxury liner, with 40.3-, 38.5-, and 35.0-inches in the front, second, and third rows, respectively.  Cargo capacity isn’t lacking despite its three-row configuration with 16 cubic feet of storage with all three rows in use and 49.4 cubic feet with the third row folded flat: plenty of room to tote around that double wide jogging stroller and the dog. True to its luxury brand, it’s well equipped with many standard creature comforts and safety features, such as heated front seats, the Comand infotainment system, a power liftgate, a drowsy driving warning system. Extras include parking assist, a panoramic sunroof, a heated steering wheel, surround-view camera, and most important, a rear-seat entertainment system, which is a good way to keep the cabin quiet so you can enjoy this SUV’s hushed ride.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nThe GL450 gets a twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 engine; stop/start is now standard on GL450 and GL63 AMG.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz GL-class interior","fileMasterId":127535879,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-glclass-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/127535879/mercedesbenz-glclass-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz GL-class","fileMasterId":127535720,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-glclass-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/127535720/mercedesbenz-glclass-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz GL-class","fileMasterId":127535696,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-glclass-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/127535696/mercedesbenz-glclass-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":44883,"make":"Mercedes-Benz","model":"GL-Class","year":2015},{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:04.131-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866284132 }} },{ "_id":691238,"title":"2015 Ford Focus SE","subTitle":"What America drives...and why.","slug":"2015-ford-focus-se","promoTitle":"2015 Ford Focus SE","promoTeaserSmall":"What America drives...and why.","promoTeaser":"What America drives...and why.","keywords":["2015 Ford Focus SE"],"metaTitle":"2015 Ford Focus SE","metaKeywords":["2015 Ford Focus SE","Ford Focus","Ford sedan","Ford cars","Ford",""],"metaDescription":"What America drives...and why.","websiteId":6202044,"publicationDate":"2015-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","printCoverDate":"2015-07-06T15:07:00.000Z","releaseDate":"2015-06-22T15:07:00.000Z","eventYear":0,"articleType":"","webExclusive":false,"url":"/you-auto-know/car-buying/2015-ford-focus-se/","canBeGallery":true,"contributors":[{"id":10412,"roles":["Writer"],"displayName":"Jean Jennings","firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Jennings","jobTitle":"Editor in Chief","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"Jean Knows Cars is not just the name of this website; it's a true fact. I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

Make the right decisions when you rent.</h3> \nTo be covered by your credit card, you first have to decline the “collision damage waiver,” or insurance policy, offered at the rental counter. You also have to charge the entire rental on the card. Most cards have some stipulations regarding what they will pay for based on where and what you drive. None of the networks offers coverage for trucks, sports cars, or large vans, and three out of four will not cover vehicles priced over $50,000. There are other rules, like Visa’s regulation that excludes accidents that happen on dirt or gravel roads, and AmEx’s refusal to cover big SUVs like the Ford Expedition and the Toyota Land Cruiser.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":4,"text":"<h3>3. Know what is meant by “covered damages.”</h3>\r\nTire or rim damage or destruction? It’s covered by American Express, MasterCard, and Discover, but not by Visa. If you need your rental card towed, all four card companies will cover that, although you should check with your card issuer to find out about distance limitations. Loss of use and the deductible on your own insurance policy are covered by every company except Discover. American Express offers a “premium” level of coverage, for damages up to $50,000 or $75,000, depending on which card you have, for a small added fee. ","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<h3>4.

You might find it difficult, as we did, to get a clear picture of the cost by searching rental company websites. To get exact numbers for the rental you are about to sign up for, you should expect to ask for it directly from the rental agency when you sign the rental contract.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well.

The base model, the CLA250, is equipped with front-wheel drive—all-wheel drive is optional—and a 2.0-liter four-cylinder that produces 208 horsepower. Price-wise, it may be the most accessible of the Mercedes lineup, but it has a long list of standard features including a 12-way power-adjustable driver’s seat, a seven-inch LCD display, ambient lighting, Bluetooth audio streaming and mobile phone integration. Also standard on this bargain Benz is the advanced Collision Prevention system—typically an expensive option—that applies the brakes to avoid an impending crash with another car and the drowsy-driving detecting Attention Assist system. Rounding out the semi-autonomous vehicle technology is the optional parking assist system that uses sensors to help you parallel or perpendicular park, which is notable since these advanced features are rarely an option in entry-level vehicles. That said, most creature comforts you’ve come to expect are optional, including heated seats, navigation, and voice-activation. And while the standard MBrace integrates your mobile phone with your car’s infotainment system, getting any of the approved apps to appear in the LCD or integrate with the system controls requires you to pony up for a monthly subscription, which is easy to pass on since you shouldn’t be playing with your phone that much anyway. Another interesting option: an in-dash DVD/CD player that allows you to watch DVDs while the car is in park. As with any low-slung coupe (four-doors or otherwise), you don’t buy it for its rear seat.

Those who prioritize power and performance will be making rear-wheel-drive cars their first choice. (The Ford Mustang, the Mazda MX-5 Miata, and the BMW 3 Series are all examples of rear-wheel-drive models.)

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room.

And you can carry a lot of stuff with you: With the rear seats folded, the XC70 offers a generous 72.1 cubic feet of cargo space. In some trim levels, the front passenger seat also folds forward, expanding cargo capacity even further.\n<br><br>\nVolvo has added what it calls Drive-E technology across its lineup, and the XC70 is no exception. What that means is that there is an all-new, 240-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder and eight-speed automatic transmission teamed with ECO+, a fuel-saving technology that uses auto stop/start and other measures to improve gas mileage. The four-cylinder is only available with front-wheel drive, however, so anyone planning to use their XC70 for off-road adventures will have to settle for one of the six-cylinder engines, which are paired with all-wheel drive. We suggest skipping the 240-horsepower 3.2-liter unit, which is being phased out across the Volvo lineup, and going for the 300-horsepower, turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder.\n<br><br>\nThe XC70’s interior boasts the same ultra-supportive seats found in every Volvo—anyone with a bad back would do well to give them a test. Ergonomically, the XC70 is hard to beat, with intuitive controls, like the climate controls shaped like a human—press the legs to direct air to the lower extremities, press the head to direct air out the upper vents, etc.  Mid-year, Volvo introduced a few new standard features, including a leather-wrapped steering wheel and a six-month subscription for On Call, a smartphone app that allows you to control your car remotely. There is also an overhead button in the cabin, similar to GM’s OnStar, that serves as an SOS should you need emergency assistance.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nRevised standard and optional features, and an available 240-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder with automatic stop/start technology and an eight-speed automatic transmission.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volvo XC70","fileMasterId":132184931,"fileName":"volvo-xc70-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132184931/volvo-xc70-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volvo XC70","fileMasterId":132184928,"fileName":"volvo-xc70-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132184928/volvo-xc70-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volvo XC70","fileMasterId":132184925,"fileName":"volvo-xc70-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132184925/volvo-xc70-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":46143,"make":"Volvo","model":"XC70","year":2015},{"id":"1ee83810-cc4f-37cb-a5c8-56efeba61a83","type":"mediaTag","name":"Adventure","path":"/Main/Adventure"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"06b3d1d2-720b-328c-9023-bbe722a7ecea","type":"mediaTag","name":"SUV","path":"/Main/SUV"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:17.047-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866297048 }} },{ "_id":693894,"title":"2015 Volvo XC60","subTitle":"Striking a compelling balance.","slug":"2015-volvo-xc60","promoTitle":"2015 Volvo XC60","promoTeaserSmall":"Striking a compelling balance.","promoTeaser":"Striking a compelling balance.","keywords":["2015 Volvo XC60"],"metaTitle":"2015 Volvo XC60","metaKeywords":["2015 Volvo XC60; Volvo; crossover; SUV; sport-utility; Swedish"],"metaDescription":"Striking a compelling balance.

Even against such a stellar group of competitors, however, the XC60 stands out, striking a compelling balance of performance, comfort, and utility. \n<br><br>\nAs with the rest of the 2015 Volvo lineup, the XC60 has new turbocharged four-cylinder engines using what Volvo calls Drive-E technology. The smaller engines used forced induction to produce similar horsepower to the previous normally aspirated six-cylinder. In addition, an eight-speed transmission helps put the power to the ground with barely perceptible gear changes. These new engines also feature ECO+, which utilizes automatic stop/start and other fuel-saving measures to improve fuel economy by up to five percent.\n<br><br>\nThe two four-cylinder engines are available only with front-wheel drive. If you insist on AWD for your crossover (and many people do), you will have to make do with the carryover five- and six-cylinder inline engines. These powerplants still produce enough power to move the XC60 along at a good page, especially in the T6 AWD R-Design, which is good for an impressive 325 horsepower.\n<br><br>\nThe XC60 is a great example of modern Scandinavian design adapted to the automobile. The floating center stack and swathes of supple leather make the cabin a place where you will be happy to spend your daily commute. And for those times when you need the versatility of a cargo hauler, the XC60 offers 30.8 cubic feet of space behind the second row, and a generous 67.4 cubic feet with the seats folded.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nBoth four-cylinder engines—one turbocharged and one supercharged—are new, as is the eight-speed automatic transmission.

As minivans grew in popularity, wagons began to disappear from the U.S. car scene—much to the consternation of U.S. wagon aficionados. So the announcement that Volvo would be bringing a wagon back to the U.S. market was greeted with great anticipation. \n<br><br>\nThe Volvo V60 has lived up to—and exceeded—expectations. Essentially a wagon version of the S60 sedan, the V60 has many of the same powertrains and features as its sibling. Like the S60, the V60 is available with front- or all-wheel drive, with a four-, five-, or six-cylinder engine, and with a six- or eight-speed automatic transmission. Standard equipment includes heated mirrors, dual-zone climate control, 40/20/40-split rear seats, Bluetooth, and a sunroof. \n<br><br>\nWhat the wagon version offers that the sedan lacks is 43.8 cubic feet of cargo capacity and a Cross Country version. Yes, that’s right, Volvo has brought back the Cross Country name with a go-anywhere version of the V60. The Cross Country is differentiated from the V60 by a honeycomb grille, skid plates, side scuff plates, black fender extensions, and ground clearance that has been raised by 2.6 inches, to 7.9 inches total. The Cross Country is powered by the 250-horsepower five-cylinder and, naturally, comes with all-wheel drive.\n<br><br>\nThe V60 is fun to drive, with well-balanced handling and strong acceleration, no matter which engine you choose. On top of that, the four-cylinder gets 29 mpg in combined city/highway driving, which makes it both fun and practical.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nThe Volvo V60 made its debut for the 2015 model year.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volvo V60","fileMasterId":132183203,"fileName":"volvo-v60-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132183203/volvo-v60-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volvo V60","fileMasterId":132183104,"fileName":"volvo-v60-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132183104/volvo-v60-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volvo V60","fileMasterId":132183200,"fileName":"volvo-v60-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132183200/volvo-v60-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":38662,"make":"Volvo","model":"V60","year":2015},{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":44040,"make":"Volvo","model":"V60 Cross Country","year":2015},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"a3132311-5b4a-3d51-8a35-a7a0398662ca","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sporty","path":"/Main/Sporty"},{"id":"6473b183-0497-321a-a3cb-fcb0645ae243","type":"mediaTag","name":"Crossover","path":"/Main/Crossover"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:17.507-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866297507 }} },{ "_id":693890,"title":"2015 Volvo S80","subTitle":"Sterotypical Swede.","slug":"2015-volvo-s80","promoTitle":"2015 Volvo S80","promoTeaserSmall":"Sterotypical Swede.","promoTeaser":"Sterotypical Swede.","keywords":["2015 Volvo S80"],"metaTitle":"2015 Volvo S80","metaKeywords":["2015 Volvo S80; Volvo; sedan; Swedish"],"metaDescription":"Sterotypical Swede.

This is not to say that the S80 is boring, exactly, but it does favor comfort and smoothness over horsepower and performance. Its compliant suspension softens the impact of potholes and rough roads, and its seats are among the most comfortable and most supportive in the business. \r\n<br><br>\r\nBecause it’s a Volvo, safety is a top priority for the S80. City Safety, a crash avoidance system that automatically brakes the car to avoid or mitigate a collision at speeds of less than 31 mph, is standard, as are air bags all around and active front head restraints. Optional safety equipment include blind-spot monitoring, pedestrian and cyclist detection, lane-departure warning, and driver alert control, which detects erratic driving and brings it to the driver’s attention.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDespite its emphasis on comfort and safety, the S80 has a couple of very capable powertrains. New this year is the T5 Drive-E, a front-wheel-drive model that is powered by a 240-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. The T6 model gets a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six that makes 300 horsepower and comes with a six-speed automatic. The T6 also has all-wheel drive, which comes in handy when the snow flies. The T6 can also be ordered with optional 19-inch wheels and a sport-tuned chassis that sharpens the handling somewhat.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPractical and user-friendly describe the interior. Both the T5 and the T6 are roomy and comfortable, with a spacious trunk and seats that fold down to accommodate long items. The interior is not flashy, but supple leather is standard on the seats, steering wheel, and gearshift knob, and optional on the dashboard. Controls for the climate and audio system are logical and intuitive—just like the S80 itself.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nRevised wheel, trim and package options, and an available 240-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder with automatic stop/start technology and an eight-speed automatic transmission.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Volvo S80","fileMasterId":132182228,"fileName":"volvo-s80-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/132182228/volvo-s80-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":46142,"make":"Volvo","model":"S80","year":2015},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"5fa688e8-6265-3de7-b435-50e0eb2c5d21","type":"mediaTag","name":"Sedan","path":"/Main/Sedan"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:17.737-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866297738 }} },{ "_id":693888,"title":"2015 Volvo S60","subTitle":"A well-balanced premium mid-size sedan.","slug":"2015-volvo-s60","promoTitle":"2015 Volvo S60","promoTeaserSmall":"A well-balanced premium mid-size sedan.","promoTeaser":"A well-balanced premium mid-size sedan.","keywords":["2015 Volvo S60"],"metaTitle":"2015 Volvo S60","metaKeywords":["2015 Volvo S60; Volvo; sedan; Swedish"],"metaDescription":"A well-balanced premium mid-size sedan.

The T5 can be had with either front- or all-wheel drive, a 240-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder or a 250-horsepower, turbocharged inline five-cylinder, and in Premier or Platinum editions. Likewise, the T6 is available with front- or all-wheel drive, but its four-cylinder engine is supercharged and produces 302 horsepower. There is also a 325-horsepower, turbocharged inline six-cylinder on the R-Design model (only available with all-wheel drive), which can reach 60 mph in 5.4 seconds and still get 26 mpg on the highway. All four-cylinder S60s come with an eight-speed automatic transmission, while the five- and six-cylinder models get a six-speed automatic. \n<br><br>\nAll S60s come with a generous list of standard equipment, including front and rear park assist, power heated sideview mirrors, a leather-wrapped adjustable steering wheel, power front seats with adjustable lumbar, dual-zone climate control, and a 60/40-split rear seat. City Safety, Volvo’s safety system that automatically brakes the car to avoid or mitigate a collision at speeds of less than 31 mph, is also standard across the board. Safety has always been one of Volvo’s strengths, and we think it’s worth your while to consider the Technology Package, which includes adaptive cruise control, active collision warning, lane-departure warning, active pedestrian and cyclist detection, distance alert, and active high beams.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\r\nBoth four-cylinder engines—one turbocharged and one supercharged—are new, as is the 8-speed automatic transmission.

The combination of Bluetooth connectivity and Siri is essential for my productivity, safety, and sanity as I run around town, crawl down the highway in congested traffic, or chew off miles on very long road trips.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":5,"text":"<strong>When I am alone in a car and I start to get drowsy, I awaken Siri and begin the hunt for life forms.</strong> I need someone to have a lively conversation with, to while away the miles and reinvigorate me.

Obviously, if I am dangerously tired I will stop and take a break.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Phone 02","caption":"","fileMasterId":133384076,"fileName":"phone-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/133384076/phone-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":6,"text":"I always try to dial through Siri or at a stoplight.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-03T07:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2015-bmw-228i-xdrive-promolarge","title":"2015 Bmw 228I Xdrive Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/133968950/2015-bmw-228i-xdrive-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":133968950,"fileName":"2015-bmw-228i-xdrive-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-03T07:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2015-bmw-228i-xdrive-promolarge","title":"2015 Bmw 228I Xdrive Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/133968950/2015-bmw-228i-xdrive-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":133968950,"fileName":"2015-bmw-228i-xdrive-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-03T07:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2015-bmw-228i-xdrive-header","title":"2015 Bmw 228I Xdrive Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/133968863/2015-bmw-228i-xdrive-header.jpg","fileMasterId":133968863,"fileName":"2015-bmw-228i-xdrive-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":959843,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Four-passenger, all-wheel-drive sport coupe<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $34,850 (prices include destination charge)<br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $41,375<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> Turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, 240 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Eight-speed automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 23 mpg city/35 mpg highway<br>\nSafety: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: Not yet rated; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (2015 BMW 2 Series): <a href=\" http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/bmw/2-series-2-door-coupe\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Top Safety Pick Plus</a><br>\n<strong>Competition</strong> (all prices include destination charges): <br>\n2015 Audi A3 2.0 TFSI ($34,095)<br>\n2015 Lexus IS250 AWD ($40,010)<br>\n2015 Mercedes-Benz CLA250 4Matic ($34,425)<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Fun-o-Meter:</strong> 9<br>\n <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2015 Bmw 228I Xdrive 04","caption":"","fileMasterId":133968845,"fileName":"2015-bmw-228i-xdrive-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/133968845/2015-bmw-228i-xdrive-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Why, do you ever wonder, do BMW drivers have a certain reputation?</strong> It’s because they are not necessarily doing what other people are doing when they are driving down the road.

Longer and wider—yet 200 pounds lighter—than the previous generation, the compact sedan grew a bit for 2015 to keep up with market trends and its customers’ growing proportions. It’s available in a coupe or sedan and with a range of engine options, from a relatively efficient 201-horsepower, turbo 1.8-liter 4-cylinder to the 503-horsepower, twin-turbo 4.0-liter in the range-topping C63 S AMG. There is little to complain about with the interior, except perhaps the Comand  infotainment system, which is an acquired taste and thankfully optional on some models.

For the moment, the electric hatchback is only available in eleven states, although fifty-state availability is expected. The B-Class seats five, offers a decent 21 cubic feet of cargo capacity behind the rear seats, and retains some of its European design features such as fold-down trays for the rear passenger. The B-Class offers some of Mercedes’ more advanced safety features, including Collision Prevention Assist Plus, which automatically applies the brakes if it detects the vehicle is not braking hard enough to avoid an impending collision. You will still pay extra for features that you might expect standard on a vehicle this pricey and technologically advanced, such as heated seats and a rearview camera. <br><br>But as with most electric cars, the majority of the attention tends to be paid to what’s under the hood rather than interior amenities. The electric B-Class is equipped with an electric motor that offers an equivalent 177 horsepower and an impressive 251 pound-feet of torque and moves it from 0 to 60 mph in 7.9 seconds. Mercedes estimates that the real-world driving range of the B-Class is nearly 100 miles, but the EPA estimate is a little lower at 87 miles. Charging times from empty are two hours for a 60-mile driving range and 3.5 hours for a full charge. There isn’t a quick charge option. This means you need to plan your road trips accordingly. However, Mercedes has equipped the electric B-Class with an “extended range” option that makes the battery’s full 36-kWh capacity available, and increases the estimated driving range by 25 to 30 percent. But keep in mind, the fine print states that overuse of this option can increase battery degradation.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2015</h3>\nThe B-Class Electric Drive is all-new for 2015.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz B-class interior","fileMasterId":129235610,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/129235610/mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz B-class","fileMasterId":129235604,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/129235604/mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz B-class","fileMasterId":129235598,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/129235598/mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2015 Mercedes-Benz B-class","fileMasterId":129235595,"fileName":"mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/129235595/mercedesbenz-bclass-2015-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45967,"make":"Mercedes-Benz","model":"B-Class","year":2015},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"dc201000-35b3-3700-b51e-cd3d330e13b8","type":"mediaTag","name":"Green","path":"/Main/Green"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:20.781-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866300782 }} },{ "_id":694529,"title":"3 Pet Carriers Pass New Safety Tests","subTitle":"Subaru and Center for Pet Safety answer the question: Is your dog's crate or carrier safe in the car?","slug":"3-pet-carriers-pass-new-safety-tests","promoTitle":"3 Pet Carriers Pass New Safety Tests","promoTeaserSmall":"Subaru and Center for Pet Safety answer the question: Is your dog's crate or carrier safe in the car?","promoTeaser":"Subaru and Center for Pet Safety answer the question: Is your dog's crate or carrier safe in the car?","keywords":["3 Pet Carriers Pass New Safety Tests"],"metaTitle":"3 Pet Carriers Pass New Safety Tests -

Ahrens","firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Ahrens","jobTitle":"Contributing Writer","enableBioPage":true,"bio":"When <em>Automobile</em> launched in 1986, my byline appeared on a sidebar to the cover story written by our founding editor David E. Davis, Jr. Yet it wasn’t inevitable that I’d write for the magazine, even though my childhood was heavily automobile-flavored: my father raced jalopies and late-model stock cars on the oval tracks around Omaha, Nebraska, where we lived, and my favorite uncle liked drag racing and hot rods. \n<br><br>\nAfter earning a B.A. in English from the University of Nebraska, I moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. Instead, though, I ended up holding cue cards on TV shows, including the soap opera<em> Days of Our Lives</em>. My first magazine story, the inside scoop on how we prepared those cue cards, appeared with my own photos in <em>Soap Opera Digest</em>.\n<br><br>\nIn my freelance career, I’ve written for <em>Bon Appétit</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and many others. I started corresponding for the Automobiles desk at the <em>New York Times</em> in 2010, which is proving to be a great relationship. As a change of pace, my historical column for <em>DBusiness</em> (“Detroit’s Premier Business Journal”) has run since 2006. But while a food-and-wine tour can get boring after a couple of days, nothing beats a call from <em>Automobile</em>. I’ve been behind the wheel of everything from a Ferrari 458 Italia (“Blood Red to Goodwood,” March 2011) to the Fiat 500 Abarth. On assignment for “Three Zero Heroes,” I co-drove the winning BMW X3 in the 2004 Alcan Winter Rally. Teaming again with the same navigator, we won the 2006 Carolina Trophy, bulldogging a 1951 Chrysler Saratoga to the finish for “Substance over Style.”\n<br><br>\nOther assignments have placed me not only in the driver’s seat of a Porsche 911 Targa for the 2002 Targa Newfoundland, a plummy nod that seemed to indicate my editors’ favor, but also in the co-driver’s seat of a Class 1 buggy for the 2003 Baja 1000, suggesting they wanted me dead.\n<br><br>\nAs you might guess, there’s no regret about failing as a screenwriter. And now I’m beginning something new: teaching automotive journalism at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. My workshop, Creating Content for Automotive Media, launched in 2012 and will be offered twice a year. I look forward to helping students along on their way to incomparable automotive adventures and working with the best editors in the business.","fileMasterId":74355027,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/74355027/74355027.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2026,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/#!/baggyparagraphs"},{"id":2027,"linkType":"Personal Site","linkUrl":"http://www.baggyparagraphs.com"}],"websiteIds":[3002,5799,6202013,6202044,6202071,6202077,6202078,6202085]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Style","id":1034788,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/car-life/style","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"Car Life","id":1034770,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/car-life","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-06T13:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"8-track-credit-promolarge-czmarlin","title":"8 Track Credit Promolarge Czmarlin","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/134729231/8-track-credit-promolarge-CZMarlin.jpg","fileMasterId":134729231,"fileName":"8-track-credit-promolarge-CZMarlin.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-06T13:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"8-track-credit-promolarge-czmarlin","title":"8 Track Credit Promolarge Czmarlin","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/134729231/8-track-credit-promolarge-CZMarlin.jpg","fileMasterId":134729231,"fileName":"8-track-credit-promolarge-CZMarlin.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-06T13:14:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"8-track-credit-header-czmarlin","title":"8 Track Credit Header Czmarlin","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/134729054/8-track-credit-header-CZMarlin.jpg","fileMasterId":134729054,"fileName":"8-track-credit-header-CZMarlin.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":954881,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"Lifestyle factors and improving technology have changed how we maintain, accessorize, and adorn our cars.

Through the mid-century, some people added an external evaporative cooler, a large cylinder with an internal water tank that clung like a barnacle to the car’s roofline. As the water evaporated by the force of wind, cool air came inside. (Of course, it only worked when the car was moving.) Packard introduced an integrated refrigerated air conditioning system in 1939, charging a whopping $274 for the option. (A new Ford cost as little as $660 that year.) By the late 1960s, about 50 percent of all cars were equipped with A/C.

That’s great for thrashing around in an older car. Much more effective heated and cooled seats are available in a wide variety of new cars.

CB radio/eight-track player</h3> \nThe citizens band radio provided a way to communicate between vehicles, a useful thing when the national 55-mph speed limit went into effect in 1973. In response, cars and trucks teamed up in convoys to drive faster. Around the same time, accessory eight-track tape decks were mounted below dashboards. Great for Aerosmith, bad for knees. Currently, speed limits as high as 85 mph in some places now have drivers singing a happy tune, no longer calling out a CB handle such as River Rat or Cycle Smoker. As autonomous vehicle technology spreads, cars will talk to one another. As for Aerosmith, Bluetooth streaming delivers them from your iPod to the audio system.","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"Rambler American 1St Generation Black Sedan Credit Czmarlin","caption":"","fileMasterId":134729249,"fileName":"rambler-american-1st-generation-black-sedan-credit-CZMarlin.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/134729249/rambler-american-1st-generation-black-sedan-credit-CZMarlin.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":6,"text":"<h3>6.

Even if I know the answer to my own problem or question, I still like to double check, and like our good friend <a href=\"https://youtu.be/lp-EO5I60KA\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ed Sheeran</a>, I suffer from a little syndrome called “thinking out loud.” I will return from college after not driving for five months, hop in the car, and to my mother’s horror, ask aloud, “Hm, which one is the brake again?” You can stop composing the petition to have my license revoked; I promise I know where the brake is. When getting back in the swing of things, though, I mentally and often verbally go over some basics, causing my parents to seriously doubt my driving abilities. I know I’m not alone here. If you’re like me, by simply holding in the rhetorical questions and Googling topics you want to double check, you can save yourself some embarrassment and your parents some worry.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":7,"text":"<strong>2. Turn the music down.</strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":8,"text":"I don’t care how fabulous a driver you are; if I am two lanes over and can hear the bass thumping in your car, I will steer clear. Adults especially take loud music as a sign of distracted driving. When you’re driving with older passengers, pick a station, set it to an appropriate volume, and leave it, at least until the next stoplight. If you’re alone in the car and simply need to listen to Taylor Swift at level 30, turn it down when you pull in to your neighborhood. Nothing screams “safe driver” quite like my little sister whipping into the driveway with Lil Jon’s “Turn Down for What” blasting through the open windows. In reality, she is a perfectly fine driver, but when you sit shotgun in a car operated by a seventeen-year-old whom you cannot even hear over the music, your life occasionally flashes before your eyes. Do yourself a favor and keep it down.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","text":"I can parallel park downtown without so much as a wrinkled forehead when my best friend is in the car, but with my dad in the car I struggle even to go the speed limit.","type":"blockquote"},{"order":10,"text":"<h3>For adults:</h3>\n<strong>1. Try to pay as much attention to your child’s driving as you would to any other adult’s driving.</strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":11,"text":"Would you criticize your colleague’s hand placement on the wheel? Actually, would you even notice your colleague’s hand placement? Probably not, because you have some degree of faith in other adults’ driving abilities. Try to pretend, if only for a moment, that the teenager you are riding alongside is twenty-eight years old and perfectly capable. Hopefully, you will find fewer glaring errors in their driving once you exit that hyper aware state of mind. Personally, my confidence behind the wheel is inversely related to how much my passengers care about my driving. I can parallel park in downtown Birmingham without so much as a wrinkled forehead when my best friend is in the car, but when my dad sits in the front seat I struggle to even go the speed limit. Give yourself and your young driver a much-needed pressure relief.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":12,"text":"<strong>2. When giving tips, keep your voice calm and casual.</strong>","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"right","text":"Parents: When you come across a teachable moment in the car, give instructions in the same voice you would use for ordering lunch.","type":"blockquote"},{"order":14,"text":"My mom is infamous in our family for tightly gripping the handle above her seat and calling to my dad in a panic-filled voice when one of the four kids drives during the newly licensed period. Anyone, regardless of age, would feel rather unconfident if their passenger suggested in a half yell that they slow down and maybe pull over so everyone can take a moment to collect themselves. <br>\n<br>\nRecognize that teenagers are indeed new to the driving world and probably feel more nervous about that upcoming left turn than you do. When you come across a teachable moment in the car, give instructions in the same voice you would use for ordering lunch. Clearly express what you would like to see your young driver do, but keep your tone chatty and unconcerned. Yes, you want Panera to hold the onions on your salad, but if you spy some white and purple rings in the bowl you will not break into a lecture about disregard for safety and the diminishing value placed on focus in today’s generation. Same goes for riding with teenage drivers.","type":"paragraph"}]}],"tags":[{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":3},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:23.065-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866303066 }} },{ "_id":694639,"title":"2016 Honda HR-V: Jean's Driveway","subTitle":"Does the all-new subcompact SUV fit you?

This car’s price cut is meant to turn heads as much as its curves do to get buyers shopping for the most performance under $100,000. What they’ll find is that its muscular and aggressive body—with its aluminum doors and carbon fiber hood, roof, and deck lid—are not just for looks: they improve aerodynamics and stability as much as style. All models are equipped with the standard 8.4-liter V-10 engine that produces 645 horsepower and 600 pound-feet of torque and are paired only with a six-speed manual transmission. The top track speed of the Viper is rated at 206 mph, and it launches from a stop to 60 mph in around three seconds. But getting there presents its own challenges, so launch control is a standard feature, and the five-mode electronic stability control system on the GT model (standard is three-mode) will keep you on the track and out of the ditches. The interior can be described as mission control chic. The deep racing seats of this two-seater set the tone for serious performance driving, and the traction and launch control button mounted on the steering wheel give it that track car feel. Creature comforts like heated and ventilated seats and a telescoping steering wheel are absent, but technological conveniences such as the Uconnect 8.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system with navigation, satellite radio, and voice command Bluetooth connectivity are standard.

More than 10 million have been built in North America, in fact, so many that the Honda dealers could put up a McDonald's-style \"Millions Served\" sign if they wanted. But does ubiquity lead to contempt? Not in our book. The Accord has won a place in so many driveways precisely because it's so well executed. Buyers flock to it knowing they can count on it to be well built and reliable as well as comfortable and drivable. If there's a little less excitement than with a lot of other cars you could choose, well, it's a mid-size, front-wheel-drive sedan, not a sports car. 2016 brings changes to the ninth-generation Accord that was introduced for 2013.

Honda Odyssey has been the choice for years of people with large families and a taste for comfort. For 2016, Honda has added a new Special Edition model that brings some of the highest-end amenities down to a more affordable price point. Among them are the vaunted HondaVAC in-vehicle vacuum cleaner and a rear-seat entertainment system. You'll find that, with so many trim levels (eight!), you won't be scratching your head checking out an à la carte options list. Instead, move to the EX-L model and up to get a leather-wrapped steering wheel and seats, heated front seats, a power moonroof that tilts, and best of all, a power tailgate. Forward collision warning, lane departure warning, and Honda's unequaled multi-angle rearview camera with guidelines come with the EX-L and up, too. All but the base LX seat up to eight, with five car seat anchors—with the idea that you have flexibility, not that you'll be carrying five kids in car seats! But, even if you are, this is one vehicle that can handle it. It also tows up to 3,500 pounds and has a full 172.6 cubic feet inside, so you get it all: as much luxury as you want in your minivan, plus a whole lot of capability.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>New for 2016:</strong>\r\nNew \"high value\" Special Edition (SE) model with rear-seat entertainment, SiriusXM satellite radio, and HondaVAC vacuum cleaner.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541270,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-08.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541270/honda-odyssey-2016-08.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541138,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-05.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541138/honda-odyssey-2016-05.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541273,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541273/honda-odyssey-2016-header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541132,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541132/honda-odyssey-2016-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541261,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541261/honda-odyssey-2016-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541141,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541141/honda-odyssey-2016-07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541135,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541135/honda-odyssey-2016-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Odyssey.","fileMasterId":136541258,"fileName":"honda-odyssey-2016-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136541258/honda-odyssey-2016-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":46311,"make":"Honda","model":"Odyssey","year":2016},{"id":"46f5f7ad-5147-34c4-8286-c75fb1312eff","type":"mediaTag","name":"Luxury","path":"/Main/Luxury"},{"id":"aaee0704-dea3-375c-9919-2b1d7bd294d0","type":"mediaTag","name":"Family","path":"/Main/Family"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":2},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:25.810-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866305811 }} },{ "_id":695353,"title":"2015 Jeep Cherokee Latitude 4x4","subTitle":"You may call it a crossover, but it’s really a Jeep.

I have been writing about cars and the car business for more than 30 years, having learned about cars at the kitchen table from my late father, Robert Lienert, who was the editor of Automotive News. At age eighteen, I bought a used car, painted it yellow, installed a toplight and a meter, and joined the Yellow Cab Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as an owner/operator. Five years later, I got a job at Chrysler’s test track as a test driver, welder, and mechanic in the impact lab. In 1980, I was hired as a writer at Car and Driver magazine after getting laid off at Chrysler, and in 1985 I left to establish Automobile Magazine with David E. Davis, Jr. I was the magazine’s first Executive Editor, became Editor in Chief in 2000, and added the title of President of Automobile Magazine in 2006.\n\nI’ve been profiled in The New Yorker and have been a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. I was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, teaching Oprah and her studio audience how to change a tire and to jump a battery. I was Good Morning America’s automotive correspondent from 1994 to 2000 and then did the same thing for the Oxygen network.\n\n I have won awards for feature writing, car reviews, and my monthly Automobile Magazine column, “Vile Gossip,” including the 2007 Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism.  I’m a regular on-air contributor to Fox Business Network; CNBC’s Closing Bell, Squawk Box, Behind the Wheel, and Power Lunch; MSNBC; CBS This Morning and Evening News; and CNN’s American Morning and Headline News. In fact, I would almost call myself a TV slut, but I’m proud to say that I turned Geraldo down.\n\nAll of this has taken place in a male-dominated automotive space, where I’m all too frequently the only woman in the room. I know the secret handshake, but JeanKnowsCars.com is going to be a place where you don’t have to. \n\nI live in the Michigan countryside with my husband, Tim, and the entire food chain. You’re going to get to know my driveway and my dogs really, really well. Just keep reading.","fileMasterId":40791058,"downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/40791058/40791058.jpg","socialLinks":[{"id":2125,"linkType":"Email","linkUrl":"jean.jennings@sorc.com"},{"id":2126,"linkType":"Twitter","linkUrl":"https://twitter.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2127,"linkType":"Facebook","linkUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/JeanKnowsCars"},{"id":2128,"linkType":"Google+","linkUrl":"https://plus.google.com/112100834357947783048/posts"}],"websiteIds":[3002,6202044]}],"categories":[{"alias":"Buying","id":1034955,"isPrimary":true,"name":"/you-auto-know/car-buying","website":"jeanknowscars.com"},{"alias":"You Auto Know","id":1034954,"isPrimary":false,"name":"/you-auto-know","website":"jeanknowscars.com"}],"relatedArticles":[],"headerImages":{"promoLarge":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-14T11:09:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2015-jeep-cherokee-latitude-promolarge","title":"2015 Jeep Cherokee Latitude Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136685354/2015-jeep-cherokee-latitude-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":136685354,"fileName":"2015-jeep-cherokee-latitude-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_large","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"promoSmall":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-14T11:09:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2015-jeep-cherokee-latitude-promolarge","title":"2015 Jeep Cherokee Latitude Promolarge","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136685354/2015-jeep-cherokee-latitude-promolarge.jpg","fileMasterId":136685354,"fileName":"2015-jeep-cherokee-latitude-promolarge.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"promo_small","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":317},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":650}},"header":{"alignment":"center","caption":"","createdOn":"2015-08-14T11:09:00.000Z","keywords":"","orientation":"unknown","subTitle":"2015-jeep-cherokee-latitude-header","title":"2015 Jeep Cherokee Latitude Header","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136685411/2015-jeep-cherokee-latitude-header.jpg","fileMasterId":136685411,"fileName":"2015-jeep-cherokee-latitude-header.jpg","textWrap":"block","imageType":"header","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}},"pages":[{"id":961129,"metaDescription":"","metaKeywords":[""],"metaTitle":"","name":"index","order":0,"vehicles":[],"pageElements":[{"order":0,"text":"<strong>Type:</strong> Five-passenger, all-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle<br>\n<strong>Trim levels:</strong> Sport, Latitude, Limited, Trailhawk<br>\n<strong>Base price:</strong> $28,090 (prices include destination charge) <br>\n<strong>This car:</strong> $33,825 <br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong> 3.2-liter V-6, 271 horsepower<br>\n<strong>Transmission:</strong> Nine-speed automatic<br>\n<strong>Fuel economy:</strong> 20 mpg city/28 mpg highway<br>\n<strong>Safety:</strong> National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: <a href=\"http://www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Vehicle-Detail?vehicleId=9206\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">4/5 stars</a>; Insurance Institute for Highway Safety: <a href=\"http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/jeep/cherokee-4-door-suv\" title=\"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Good</a> in 4 of 5 categories<br>\n<strong>You might also be considering</strong> (all prices include destination charges): <br>\n2016 Ford Escape SE AWD ($27,805)<br>\n2015 Honda CR-V EX AWD ($27,675)<br>\n2016 Subaru Forester 2.5i Premium ($26,645)<br>\n2015 Toyota RAV4 XLE AWD ($27,525)<br>","type":"paragraph"},{"image":{"alignment":"right","altText":"2015 Jeep Cherokee Latitude 02","caption":"","fileMasterId":136685270,"fileName":"2015-jeep-cherokee-latitude-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136685270/2015-jeep-cherokee-latitude-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_large","order":0,"showInGallery":false,"textWrap":"wraptext","height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},"order":1,"text":"<strong>Fun-O-Meter:</strong> 10 <br>","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<strong>There are a few names in the automotive world that paint an immediate mental picture:</strong> Corvette. 911.

With seats in place, the Fit offers 16.6 cubic feet of cargo space, which is more than you'll see in competitors such as the Chevrolet Sonic or Ford Fiesta hatchback (both at 14.9) and the Kia Rio five-door (12.3).  Fold down the seats—which go flat thanks to the instant-folding Magic Seat feature—and the yield is 52.7 cubic feet, again more than the competition. Fuel economy skirts around the all-important 40-mpg level on the highway, depending on whether you choose the more efficient continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) or the six-speed manual. The base LX and midlevel EX models have the six-speed manual as standard, while the top EX-L model comes only with the CVT. Paddle shifters are an option to liven up your CVT experience on the EX; they're standard on the EX-L.  Other creature comforts if you opt for the EX-L are leather-trimmed seats and steering wheel, heated front seats, and, for an added $1,000, a navigation system with voice recognition and HD digital traffic, making the best use of the seven-inch touchscreen. (That screen is also found on the EX, but the LX gets a five-inch touchscreen.) Both EX and EX-L models have options including a power moonroof with a tilt feature, push-button start, and Honda's Lane Watch, which shows live video from a camera on your passenger's-side mirror when you turn your right turn signal on (EX, EX-L). That's what you call exceeding expectations; not only will you get used to this feature, you won't remember how you got along without it. You won't forget the diminutive size of the car you're driving  if you choose the Fit, but you won't feel like you've cheaped out; in fact, you'll feel like you're driving a modern, well-appointed, up-to-date vehicle, a good feeling anytime and especially at this price point.","type":"paragraph"},{"order":2,"text":"<h3>New for 2016:</h3>\nThe Fit's third generation was all new for 2015 and continues unchanged this year.","type":"paragraph"},{"alignment":"center","images":[{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542362,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-03.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542362/honda-fit-2016-03.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":0,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542275,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-06.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542275/honda-fit-2016-06.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":1,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542371,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-07.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542371/honda-fit-2016-07.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":2,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542272,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-04.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542272/honda-fit-2016-04.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":3,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542278,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-08.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542278/honda-fit-2016-08.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":4,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542374,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-header.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542374/honda-fit-2016-header.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":5,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542269,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-02.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542269/honda-fit-2016-02.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":6,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}},{"alignment":"center","caption":"2016 Honda Fit.","fileMasterId":136542359,"fileName":"honda-fit-2016-01.jpg","downLoadUrl":"http://image.adam.automotive.com/f/136542359/honda-fit-2016-01.jpg","imageSize":"inline_medium","order":7,"showInGallery":true,"height":{"unitCode":"px","value":407},"width":{"unitCode":"px","value":640}}],"imagesPerLine":3,"order":3,"textWrap":"topandbottom","type":"imagegroup","title":"","titleType":"normal","titleAlignment":"center"}]}],"tags":[{"type":"vehicleTag","bodyStyle":"","classGroup":"","color":"","id":45960,"make":"Honda","model":"Fit","year":2016},{"id":"417a0822-407f-3146-83b9-d240ad2179c4","type":"mediaTag","name":"Hatchback","path":"/Main/Hatchback"},{"id":"71d39f07-0bc5-39bd-9468-12085dc13b7c","type":"mediaTag","name":"First_Car","path":"/Main/First_Car"},{"id":"b3434f68-a458-346e-987b-3fec495c6530","type":"brandTag","brandId":6202044}],"globalizations":[],"originator":{"origin":"Adam","version":4},"vendors":[],"canonicalUrl":"","isNoIndexSearch":false,"showOemAds":false,"issueIdentifier":"","lastModifiedDate":"2016-02-18T22:18:27.166-08:00","isStandOut":false,"deleted":false,"websiteIds":[6202044],"internal" : { "lastModifiedDate" : {"$date": 1455866307166 }} } ]
