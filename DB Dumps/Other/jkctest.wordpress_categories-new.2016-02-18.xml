Nissan has since expanded into bigger cars, and now sells a whole complement of family vehicles. The company shares a lot of mechanical parts with its luxury arm, Infiniti, and Nissans are typically high quality, dependable cars. Nissans are often owned by professionals looking for a safe, comfortable car. The company has rarely been a style leader, but has also rarely produced cars that confuse the eye. Possible exception?

The cars aren?t just expensive, though. They are also beautiful and immediately recognizable. After shuffling between owners in the early 2000s, Roll-Royce is now comfortably installed as part of the BMW group, and has rebounded from a serious sales slump to sell its highest-ever volume of cars in 2011.

Smart?s only model is famous for its tiny profile and impressive ability to park in tight spots. The brand?s commitment to innovative thinking continues with the manufacture of an electric model starting this year.

Everywhere else in the world, the cars retain the Honda name. Most Acuras are based on Honda chassis and powertrains but with a much higher level of trim and luxury equipment.

Never profitable, but offering very high quality, Aston Martin has had many designers and a lot of owners and has suffered some quality problems over the years. Ford bought Aston Martin in 1987, at a time when all the Detroit automakers were snapping up European marques, and ultimately saved the company. During that time, improvements were made in quality, design, and engines. Today Aston Martin is under different leadership--Ford sold it in 2006--but despite some struggles, Aston Martins continue to be distinct and serious luxury high-performance cars. Take care, though: they?re not supercars ? they are gentleman?s motor carriages. ]]></wp:category_description></wp:category>

Owned by Rolls-Royce from 1931 until the turn of the 21st century, Bentley came under Volkswagen ownership in 2002. Volkswagen lost out on the deal for Rolls-Royce to BMW and has exacted its revenge by pouring all its energy into returning a performance aura to the company and creating a serious, high-performance luxury car that will go head to head with Rolls-Royce. For a car of its mass, a Bentley is quite understated. If you saw one on the street, you might not know immediately what it was. Bentley has been hugely successful at selling its cars with prices of a quarter of a million dollars and has established a market for such high-priced cars that has other luxury automakers drooling.]]></wp:category_description></wp:category>

In the meantime, GM has put a lot of energy into turning it into a near-luxury American brand that competes with Audi and Volvo. In the past, Buicks were purchased for their reputation as a car you could count on. Today\'s Buick has significantly improved in quality in the past ten years in both finish and materials and is fast, understated, luxurious, and reliable. Current Buick buyers are looking for understated luxury in a large car at a good price.

An early tagline was Standard of the World, and despite having slipped seriously, Caddy is making a comeback. This year?s ATS has been lauded as Cadillac?s first serious, well-executed small car, and touted as a serious competitor to the BMW 3 series.
